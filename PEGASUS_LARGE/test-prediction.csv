0,9712593,"The results showed the benefit of dietetic treatment in experimental patients with head and neck or abdominopelvic cancer In recent years, the concept of nutritional support as a part of a comprehensive cancer management program has gained increasing acceptability. In 1977 we undertook to study this problem in a r and omized prospect i ve study design ed to evaluate the effects of long-term ( 12 months ) enteral nutritional supplementation compared to a group of ambulatory breast cancer patients undergoing a st and ard chemotherapy treatment program."
1,10103327,"MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Proportion of children immunized and screened for anemia, TB and lead poisoning by 24 months of age and immunization and screening rates of the practice s.

2,10567628,Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) often subjectively benefit from inhaled R2-agonists in spite of little or no demonstrable effect in forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1.0 ). The dry powder inhaler methods Turbuhaler is a suitable alternative to a metered dose inhaler in the delivery of terbutaline to preschool children with stable asthma if adequate inhalational technique is used In the near future it is to be expected that many metered-dose inhalers will be used to deliver the inhaled corticosteroid.

4,10796140,"The correlation between a high ratio for packed cell volume supplements and poor fetal growth thus supplementation may not be caused by iron supplementation, nor mediated by blood pressure ; the greatest number of patients receiving antimalarial prophylaxis ( groups not receiving iron ) and malaria prophylaxis in only 18 % of the population was not recommended. Folic acid was well absorbed in group 1 ), and groups 2 and 3 showed no effect on malaria treatment ( regimens recommended for pregnant women were not treated in the trial and patients received only proguanil )."
5,10796175,"Two hundred Hausa primigravidae guinea at Zaria were divided into five groups in a r and omized double-blind trial of antenatal oral antimalarial prophylaxis, and haematinic supplements. Groups 2 to 5 were given chloroquine 600 mg base once and, followed by proguanil 100 mg per day ; the other groups received iron 60 mg daily and iron plus folic acid. Forty-five percent were anaemic ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) less than 11.0 g dl-1 ), and malaria parasitaemia ( predominantly Plasmodium falciparum ] was seen in 27 % of those not receiving active treatment ( group 1 ). Only five patients in the others groups developed severe anaemia  ( P = 0.006 exp., 44 patients had malaria following failure to take treatment ]. Patients in group 3 had the lowest mean hb at 28 and 36 weeks of gestation (, groups 3 and 5 ); patients receiving iron ( groups 2 and 4 )? Anaemia was significantly reduced in subjects with malaria : the incidence of malaria was reduced by 50 % in those who received anti-malarials and by 60 % for those receiving antifolic acid!"
6,10796372,The study did not determine whether more efficient management of these neonates with regard to their vitamin A nutrition and early achievement of vitamin E sufficiency could result in a decrease in the incidence and severity of BPD BACKGROUND Intramuscular supplementation with Vitamin A in large doses may reduce the occurrence of chronic lung disease.
7,10796407,"When self-regulatory feeding policies based on early hunger cues are not allowed, nonnutritive sucking for 5 minutes pre-feeding is simple and brief. These findings confirm those from earlier less conclusive research and indicate that nonnutritional sucking modulates behavioral state to facilitate premature feedings ; the results tested suggest that there are fewer behavioral changes in preterm infants following NNS = 1,649  SD = 31.6 g [*] and motilin ed in neonatal intensive care units )."
8,10796465,"The same kind of psychogenic reaction may also be involved in the bronchodilator response to needle acupuncture in asthma In 25 patients with moderate to severe asthma, we compared the therapeutic effectiveness of classic Chinese acupuncture with that of "" placebo "" acupuncture administered in a r and omly ordered acupuncture treatment twice weekly for 4 weeks."
9,10796563,"It was also established that the most intense serotype response to the WC vaccine and the least severe cholera vaccine induced in the vaccinated population was observed in a study of the first batch of WC/BS vaccines, which was administered in 1965. We conclude that it was possible to demonstrate the effect of a single injection of cholera vaccines per head on the proportion of people with detectable vibriocidal and agglutinating antibody ; the impact of these vaccines on older persons was not statistically significant when administered by a heat syringe or by coronavirus vaccine in rural Bangladesh?"
10,10796632,"In children treated with BDP alone, budesonide produced lower doses ( 95 % ) than placebo ( 1500 micrograms ), produced greater potency ( 91.9 % CI) versus placebo at 1600 micrograms ( 2000 nmol/l ). Fluticasone produced higher doses of budone propionate ( 1000 micrograms) compared with placebo : 15 micrograms at 1000 smol ( 500 g) and 10 micrograms in 1000 mg."
11,10796868,"One deficiency with these trials was that they did not include adequate TNM staging, and so the present r and omised trial was design ed to compare surgery alone ( S ) with surgery plus post-operative radiotherapy ( SR ), in patients with pathologically staged N1 - 2. Patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the G1 group showed a positive trend in local recurrence (P=0.039 )."

14,11034671,"Children in the treatment group received 500 microg ( 2.5 ml ) of ipratropium bromide with the second and third doses of albuterol ; the results of the overall quality study were evaluated by a meta-analysis of pooled data from 66 studies, which included the effect of antispermia therapy with high-quality strogen therapy. CONCLUSION To test the hypothesis that the inclusion of poor- quality studies with a quantitative method to subfertile treatment may lead to bias in treatment trials ( 51 of 136 children [ 32.6 percent ] ), as compared with 71 of 135 [ 52.6percent ], in a control group ( P=0.02 )."
15,11034751,"The vaccine combination of H3N2 and H1N1 antibodies did not elicit higher antibody responses in the vaccine group than in other vaccine groups; however, there was a significant difference between the subunit and tween-ether-split-vaccine groups. Cold-activated, reassortant influenza B vaccines are safe for the elderly and those with chronic illness but are not optimally immunogenic in this group These studies indicate that the high-risk and normal pediatric population s can be safely and effectively immunized with a two-dose regimen of the influenza A/New Jersey/76 virus vaccine ( )."

The proportion of patients entering first remission ( methotrexate, 46.7 % ; placebo [ 25 % = intramuscular ] ), the time to reach second remission : methotrexate ( 4.1 + /- 1.9 months ); placebo  methotrexate / methotrexate-containing months ( 3.4 + methotrexate/ methotrexate) ) was not significantly different between the two groups ). CONCLUSIONS Methotrexate at a weekly oral dose of 12.5 mg (12.5 % placebo) is not found to be better than placebo in induction or maintenance of remission in patients with chronic active Crohn's disease (UC) without a clinical subscore of 25? The primary end-points included methotrexate at both weeks of Crohn's remission and placebo at the end of the trial (25 % remission) but methotrexate has never been given as a placebo group ( -7.5 % efficacy at 16 weeks ): methotrexate is an effective corticosteroid for patients without Crohn s colitis ( UC BACKGROUND) and has been evaluated in four cases with Crohn-free remission at 21 weeks (P = 0.001)!"
