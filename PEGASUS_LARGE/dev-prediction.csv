2013,32350578,"In this study performed with computer assisted system, we compared the 2 different methods in 126 patients followed prospect ively in order to analyze the effect of both the techniques on joint-line ( JL ) maintenance and axial limb restoration and components position. The gap technique showed a statistical increase in the post-operative value when compared with the measured resection technique ( ( P = 0.008 ). When comparing the two groups regarding to the pre-surgical deformity ( less than 10  limb angle ), we have found a statistically difference ( p = 0.011 ] in case of moderate pre–operative deformity ; however, as the measurements of the femoral component angle were found to be biased in favor of valgus ( HKD-rectangular alignment was used to assess the clinical outcome ( 3D alignment > 3 ct) and the radiological outcome was not aligned ( TKS group) to improve the patient's clinical orientation ( DFA)."
