            "BACKGROUND AND AIMS Preoperative intake of a clear carbohydrate-rich drink reduces  insulin resistance after surgery . In this study , we evaluated whether this could be related to increased insulin sensitivity at the onset of surgery . Furthermore , we aim ed to establish the optimal dose-regimen . METHODS Six healthy volunteers underwent hyperinsulinaemic ( 0.8 mU/kg/min ) , normoglycaemic ( 4.5 mmol/l ) clamps and indirect calorimetry on four occasions in a crossover-r and omised order ;  after overnight fasting ( CC ) , after a single evening dose ( 800 ml ) of the drink ( LC ) , after a single morning dose ( 400 ml , CL ) and after intake of the drink in the evening and in the morning before the clamp ( LL ) . Data are presented as mean+/-SD . Statistical analysis was performed using the Student 's t-test and ANOVA . RESULTS Insulin sensitivity was higher in CL and LL ( 9.2+/-1.5 and 9.3+/-1.9 mg/kg/min , respectively ) compared to CC and LC ( 6.1+/-1.6 and 6.6+/-1.9 mg/kg/min , P<0.01 vs. CL and LL ) . CONCLUSIONS A carbohydrate-rich drink enhances insulin action 3 h later by approximately 50 % . Enhanced insulin action to normal postpr and ial day-time level at the time of onset of anaesthesia or surgery is likely to , at least partly , explain the effects on postoperative insulin resistance\n"

              "'ARTICLE 1: Although transplantation of adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( BM-MSCs ) holds promise in the treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , the poor survival and differentiation potential of adult BM-MSCs have limited their therapeutic efficiency . Here , we compared the therapeutic efficacy of human embryonic stem cell-derived MSCs ( hESC-MSCs ) with adult BM-MSCs for the treatment of PAH in an animal model . One week following monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH , mice were r and omly assigned to receive phosphate-buffered saline ( MCT group ) ; 3.0 × 106 human BM-derived MSCs ( BM-MSCs group ) or 3.0 × 106 hESC-derived MSCs ( hESC-MSCs group ) via tail vein injection . At 3 weeks posttransplantation , the right ventricular systolic pressure ( RVSP ) , degree of RV hypertrophy , and medial wall thickening of pulmonary arteries were lower= , and pulmonary capillary density was higher in the hESC-MSC group as compared with BM-MSC and MCT groups ( all p < 0.05 ) . At 1 week posttransplantation , the number of engrafted MSCs in the lungs was found significantly higher in the hESC-MSC group than in the BM-MSC group ( all p < 0.01 ) . At 3 weeks posttransplantation , implanted BM-MSCs were undetectable whereas hESC-MSCs were not only engrafted in injured pulmonary arteries but had also undergone endothelial differentiation . In addition , protein profiling of hESC-MSC- and BM-MSC-conditioned medium revealed a differential paracrine capacity . Classification of these factors into bioprocesses revealed that secreted factors from hESC-MSCs were preferentially involved in early embryonic development and tissue differentiation , especially blood vessel morphogenesis . We concluded that improved cell survival and paracrine capacity of hESC-MSCs provide better therapeutic efficacy than BM-MSCs in the treatment for PAH; ARTICLE 2: Abstract We investigated the effect of adipose-derived stem cells ( ADSCs ) transplantation effects on structural remodeling and pulmonary artery pressure in  monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary hypertensive rats . In the first experiment , 32 male Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) rats were r and omly divided into four groups ( n = 8/group ) : 3 ADSCs treated groups and normal control ( Ctrl ) . ADSCs were administered through the left jugular vein at 105 , 106 and 107 cells , respectively , and a cell density of 106cells/ml was shown to be optimal . The GFP-tagged ADSCs were identified in the lungs and differentiated into endothelial-like cells . In the second experiment , 96 male SD rats were r and omly divided into three groups ( n = 32/group ) : Ctrl , MCT-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , and PAH treated with ADSCs ( ADSCs ) . Two weeks post-MCT administration , the ADSCs group received 1 × 106 ADSCs via the external jugular vein . Compared to PAH rats , mean pulmonary arterial pressure was decreased in rats at 1 , 2 , and 3 weeks after ADSCs-treatment ( 18.63 ± 2.15 mmHg versus 24.53 ± 2.90 mmHg ; 23.07 ± 2.84 mmHg versus 33.18 ± 2.30 mmHg ; 22.98 ± 2.34 mmHg versus 36.38 ± 3.28 mmHg , p < 0.05 ) . Meanwhile , the right heart hypertrophy index ( 36.2 1 ± 4.27 % versus 41.01 ± 1.29 % ; 39.47 ± 4.02 % versus 48.75 ± 2 .13 % ; 41.02 ± 0.9 % versus 50.52 ± 1.49 % , p < 0.05 , respectively ) , ratio of wall/lumen thickness , as well as the wall/lumen area were significantly reduced in PAH rats at these time points following ADSCs-treatment , as compared with untreated PAH rats . In summary , ADSCs may colonize the pulmonary arteries , attenuate pulmonary arterial hypertension and ameliorate pulmonary arterial remodeling; ARTICLE 3: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell ( BMSC ) transp1antation on lung and heart damage in a rat model of monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . The animals were r and omly divided into 3 groups : control , PAH  and  BMSC implantation  groups . Structural changes in the pulmonary vascular wall , such as the pulmonary artery lumen area ( VA ) and vascular area ( TAA ) were measured by hematoxylin and eosin ( H&E ) staining , and the hemodynamics were detected by echocardiography . Two weeks post-operation , our results demonstrated that sublingual vein injection of BMSCs significantly attenuated the pulmonary vascular structural and hemodynamic changes caused by pulmonary arterial hypertension . The mechanism may be executed via paracrine effects; ARTICLE 4: OBJECTIVE To characterize mortality in persons diagnosed with primary pulmonary hypertension and to investigate factors associated with survival . DESIGN Registry with prospect i ve follow-up . SETTING Thirty-two clinical centers in the United States participating in the Patient Registry for the Characterization of Primary Pulmonary Hypertension supported by the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute . PATIENTS Patients ( 194 ) diagnosed at clinical centers between 1 July 1981 and 31 December 1985 and followed through 8 August 1988 . MEASUREMENTS At diagnosis , measurements of hemodynamic variables , pulmonary function , and gas exchange variables were taken in addition to information on demographic variables , medical history , and life-style . Patients were followed for survival at 6-month intervals . MAIN RESULTS The estimated median survival of these patients was 2.8 years ( 95 % Cl , 1.9 to 3.7 years ) . Estimated single-year survival rates were as follows : at 1 year , 68 % ( Cl , 61 % to 75 % ) ; at 3 years , 48 % ( Cl , 41 % to 55 % ) ; and at 5 years , 34 % ( Cl , 24 % to 44 % ) . Variables associated with poor survival included a New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional class of III or IV , presence of Raynaud phenomenon , elevated mean right atrial pressure , elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure , decreased cardiac index , and decreased diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) . Drug therapy at entry or discharge was not associated with survival duration . CONCLUSIONS Mortality was most closely associated with right ventricular hemodynamic function and can be characterized by means of an equation using three variables : mean pulmonary artery pressure , mean right atrial pressure , and cardiac index . Such an equation , once vali date d prospect ively , could be used as an adjunct in planning treatment strategies and allocating medical re sources; ARTICLE 5: BACKGROUND Sildenafil inhibits phosphodiesterase type 5 , an enzyme that metabolizes cyclic guanosine monophosphate , thereby enhancing the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-mediated relaxation and growth inhibition of vascular smooth-muscle cells , including those in the lung . METHODS In this double-blind , placebo-controlled study , we r and omly assigned 278 patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension ( either idiopathic or associated with connective-tissue disease or with repaired congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts ) to placebo or sildenafil  ( 20 , 40 , or 80 mg ) orally three times daily for 12 weeks . The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 12 in the distance walked in six minutes . The change in mean pulmonary-artery pressure and World Health Organization ( WHO ) functional class and the incidence of clinical worsening were also assessed , but the study was not powered to assess mortality . Patients completing the 12-week r and omized study could enter a long-term extension study . RESULTS The distance walked in six minutes increased from baseline in all sildenafil groups ; the mean placebo-corrected treatment effects were 45 m ( + 13.0 percent ) , 46 m ( + 13.3 percent ) , and 50 m ( + 14.7 percent ) for 20 , 40 , and 80 mg of sildenafil , respectively ( P<0.001 for all comparisons ) . All sildenafil doses reduced the mean pulmonary-artery pressure ( P=0.04 , P=0.01 , and P<0.001 , respectively ) , improved the WHO functional class ( P=0.003 , P<0.001 , and P<0.001 , respectively ) , and were associated with side effects such as flushing , dyspepsia , and diarrhea . The incidence of clinical worsening did not differ significantly between the patients treated with sildenafil and those treated with placebo . Among the 222 patients completing one year of treatment with sildenafil monotherapy , the improvement from baseline at one year in the distance walked in six minutes was 51 m. CONCLUSIONS Sildenafil improves exercise capacity , WHO functional class , and hemodynamics in patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension; ARTICLE 6: BACKGROUND Current therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension have been adopted on the basis of short-term trials with exercise capacity as the primary end point . We assessed the efficacy of macitentan , a new dual endothelin-receptor antagonist , using a primary end point of morbidity and mortality in a long-term trial . METHODS We r and omly assigned patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension to receive placebo once daily , macitentan at a once-daily dose of 3 mg , or macitentan at a once-daily dose of 10 mg . Stable use of oral or inhaled therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension , other than endothelin-receptor antagonists , was allowed at study entry . The primary end point was the time from the initiation of treatment to the first occurrence of a composite end point of death , atrial septostomy , lung transplantation , initiation of treatment with intravenous or subcutaneous prostanoids , or worsening of pulmonary arterial hypertension . RESULTS A total of 250 patients were r and omly assigned to placebo , 250 to the 3-mg macitentan dose , and 242 to the 10-mg macitentan dose . The primary end point occurred in 46.4 % , 38.0 % , and 31.4 % of the patients in these groups , respectively . The hazard ratio for the 3-mg macitentan dose as compared with placebo was 0.70 ( 97.5 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.52 to 0.96 ; P=0.01 ) , and the hazard ratio for the 10-mg macitentan dose as compared with placebo was 0.55 ( 97.5 % CI , 0.39 to 0.76 ; P<0.001 ) . Worsening of pulmonary arterial hypertension was the most frequent primary end-point event . The effect of macitentan on this end point was observed regardless of whether the patient was receiving therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension at baseline . Adverse events more frequently associated with macitentan than with placebo were headache , nasopharyngitis , and anemia . CONCLUSIONS Macitentan significantly reduced morbidity and mortality among patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension in this event-driven study . ( Funded by Actelion Pharmaceuticals ; SERAPHIN Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00660179 . ); ARTICLE 7: Our previous studies have shown that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSCs ) can inhibit the progression of pulmonary artery hypertension ( PAH ) in the monocrotaline ( MCT ) model in the short term . The aim of this study was to further investigate the long-term effect of BMSCs on PAH and to explore the mechanism of the protective effect including the pulmonary vascular remodeling and cell differentiation . PAH model was established by subcutaneous injection of 50 mg/kg MCT as previously study . Postoperatively , the animals were r and omly divided into three groups ( n = 10 in each group ) : control , PAH group , and BMSCs implantation group . Six months after injection , immunology and immunohistochemistry analysis indicated the  MCT-induced intima-media thickness in muscular arteries was reduced ( P < 0.05 ) ; the area of collagen fibers in lung tissue was lower ( P < 0.05 ) , and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen level in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells was decreased ( P < 0.05 ) . Immunofluorescence showed that the cells have the ability to differentiate between von Willebr and factor and vascular endothelial growth factor . Six months after intravenous injection , BMSCs could significantly improve pulmonary function by inhibiting the ventricular remodeling and the effect of cell differentiation; ARTICLE 8: Experimental data suggest that transplantation of EPCs attenuates monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats and dogs . In addition , our previous studies suggested that autologous EPC transplantation was feasible , safe , and might have beneficial effects on exercise capacity and pulmonary hemodynamics in adults with IPAH . Thus , we hypothesized that transplantation of EPCs would improve exercise capacity and pulmonary hemodynamics in children with IPAH . Thirteen children with IPAH received intravenous infusion of autologous EPCs . The right-sided heart catheterization and 6-MWD test were performed at baseline and at the time of 12 wk after cell infusion . At the time of 12 wk , mPAP decreased by 6.4 mmHg from 70.3 + /- 19.0 to 63.9 + /- 19.3 mmHg ( p = 0.015 ) . PVR decreased by approximately 19 % from 1118 + /- 537 to 906 + /- 377 dyn s/cm(5 ) ( p = 0.047 ) . CO increased from 3.39 + /- 0.79 to 3.85 + /- 0.42 L/min ( p = 0.048 ) . The 6-MWD increased by 39 m from 359 + /- 82 to 399 + /- 74 m ( p = 0.012 ) . NYHA functional class also improved . There were no severe adverse events with cell infusion . The small pilot study suggested that intravenous infusion of autologous EPCs was feasible , safe , and associated with significant improvements in exercise capacity , NYHA functional class , and pulmonary hemodynamics in children with IPAH . Confirmation of these results in a r and omized controlled trial are essential; ARTICLE 9: BACKGROUND Uncontrolled studies suggested that aerosolized iloprost , a stable analogue of prostacyclin , causes selective pulmonary vasodilatation and improves hemodynamics and exercise capacity in patients with pulmonary hypertension . METHODS We compared repeated daily inhalations of 2.5 or 5.0 microg of iloprost ( six or nine times per day ; median inhaled dose , 30 microg per day ) with inhalation of placebo .  A total of 203 patients with selected forms of severe pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] functional class III or IV ) were included . The primary end point was met if , after week 12 , the NYHA class and distance walked in six minutes were improved by at least one class and at least 10 percent , respectively , in the absence of clinical deterioration according to predefined criteria and death . RESULTS The combined clinical end point was met by 16.8 percent of the patients receiving iloprost , as compared with 4.9 percent of the patients receiving placebo ( P=0.007 ) . There were increases in the distance walked in six minutes of 36.4 m in the iloprost group as a whole ( P=0.004 ) and of 58.8 m in the subgroup of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension . Overall , 4.0 percent of patients in the iloprost group ( including one who died ) and 13.7 percent of those in the placebo group ( including four who died ) did not complete the study ( P=0.024 ) ; the most common reason for withdrawal was clinical deterioration . As compared with base-line values , hemodynamic values were significantly improved at 12 weeks when measured after iloprost inhalation ( P<0.001 ) , were largely unchanged when measured before iloprost inhalation , and were significantly worse in the placebo group . Further significant beneficial effects of iloprost treatment included an improvement in the NYHA class ( P=0.03 ) , dyspnea ( P=0.015 ) , and quality of life ( P=0.026 ) . Syncope occurred with similar frequency in the two groups but was more frequently rated as serious in the iloprost group , although this adverse effect was not associated with clinical deterioration . CONCLUSIONS Inhaled iloprost is an effective therapy for patients with severe pulmonary hypertension; ARTICLE 10: BACKGROUND High pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) may be a risk factor for early and late mortality in both Glen shunt and Fontan operation patients . Furthermore , PVR may increase long after the Fontan operation . Whether pulmonary vasodilators such as phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors can decrease PVR in patients with single ventricular physiology remains undetermined . METHODS AND RESULTS This was a prospect i ve , multicenter study . Patients with single ventricular physiology who have a PVR index higher than 2.5 Wood units · ㎡ ( WU ) were enrolled .  Cardiac catheterization was performed before and after administration of sildenafil in all patients . After the Fontan operation , a  six minute walk test  ( 6MWT ) was also performed . A total of 42 patients were enrolled . PVR was significantly decreased in each stage of single ventricular physiology after sildenafil administration : from 4.3±1.5WU to 2.1±0.6WU ( p<0.01 ) in patients before a Glenn shunt , from 3.2±0.5WU to 1.6±0.6WU ( p<0.001 ) in patients after a Glenn shunt , and from 3.9±1.7WU to 2.3±0.8WU ( p<0.001 ) in patients after Fontan . In patients after Fontan , the 6MWT increased from 416±74 m to 485±72 m ( p<0.01 ) , and NYHA functional class improved significantly ( p<0.05 ) after sildenafil administration . No major side effects were observed in any patients . CONCLUSIONS Sildenafil reduced PVR in patients with single ventricle physiology . Sildenafil increased exercise capacity and improved NYHA functional class in patients after a Fontan operation . This implies that pulmonary vasodilation is a potential therapeutic target in selected patients with elevated PVR with single ventricle physiology . Long-term clinical significance warrants further study; ARTICLE 11: OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of four doses of ambrisentan , an oral endothelin type A receptor-selective antagonist , in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . BACKGROUND Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a life-threatening and progressive disease with limited treatment options . Endothelin is a vasoconstrictor and smooth muscle cell mitogen that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of PAH . METHODS In this double-blind , dose-ranging study , 64 patients with idiopathic PAH or PAH associated with collagen vascular disease , anorexigen use , or human immunodeficiency virus infection were r and omized to receive 1 , 2.5 , 5 , or 10 mg of ambrisentan once daily for 12 weeks followed by 12 weeks of open-label ambrisentan . The primary end point was an improvement from baseline in 6-min walk distance ( 6MWD ) ; secondary end points included Borg dyspnea index , World Health Organization ( WHO ) functional class , a subject global assessment , and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics . RESULTS At 12 weeks , ambrisentan increased 6MWD ( + 36.1 m , p < 0.0001 ) with similar and statistically significant increases for each dose group ( range , + 33.9 to + 38.1 m ) . Improvements were also observed in Borg dyspnea index , WHO functional class , subject global assessment , mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( -5.2 mm Hg , p < 0.0001 ) , and cardiac index ( + 0.33 l/min/m2 , p < 0.0008 ) . Adverse events were mild and unrelated to dose , including the incidence of elevated serum aminotransferase concentrations > 3 times the upper limit of normal ( 3.1 % ) . CONCLUSIONS Ambrisentan appears to improve exercise capacity , symptoms , and hemodynamics in patients with PAH . The incidence and severity of liver enzyme abnormalities appear to be low; ARTICLE 12: UNLABELLED Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) is characterized by functional and structural changes in the pulmonary vasculature , and despite the drug treatment that made significant progress , the prognosis of patients with advanced PH remains extremely poor . In the present study , we investigated the early effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSCs ) on experimental high blood flow-induced PAH model rats and discussed the mechanism . BMSCs were isolated , cultured from bone marrow of Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) rat . The animal model of PAH was created by surgical methods to produce a left-to-right shunt . Following the successful establishment of the PAH model , rats were r and omly assigned to three groups ( n=20 in each group ) : sham group ( control ) , PAH group , and BMSC group ( received a sublingual vein injection of 1 - 5 × 10(6 ) BMSCs ) . Two weeks after the administration , BMSCs significantly reduced the vascular remodeling , improved the hemodynamic data , and deceased the right ventricle weight ratio to left ventricular plus septal weight ( RV/LV+S ) ( P<0.05 ) . Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and immunohistochemistry analysis results indicated that the inflammation factors such as interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ) , IL-6 , and tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) were reduced ( P<0.05 ) ; the expression of matrix metallo proteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) was lower ( P<0.05 ) ; vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) was higher in BMSC group than those in PAH group ( P<0.05 ) . CONCLUSION Sublingual vein injection of BMSCs for 2 weeks , significantly improved the lung and heart injury caused by left-to-right shunt-induced PAH ; decreased pulmonary vascular remodeling and inflammation ; and enhanced angiogenesis; ARTICLE 13: Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a life-threatening disease for which continuous intravenous prostacyclin has proven to be effective . However , this treatment requires a permanent central venous catheter with the associated risk of serious complications such as sepsis , thromboembolism , or syncope . Treprostinil , a stable prostacyclin analogue , can be administered by a continuous subcutaneous infusion , avoiding these risks . We conducted a 12-week , double-blind , placebo-controlled multicenter trial in 470 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension , either primary or associated with connective tissue disease or congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts .  Exercise capacity improved with treprostinil and was unchanged with placebo ; the between treatment group difference in median six-minute walking distance was 16 m ( p = 0.006 ) . Improvement in exercise capacity was greater in the sicker patients and was dose-related , but independent of disease etiology . Concomitantly , treprostinil significantly improved indices of dyspnea , signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension , and hemodynamics . The most common side effect attributed to treprostinil was infusion site pain ( 85 % ) leading to premature discontinuation from the study in 8 % of patients . Three patients in the treprostinil treatment group presented with an episode of gastrointestinal hemorrhage . We conclude that chronic subcutaneous infusion of treprostinil is an effective treatment with an acceptable safety profile in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension; ARTICLE 14: BACKGROUND Endothelin 1 , a powerful endogenous vasoconstrictor and mitogen , might be a cause of pulmonary hypertension . We describe the efficacy and safety of bosentan , a dual endothelin-receptor antagonist that can be taken orally , in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension . METHODS In this double-blind , placebo-controlled study , 32 patients with pulmonary hypertension ( primary or associated with scleroderma ) were r and omly assigned to bosentan ( 62.5 mg taken twice daily for 4 weeks then 125 mg twice daily ) or placebo for a minimum of 12 weeks . The primary endpoint was change in exercise capacity . Secondary endpoints included changes in cardiopulmonary haemodynamics , Borg dyspnoea index , WHO functional class , and withdrawal due to clinical worsening . Analysis was by intention to treat . FINDINGS In patients given bosentan , the distance walked in 6 min improved by 70 m at 12 weeks compared with baseline , whereas it worsened by 6 m in those on placebo ( difference 76 m [ 95 % CI 12 - 139 ] , p=0.021 ) . The improvement was maintained for at least 20 weeks . The cardiac index was 1.0 L min(-1 ) m(-2 ) ( 95 % CI 0.6 - 1.4 , p<0.0001 ) greater in patients given bosentan than in those given placebo .  Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased by 223 dyn s cm(-)(5 ) with bosentan , but increased by 191 dyn s cm(-5 ) with placebo ( difference -415 [ -608 to -221 ] , p=0.0002 ) . Patients given bosentan had a reduced Borg dyspnoea index and an improved WHO functional class . All three withdrawals from clinical worsening were in the placebo group ( p=0.033 ) . The number and nature of adverse events did not differ between the two groups . INTERPRETATION Bosentan increases exercise capacity and improves haemodynamics in patients with pulmonary hypertension , suggesting that endothelin has an important role in pulmonary hypertension; ARTICLE 15: Background Systematic Review s ( SRs ) of experimental animal studies are not yet common practice , but awareness of the merits of conducting such SRs is steadily increasing . As animal intervention studies differ from r and omized clinical trials ( RCT ) in many aspects , the methodology for SRs of clinical trials needs to be adapted and optimized for animal intervention studies . The Cochrane Collaboration developed a Risk of Bias ( RoB ) tool to establish consistency and avoid discrepancies in assessing the method ological quality of RCTs . A similar initiative is warranted in the field of animal experimentation . Methods We provide an RoB tool for animal intervention studies ( SYRCLE ’s RoB tool ) . This tool is based on the Cochrane RoB tool and has been adjusted for aspects of bias that play a specific role in animal intervention studies . To enhance transparency and applicability , we formulated signalling questions to facilitate judgment . Results The result ing RoB tool  for animal studies contains 10 entries . These entries are related to selection bias , performance bias , detection bias , attrition bias , reporting bias and other biases . Half these items are in agreement with the items in the Cochrane RoB tool . Most of the variations between the two tools are due to differences in design between RCTs and animal studies . Shortcomings in , or unfamiliarity with , specific aspects of experimental design of animal studies compared to clinical studies also play a role . Conclusions SYRCLE ’s RoB tool is an adapted version of the Cochrane RoB tool . Widespread adoption and implementation of this tool will facilitate and improve critical appraisal of evidence from animal studies . This may subsequently enhance the efficiency of translating animal research into clinical practice and increase awareness of the necessity of improving the method ological quality of animal studies'"
