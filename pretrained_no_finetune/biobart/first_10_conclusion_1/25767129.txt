Retrieve concise conclusion without background: BACKGROUND : The efficacy of varenicline is a novel treatment for smoking cessation.  Varenicline, a partial agonist at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, may be more acceptable to smokers. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of varenicline versus placebo in smoking cessation in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Methods : In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial, subjects were r and omized to receive varenicline or placebo.  Both groups received in-hospital and telephone counseling.. The primary outcome was the 7-day point prevalence abstinence rate 12 weeks after cessation. Secondary outcomes included abstinence at 3 and 6 months after treatment. : The primary end point was carbon monoxide - confirmed continuous abstinence rate for weeks 9 through 12 ( n = 130 ). The varenicline doses in the high-body-weight group were 1 mg BID and 0.5 mg BID. The placebo group were similar at baseline, those treated with varenicline were significantly less likely to report adverse events.. At 12 weeks ( end of treatment ), the varenicline group was significantly higher for varenicline than placebo. At the 6-month postquit follow-up visit, there was no significant difference between varenicline and placebo. The mean ( SD ) number of varenicline treated subjects was 64.3 % ( varenicline ) versus 40.6 % ( placebo ), and the mean abstinence rates were significantly higher ( p =.006 ), while there were no significant differences in varenicline-treated subjects. The adverse events were similar between groups, with no significant changes in placebo compared with placebo.. KEY MESSAGES : : Varenicline was well tolerated with no serious adverse events in any group...A}).+VC)/-RÂ -. and].,
