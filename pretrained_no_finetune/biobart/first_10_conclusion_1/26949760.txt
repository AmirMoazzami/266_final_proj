Retrieve concise conclusion without background: OBJECTIVES The aim of this prospect i ve clinical study was to evaluate the clinical performance of three-unit zirconia fixed dental prostheses ( FDPs ) made  from a lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic ( IPS e.max Press, Ivoclar Vivadent ). MATERIAL S AND METHODS Forty-three patients were placed in 19 patients ( mean age, 34 Â± 9.6 years ; 15 male, 26 female ). The inlays were placed with three 3-step and one 2-step etch and rinse bonding. The restorations were evaluated by two calibrated investigators. The survival rate was evaluated after 6 months, and 1 to 5 years after cementation. The outcomes were compared between restored crowns and contralateral teeth using a t-test. RESULTS Eight of the 96 restorations had to be replaced ( failure rate 16 % ), and 7.1 % presented marginal discoloration. The clinical reevaluations were performed using the chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, the survival rate and complication rates of  all-ceramic restorations after a minimum follow-up time of 5 years.
