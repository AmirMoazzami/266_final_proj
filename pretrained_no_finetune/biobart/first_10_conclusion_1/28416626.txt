Retrieve concise conclusion without background: OBJECT Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( ICH ) is a rare but potentially devastating complication of oral anticoagulation ( OAC ).  Heparin is a pleiotropic drug that antagonizes many of the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in secondary brain injury after aSAH.. The authors performed a retrospective analysis in 86 consecutive patients with Fisher Grade 3 aSAH due to rupture of a supratentorial aneurysm who presented within 36 hours and were treated by surgical clipping within 48 hours of their ictus. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients discharged from our institution after OAC-associated ICH over a 10-year period. Data on the use of OAC or platelet inhibitors and the occurrence of vascular events during follow-up were assessed through question naires and patient files. The primary outcome was recurrent fatal or non-fatal stroke. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of other haemorrhagic, thrombotic or thromboembolic events. With patients without antithrombotic treatment as reference. In the heparin group, activated partial thromboplastin times were normal to mildly elevated.. Factors associated with favorable ( modified Rankin Scale score, 0 - 3 ) vs unfavorable functional outcome. RESULTS Hemorrhage enlargement occurred in 307 of 853 patients ( 36.0 % ). The overall risk of a thrombus formation were associated with reversal of INR levels < 1.3 within 4 hours after admission ( 43/217 [ 19.8 % ] ) vs INR of ≥1.3 ( 264/636 [ 41.5 % ] and 3.32 [ 1-year, P = 0.003 ] ). We saw recurrent intracranial bleeding in eight patients, 2 of which were fatal. We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to summarize the outcomes of OAC, including the risk of ICH recurrence ( P < 0.001 ).. In patients with ICH, the frequency of ICH ( INR therapy after the onset of ICH ) remain unclear. The safety and efficacy of restarting the OAC after ICH. ).
