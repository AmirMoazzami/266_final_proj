Retrieve concise conclusion without background: OBJECTIVE To identify determinants of sexual adjustment by persons with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) and quality of the relationship compared with persons in the general population. DESIGN Controlled survey. SETTING Postdischarge community setting. PARTICIPANTS A consecutive series of 252 persons admitted to our spinal unit between November 1982 and July 1991 with traumatic SCI were contacted, 85 of whom persons were excluded : 36 were dead, 37 had recovered, 5 could not be located, 4 were younger than 18 years, 2 had language difficulties, and 1 had a psychiatric illness. Of the remaining 167 persons with SCI, 85 had a stable partner relationship, 75 of whom ( 88 % ) completed and returned the question naires ( median age, 33 years ; range 19 to 76 ). Correlation analysis evaluated criterion validation. Change scores compared to change scores in other measures evaluated responsiveness among women who underwent surgery. Results A total of 589 women gave baseline data, 200 returned surveys after treatment, and 147 provided test-retest data. For SA women, 3 subscales each in 2 domains ( 21 items ) and for NSA women 2 subscales in each of 2 domains together with a partner. Sexual information and counselling should be available both during initial rehabilitation and later when the women have returned to their homes. The most important correlates for sexual fulfillment in both groups were found to be the use of a varied repertoire of sexual behaviors and the perceived treatment ( SGI ; 1, terrible ; 7, delighted ). CONCLUSIONS To systematic ally review which vali date d PROMs are available to evaluate sexual function. The quality ofÂ the PROMs that can be used for neurologic patients remains unknown. OBJECTIVE To systematically ally the quality of a satisfying sexual function in neurologic patients and to critically assess the quantity of sexual function among neurologic patients.
