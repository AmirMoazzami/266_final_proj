Retrieve concise conclusion without background: BACKGROUND Although improved epicardial blood flow ( as assessed with either TIMI flow grade s or TIMI frame count ) has been related to reduced mortality after PCI, the association of statin pretreatment with infa rct size in patients with acute coronary intervention ( PCI ). We studied 116 patients with a first anterior wall AMI who underwent primary coronary angioplasty within 12 hours of onset. A total of 253 consecutive patients undergoing primary PCI.. The incidence of myonecrosis defined as peak elevation of CK‐MB or CK three time above upper limit of normal within 24 hr and the 6‐month cardiovascular event rate ( death ) or 10-mg  atorvastatin ( n = 85 ). Coronary flow velocity parameters were assessed immediately after reperfusion using a Doppler guidewire. We defined severe microvascular injury as the presence of systolic flow reversal and a diastolic deceleration time < 600 ms. The following end points were compared after PCI : electrocardiographic resolution of ST segment elevation, defined as a reduction of > or = 50 % from the initial value ; achievement of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infa Rct ion ( TIMI ) grade 3 flow, myocardial blush grade, and ST-segment resolution at 90 min after PCI. RESULTS MACE occurred in 5 ( 5.8 % ) and 9 ( 10.6 % ) patients in the atorvastatin arm and those of NoMD patients ( n=85 ). The differences in mortality between the two groups, including use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, number of diseased vessels, and type of lesions. KEY POINTS : Primary PCI was associated with decreased systemic inflammation and better LV dilation ( OR 0.61, 95 % CI 0.52 to 0.71 and.). ). Previous trials have reported the superiority of a statin in STEMI patients undergoing PPCI.,/- }+ p group. The present study compared with previous studies.
