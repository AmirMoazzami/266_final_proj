Retrieve concise conclusion without background: INTRODUCTION Tobacco use in low- to middle-income countries is a major public health concern for both smokers and those exposed to environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ). The analysis was split into two halves â€“ baseline study taken up prior to implementation of the said ban on 2nd October 2008, and the follow-up study after it came into effect. Material s and Methods : Twenty-five venues including five restaurants, fourteen resto-bars, two hookah ( smoking water-pipe ) cafes and four pubs were selected using a mix of r and om, convenience and purpose ful sampling. Particulate matter ( PM2.5 ) measurements at these venues were made using TSI SidePak AM510 Personal Aerosol Monitor. The primary endpoint was continuous 6-month smoking abstinence, which was determined by carbon monoxide levels. In order to underst and reasons for non-permission, interviews with parents were conducted. Phone numbers of parents were requested from the school administration.. Secondary end points were 7 day point-prevalent abstinence and adherence to treatment. A rand om sample of 28 parents from 12 schools was interviewed to reach data saturation. In a meta- analysis, higher odds of waterpipe tobacco smoking were found among males ( Adjusted odds ratio [ AOR ] = 1.37, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] =1.18 % to 1.57 ).. The intervention did not result in reductions in cigarette smoking. However, the tailored Web intervention predicted the effectiveness of smoking cessation. A similar pattern was observed for cigarette-only smokers at baseline ( RR = 1 vs. 1.54. 95 % CI = 0.9, 1.82 ). We systematic ally review the literature, EMBASE and Web of Science, for interventions targeting prevention and cessation to smoke the smoking.
