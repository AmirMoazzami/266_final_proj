Retrieve concise conclusion without background: BACKGROUND : Postoperative hyperglycemia is associated with postoperative insulin resistance. We studied the effect of a preoperative carbohydrate loading. The effect of this treatment on postoperative recovery. The study was conducted to determine the role of preoperative carbohydrate administration and the impact on postoperative insulin sensitivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS Insulin resistance and glucose turnover ( [ 6, 6,(2)H(2)]-D-glucose ) were measured using a carbohydrate-rich drink ( 400 ml ). The patients undergoing a hepatectomy for the treatment of a hepatic neoplasm were recruited to this double-blind study. The gastric volume and pH immediately following the induction of general anaesthesia were recorded. The postoperative blood glucose level was determined to calculate the postoperative insulin, gastric emptying, and there were no adverse events. The visual analog scale scores in a control group were not different between groups. During the waiting period before surgery, the CHO-treated group was less hungry and less anxious than both the other groups ( P ≤ 0.05 ). There were no differences between these groups with respect to age, sex, procedure, admission time, insulin resistance, or postoperative complications.. The carbohydrate group was significantly lower than the control group ( P < 0.0001... ). The volume gastrique était de 0.43 ± 0.5 and 9.3 ± 1.9 mg/kg/min, respectively. At dischargeA+.
