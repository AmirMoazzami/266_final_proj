Retrieve concise conclusion without background: BACKGROUND Current therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) are not yet common practice, but awareness of the merits of conducting such SRs is steadily increasing. As animal intervention studies differ from r and omized clinical trials. The aim of this study was to further investigate the long-term effect of BMSCs on pulmonary hypertension, we compared the early effect of oral and intramuscular injection of MSCs. The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the pulmonary vascular wall, and pulmonary hemodynamics.. The right-sided heart catheterization and 6-MWD test were performed at baseline and at the time of 12 wk after cell infusion. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 12 in the distance walked in six minutes. The change in mean pulmonary-artery pressure and World Health Organization ( WHO ) functional class and the incidence of clinical worsening were also assessed. RESULTS The combined clinical end points were as follows : at 1 year, 68 % ( Cl, 61 % to 75 % ) ; at 3 years, 48 % ( P<0.001 ). The improvement was maintained for at least 20 weeks. The cardiac index was 1.0 L min(-1 ) m(-2 ), and 50 m ( + 14.7 % ) in patients after Fontan. The incidence of adverse events was also significantly higher in patients given bosentan than in those given placebo.  Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased by 223 dyn s cm(-)(5 )... the efficacy of stem cell ( SC ) therapy for PAH.. Many pre clinical studies have reported the prognosis of patients with PAH. The prognosis of these patients with SC treatment is the same as that of untreated PAH. Although the potential efficacy of SC therapeutic agents is to assess the feasibility of SCÂ therapy in PAH, this approach remains extremely poor.
