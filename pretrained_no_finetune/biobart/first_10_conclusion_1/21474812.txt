Retrieve concise conclusion without background: Background and Purpose : To develop a model for predicting outcome in the first week after acute ischemic stroke. The role of clinical characteristics in predicting outcomes of patients with acute stroke is not robust. The combination of clinical and imaging variables as predictors of outcome after the acute phase of stroke. We aim to determine the predictive value of the outcome of patients assessed within 6 hours of onset. The study was therefore conducted in a cohort study. Patients with stroke patients were prospectively enrolled to the study. The outcome was assessed at 7 days and 3 months after stroke. In all patients, the initial degree of paralysis ( BI ) and the Glasgow Coma Scale ( GOS ). The six variables were collected at r and omisation. The predictive model based on these factors predicted functional outcome with an overall accuracy of 67 % and mortality with an accuracy of 83 %. The final models of binary logistic regression analyses were constructed. The baseline NIHSS score was the most important predictor for outcome. The cohort study showed that the cohort study predicted outcome, with one additional point on the RIHSS. The outcomes of interest were the following: the baseline BI. The logistic regression model was developed to predict the outcomes. The accuracy of this model was assessed for the 6-month follow-up. The prognostic factors that predict outcome of stroke patients that are the same ( p = 0.001 ). The model predicts the early poststroke phase for outcome of ADL.. The model is a valid tool for predicting outcomes after stroke patients. A score of â‰¥16 forecasts a high probability of recovery or even complete recovery. The score of 6-months after stroke is predictive or not predictive. The classification of outcomes of stroke with the model.A+RC/)-90,). and.
