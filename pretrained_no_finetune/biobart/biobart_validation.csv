26762372," Background : The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of lutein and carotenoids ( β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, and other antioxidants ) on cardiometabolic outcomes. OBJECTIVE We examined the association between plasma lutein-fortified infant formula  with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.. The study was a prospect i ve cohort of 259 healthy premenopausal women.. During a mean follow-up of 2.1 y, we identified 499 cases of CVD ( confirmed myocardial infa rct ion, stroke, and sex hormone-binding globulin ( SHBG ) ). Baseline plasma levels of lycopene, alpha-tocopherol, and tocotrienols were measured in a r and omised, double-blind, placebo-controlled  trial. We tested the hypotheses that increased dietary carotenoid intake enhances immunocompetence in male zebra finches... Serum lutein concentrations increased significantly from 0.34 to 1.96 μmol/l in the lutein group ( P < 0.001 ).. In these intervention studies, the mean values of serum lutein and zeaxanthin were similar between the highest versus the lowest quartile of plasma retinol ( P for trend=0.82 ), and increased cell-mediated and humoral immune responses than did controls.. Cell-mediated responses were predicted directly by changes in serum lutein ( 95 % CI : −0.28, 0.98 ). The mean plasma concentrations of vitamin C were more than doubled during the study period ( P = 0.03 ). There was no evidence of an interaction between PAHs and micronutrients, although power was limited. CONCLUSIONS The antioxidant lutein is suggested as being beneficial to cardiovascular health because of its protective effect against oxidative stress.. Although not statistically significant, the antioxidant lutein was suggested to have a protective effect on the development of type II diabetes.A."
28723736," BACKGROUND Surgical site infections ( SSIs ) following total hip arthroplasty can lead to prolonged hospitalization, increased morbidity and mortality, and high costs. This article analyzes the effect of various parameters of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis on the risk of surgical-wound infection. Methods From July 1, 2003 to June 30, 2004 we conducted a prospect i ve cohort study in eight hospitals in Thail and. We used the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance ( NNIS ) system criteria to identify SSI associated with appendectomy. The association between the prophylaxis timing and the occurrence of SSI.  Urinary tract infection developed more frequently in the 2 day group ( 17.0 versus 8.5 per cent ), particularly during the first 6 postoperative days... The type of antibiotic prophylaxis was considered proper if it was administered within 30 min prior to incision, while it was detectable in 86 % and 38 % of patients who received cefoxitin sodium with anesthesia and on call, respectively.. Because cefoxitin has a much shorter elimination half-life than cefazolin, the infection risk following administration of antibiotic within 30 minutes before surgery was significantly associated with an increased SSI risk. Of 11,282 patients, 452 had 1 or more health care-associated infections  ( 3.4 % ), compared with 15 patients given vancomycin between 0 and 15 min ( 26.7 % ). The most common diagnoses were cancer ( 38.8 % ) and inflammatory bowel disease ( 22.0 % ) ).. Intraoperative redosing ( performed in only 21 % of long operations ), and 54 ( 8.9 % ) had wound infections. The benefit of the antibiotic concentration at closure on SSI  and suggests the benefit of routine use of SAP prior the surgery. The effect of time of surgery on  surgical site infection ( SSI ) has long been recognized.. andA.).} "
22002191," BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : The purpose of this study was to determine whether the addition of incentive spirometry ( IS ) to postoperative pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery. We prospect to compare the effect on lung function tests of continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) and positive expiratory pressure ( PEP ) administered  by face mask  against those of a control  group using  a deep-breathing device ( Triflo ).  Forty-three consecutive, r and omized patients undergoing elective upper abdominal surgery were included.  CPAP, PEP and Triflo were administered for 30 consecutive breaths in every waking hour for three days. The patients in the control group was instructed to use the incentive spirometer for 3 breaths, once per day. The treatment groups had similar demographic characteristics, chest radiograph, white blood cell count, and number of hospital and intensive care unit days... The incidence of pulmonary function was significantly reduced after surgery ( 55 % of the preoperative value ), increasing to 2.32 1 by day 5. The mean arterial oxygen tension was 7.37 kPa, both before and after the operation. In group B, the predicted postoperative FEV1 value significantly decreased in all groups ( EC : 87.1 vs. 32.0 % ; IS : 75.3 vs. 29.5 % ; and BS : 81.9 vs. 33.2 % ; p < 0.001 for all ). Adding IS to regular PT did not reduce hospital or thoracic surgeries."
31921439," Background : Several established tools are available to assess the effect of high-intensity interval training ( HIIT ), to improve aerobic capacity and the cardiovascular risk profile in overweight and obese participants. The present study compared the effects of two HIIT, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or strength training on the health markers in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ). In the present study, a total of 40 subjects were r and omly assigned to three training groups ( 3x weekly ).. The two interventions, exercise training and maximal aerobic capacity ( VO2 ), were compared with an active  control group undertaking walking based exercise. Supervised group sessions ( 36 per intervention ) were held outdoors. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured using VO2max ( maximal oxygen uptake, results expressed in ml/min/kg ), and insulin resistance... Exercise enjoyment was measured by the vali date d Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale. Results : Exercise adherence ( 93.4 ± 3.1 % ) and exit ( N = 39 ). The risk of CVD decreased linearly with higher levels of exercise ( P < 0.001 ), but none of the training programs were effective in altering the plasma lipoproteins, total cholesterol, and LDL-C. The 84 subjects who complied with these guidelines served as the basis for the main analysis. All-extremity HIIT was feasible in older adults and result ed in no adverse events.. : Exercise training decreased resting mean arterial pressure ( P<0.0001 ) and triglycerides ( TRG ), while the exercise-induced increase in HDL-C ) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL- C )."
30301735," Background Topical glyceryl trinitrate ( GTN ) treatment has previously demonstrated short-term pain reduction in patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy. The mechanism of action is unknown but may be related to modulation of local nitric oxide levels. Methods The study was performed in western Sweden, in a region with 24 000 inhabitants. Data were collected during six months from electronic patient records at three primary healthcare centres in two municipalities. All patients between 20 and 64 years of age who presented with shoulder pain to a general practitioner or a physiotherapist were included. Diagnostic codes were used for selection, and the cases were manually controlled. The cost for pain relief was assessed using the visual analog scale ( VAS ) and treatment × time effect. The experimental group ( EG ) received transdermal treatment for 6 months in the form of a 1.25 mg nitroglycerine ( NT ) patch on the greater tubercle. In patients who showed a partial response, treatment was repeated up to 3 times at 15-day intervals. Pain was tested after 7 - 10 days of treatment. The mean healthcare cost per patient was not significant difference in any of the baseline clinical parameters. Mean Visual Analogue Scores pain scores during sports for both groups increased over the study period to 6.6±3 and 7.8±3.1. Results showed a significant effect for time ( p<0.01 ), decreased pain scores after the hop test at twenty-four weeks ( p = 0.005 ). Mean age was 61 years. In group A, complete improvement was seen in 19 patients and partial improvement in 3 ; treatment failed in 2 patients."
24752440," OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the effect of early exercise training intervention on bone mineralization and growth in preterm infants. We hypothesized that tactile/kinesthetic stimulation ( TKS ), a form of infant massage that incorporates kinesthetic movement, would increase bone strength and improve neurodevelopment. The study was conducted to compare the effects of a daily movement ( n=10 ) and control group ( CG, n=14 ). The PG group received passive range of motion with gentle compression of both the upper and lower extremities for 5 days per week for 4 weeks.. The two exercise groups completed three sets of the same nine exercises, three times a week. The intervention started at the first week of life and involved 8 weeks of daily passive extension and flexion range-of-motion exercise.. Bone strength was determined using quantitative ultrasound measurement of bone speed of sound ( BMC, g ), and density ( BMD, g/cm2 ). There was a significant difference in bone strength was measured weekly by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and bone resorption ( urine pyridinium crosslinks of collagen, Pyd )... After a similar nutrient intake at study entry, the mean bone SOS was greater in the control group compared to the intervention groups ( 0.6 % [ -0.2 to 1.4 ], p = 0.006 ). Serum calcium, phosphorus, and osteocalcin, there was no difference between the groups at 6 weeks of age. The mean bone mineral content of infants with the two groups ( 1.5 ± 0.9 versus 5.4 + /- 9.1 % in trained and control subjects, respectively ).Conclusion : A brief physical activity program administered by the infant's own mother is as effective as the rest of infants to promote bone mineralization or growth.. • Lack of physical stimulation may contribute to metabolic bone disease of preterm infants, particularly the low bone mass. and.. A combined exercise program may help to prevent bone mineralization of preterm calves/.). Physical activity programs combined with adequate nutrition might help the smallest infants with birth weight < 1000 g.•  Calcium and phosphorus intake may affect an infant ''s ability to recover or,). "
31731772," BACKGROUND Although increased consumption of soy protein has been shown to be the most efficacious in reducing body weight, little is known about the effects of soy products on body weight and the body mass index ( BMI ). This study compared the impacts of soy product on body composition and blood lipid profiles in overweight and obese postmenopausal women. Methods Sixty overweight men and women with BMI ≥23 kg/m2 and waist-hip-ratio ( WHR ) <0.90 for men and ≥0.85 for women were r and omly assigned to a soy supplement ( n=30 ) or placebo ( n = 30 ). The participants comprised a total of 237 overweight or obese males and females ( age 35 - 65 y ), and a control group. The baseline and after a 6-month treatment, we measured fasting glucose, insulin, waist circumference, fasting lipid profiles, insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ), comorbidities, and medication use. RESULTS There were 1,616 ( 19 % ) deaths over the 8-year period. The association of the soy product with weight, height, BMI, and muscle mass index  ( MMI ), the total protein intake of 1.3 ± 0.1 g/(kg · d ), or isoenergetic carbohydrate ( 25 g maltodextrin/supplement ). After the 12-week study, those with the greatest increase in intake of dietary fiber ( P = 0.05 ), had less weight ( OR = 1.32 ), body fat percentage, and abdominal fat percentage.. The effect of dietary supplementation with soy products was not significant, but the effect on weight and BMI were also significant ( p=0.017 ) and placebo to some extent. The study demonstrated that soy products can help them to lose weight."
29219090," Background To assess the effect of a governmentally-led physical activity program on child health, total body bone mineral content ( TB BMC ), and tibial cortical bone measures in preschool children. We conducted a single blinded cluster r and omized controlled trial in 58 children aged 3 - 5 years. The intervention comprised structured activities for children and their parents.. The control group participated in usual care activities. time spent in active and quiet play ; location and number of televisions... Children also were measured for height and weight, and accelerometer readings were obtained in a subset of children at 18 and 24 months ( 6 and 12 months post-intervention ). The Spearman correlation coefficients for mother-son pairs were calculated for each outcome. The third interface was the st and ard PubMed interface readily available on the Web.. Results The overall prevalence of overweight and obesity was 10.7 % and 4.2 %, respectively, and children born at term ( p = 0.02 ).. Both children in the intervention group were correlated with weight ( both, p < 0.001 ) and inversely correlated with age (.. the sum of seven skin-fold measurements, height, and weight explained 15.4 % of the variation in triglyceride levels.. There were no differences in children ’s average daily levels of physical activity and LPA. The majority of children were healthy.. Given the rapid development during the early years ( 0 - 4 years ), an underst and ing of these children's physical activity  were needed. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the relationships between objective ly and subjectively measured physical activity or to explore the health implication. The study suggests that a 29.6-wk school-based exercise program can prevent the development of obesity and related health indicators in children. The authors believe that the positive effects of treatment on children's nutritional status and the overall health indicators can be expected to be greater than the effects of a health intervention.."
29102433," Background : Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to be associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.  We examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation to subjects with prediabetes  in an interventional study.. Methods We r and omised 180 pregnant women at term ( > 37 weeks ’ gestation ). Main outcome measures Primary outcome was admission to hospital or death during the first six months of life. Secondary outcome was growth.. The frequency of errors associated with each method of data extraction was compared using the McNemar test. The data set for each method was used to calculate an efficacy estimate by each method, using st and ard meta-analytic techniques. The time requirement for the primary analysis, all participants enrolled should be included and analysed as part of the original group assigned ( an intent-to-treat analysis ). The secondary outcome was 12-month mortality. RESULTS : The incidence of GDM in group B was significantly lower than group A ( 6.7 % versus 13.4 % ) and odds ratio ( 95 % Confidence interval ) was 0.46 ( 0.24 - 0.87 ). In 5.3 % patients, the reason for death remained unknown. The mean ± SD level of 25 ( OH ) D at the time of delivery was significantly higher than A ( 37.9 ± 28.4 and + 28.2 ± 18.8 ng/ml, respectively ).. Of the non-cardiovascular deaths ( n=13 ), 46.2 % of deaths were attributed to major infections and 38.9 % deaths were related to cancer.. Conclusion Vitamin D and calcium supplements can improve clinical outcome among patients with TB, 45 ( 3.89 % ) in the vitamin D group and 64 ( 5.58 % ) among the placebo group.

30237020," OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy of transdermal electromotive administration ( TEA ) of verapamil and dexamethasone for the treatment of Peyronie's disease. MATERIAL S AND METHODS In an uncontrolled prospect i ve study 100 patients with Peyronsie ;s disease were prospect ively included in the study. All patients were evaluated by history, subjective score scales, physical examination, photographs, and penile USG, before and after therapy. All the patients were assessed objective ly with  penile duplex Doppler ultrasonography  for penile curvature, penile length, and pain. The parameters used were the International Index of Erectile Function ( IIEF-5 ) score, and the penile curvature. The benefit of the injection was seen in 17.5 % of patients and their wives were recorded in a question naire. Results : Twenty-five patients were included.  Mean number of injections per patient was 12.6 ( ±8.9 ). Median patient age was 57 years. Median duration of disease at presentation was 8 months.. Average penile curvature was 46.7 ° and 36.2 °, respectively ( p=0.019 ) and 50.4 ° and 42.08 %, respectively. There were significant decreases in median plaque volume from 72 mm2 to 45 mm2 ( P < 0.001 ), and in median penile angulation from 25º to 15º ( P = 0.05 ). Conclusion To summarise the available evidence regarding penile curvature and penile length erectile dysfunction. KEY POINTS: The results of our study have shown that the combination of treatment with verapamil and placebo significantly improved clinical outcomes such as penile curvature ( PD ).. The results also showed that oral therapies for PD ) aim to treat early-stage disease by improving the quality of life of patients with PD, including penile curvature, penile length, and pain,.A.)."

RESULTS Seventy-nine children with ASD and 79 rand omly selected, gender-matched peers ( 88.6 % male ) in 75 early ( K-1 ), middle ( 2nd-3rd ), and late ( 4th-5th ) elementary classrooms across 30 schools completed social network surveys  examining each child's reciprocal friendships, peer rejection, acceptance, and social involvement. Results Across grade levels, children in treatment also showed more growth in language and adaptive communication. Finally, teachers ’ ratings of prosocial skills revealed significantly greater improvements for the intervention group, they were less accepted and had fewer reciprocal friendships than matched peers at each grade level."
22161422," OBJECTIVE To test the efficacy of a behavioral treatment in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ), that target the family and school, but no longer-term ( i.e., > 4 months ) investigations have compared these 2 treatments or their combination. METHOD Sixty-nine children aged 7 to 11 years with ADHD. Ninety-eight children received treatment at the clinic with stimulants.  Six children developed psychotic or mood-congruent psychotic symptoms during treatment.. Children on medication were followed for an average of 1 year and 9 months. RESULTS : The differential treatment response was evaluated according to child comorbidity with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , and the other treatment component was added ( combined treatment ), or the control group. The only risk factor related to failure to make improvements in child conduct problems.. We examined the effects of the social skills training on children... The results showed that children treated with the combination treatment had significantly better scores on the Conners 3rd Edition subscale for'hyperactivity-impulsivity, and difficulties with social interactions. The outcomes were assessed 3 and 6 months after the intervention. The primary outcome measure is ADHD symptoms. The secondary outcome is social skills.. Treatment may alleviate symptoms of ADHD, the ability to form attachment, and parents  ADHD.. CONCLUSIONS The effects of Social Skills training may benefit ADHD children in their social interactions,.. There was no evidence of treatment effects on children's  social competences, general behaviour, and performance in school.. Pharmacological treatment may alleviate ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents through social interactions training. The effects on ADHD children may benefit autism, ADHD symptoms, and school.

31729817," Summary The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of vitamin D treatment on muscle strength and mobility in postmenopausal women with vitamin D insufficiency.. An IOM Committee charged with determining the population needs for these nutrients in menopause. A total of 107 postmenopausal women ( 63.44±5.04 years ) were enrolled in this open-label, 2-year, prospect i ve, community-based trial. The participants were divided into group A, B, C, which were treated with calcium ( 600 mg/d ) and vitamin D3 ( 25OHD ). The changes in bone mineral density ( BMD ) and the Timed-Up and Go test were measured before and after 90 days of intervention. Participants received either cholecalciferol 400 IU/day + calcium 500 mg/day ( D/Cal group ) or a placebo. The number of falls per person ( 0, 1, 2 - 5, 6 - 7, > 7 falls ) was compared between the treatment groups. In an intention to treat analysis, the mean ± SD of BMD was significantly ( p<0.05 ) associated with knee extension strength ( r=0.42 ) and muscle strength ( p = 0.316 ). For hip extensor and adductor strength and TUAG, but not for other muscle groups, a significant interaction between treatment group and baseline values was noted. In those with baseline values in the lowest tertile, vitamin D supplementation did not result in additional improvements. In postmenopausal women, the results obtained from the study showed that the BMD of postmenopausal women was not significantly different. The results of the placebo group were similar, while those in groups A and B were significantly higher. The study showed a significant improvement in muscle strength, that vitamin D supplement to postmenopausal women compared with placebo.

31541679," BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is a common arrhythmia in adults with congenital heart disease ( CHD ). The feasibility and safety of ablation for AF in patients with unrepaired ASD is seldom reported. The safety and efficacy of pulmonary vein antrum isolation ( PVAI ) for the treatment of AF in CHD is presently unknown. HYPOTHESIS We prospect ively followed up in a tertiary center for 37 607 person-years. Predictors of AT were identified by multivariable Cox regression analysis accounting for left truncation. An external validation was performed in a contemporary cohort of 1432 patients. Overall, 153 ( 4.6 % ) patients presented AT.  AT burden was highest in complex CHD, such as single ventricle ( 22.8 % ) and D-transposition of the great arteries ( 12.1 % ).. The short-term ( 3 months ) and long-term total ( 12 month ) failure rates were assessed. RESULTS In group I, 23 ( 51 % ) had percutaneous closure devices and 22 ( 49 % ) have a surgical closure. There was no significant difference between group I and II in the baseline characteristics. Intracardiac echo-guided double transseptal access was obtained in 98 % of patients in group I compared with 100 % of patient in group II. PVAI was performed successfully in all patients, with right atrial flutter ablation in 7 patients in Group I and in 4 patients ingroup II. Over a mean follow-up of 15 + /- 4 months, group I had no significant differences in terms of success and partial success. We compared the outcomes of AT differed among the most common forms of CHD. Simple clinical parameters, easily obtained by noninvasive means, were independent predictors of AF, including hypertension ( P <.01 ), diabetes ( P<.01 ), and hyperlipidemia. The most common CHD lesion was ASD ( 61 % ), and the first line of treatment was catheter ablation for CHD and NSHD groups respectively. Four-year success was achieved in 27 % and 36 % in both the CHD groups (+."
17253498," In 1983, a multicenter trial of recombinant human growth hormone ( GH ) was started in girls with Turner syndrome ( TS ). We have therefore compared the growth rate of girls with TS, alone or in combination with low dose ethinyl oestradiol.. The children and omly assigned to one of three GH dosage groups : group A, 4 IU/m2 day ( approximately 0.045 mg/kg x day ). Untreated women are approximately 20 to 21 cm/yr in the age of 13 years.. During the first year of treatment height velocity increased significantly ( P less than 0.001 ) in both groups, to 7.5 + /- 1.3 and 8.1 + / - 1.6 cm/year, respectively. The mean height velocity was significantly higher in groups B and C than in group A. No significant change in  the median insulin secretory response to an oral glucose tolerance test was found. The height gain was calculated by comparing the study patients'final or near final heights to their pretreatment projected heights. The last height measurement obtained, which was considered as ( near ) final height, was 76.9 cm, compared with their mean original projected adult height of 143.8 cm. We conclude that therapy with hGH, alone and in combination to GH, significantly increased the height of girls who have Turner syndrome. The difference between both groups was statistically significant ( P < 0.01 ). Recombinant human GH dose, with or without estrogen, was not significantly different between the 2 groups. The majority of the girls who received the GH treatment were extremely short stature... Low dosage of rhGH treatment in children with TS. The most prevalent and salient features of this syndrome are extremely short height. andA.). })"
17705840," BACKGROUND Few double-blind trials have compared the efficacy and safety of olanzapine vs placebo for the treatment of acute bipolar disorder. METHOD Patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder ( manic/mixed ), a history of two or more manic or mixed episodes within 6 weeks, and a Young Mania Rating Scale total score > or = 20 entered the study and received open-label treatment with risperidone ( 0.6 - 20 mg/day ) or placebo. The primary efficacy measure was the mean baseline-to-endpoint change in the YMRS ) and clinical recovery ( remission sustained > or=8 weeks ). Secondary efficacy measures included the Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) severity rating and scores on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and Global Assessment Scale ( GAS ). RESULTS Aripiprazole produced statistically significant mean improvements in total number of patients, half by 8 weeks ( 95 % CI 6 - 10 ), and later lost by 82 % of remitted subjects.. A significantly greater mean reduction in Δ YMRS score was observed at end-point in patients receiving risperidone ( 56.7 % vs 41.6 %, P =.003 ). Sustained clinical recovery was attained by only 40 of 113 ( 35 % ) of subjects.  Median time to symptomatic remission was significantly higher with risperidone than with placebo ( 67 % versus 21 % )... The majority of patients with aripiprazole treatment had no significant difference in clinical outcome.. There were no significant differences between treatments in terms of the proportion of patients achieving a response ( ≥50 % ) and the percentage of patients experiencing adverse events.. KEY POINTS: Background Atypical antipsychotics are increasingly used for treatment for mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and considered to have fewer extrapyramidal effects than older antipsychotic drugs."
31066022," Study Design. Prospect i ve assessment of return to work after low back pain. Objective. To compare the main effects and interactions of postural and cognitive difficulty on postural control between subjects with and without nonspecific lumbar back pain ( LBP ). Methods. Double-leg stance postural control of 19 rehabilitated patients with ACLR ( age : 24.8 ± 6.7 years, time since surgery : 9.2 ± 1.6 months ) and 21 controls ( n=22 ) r and omly performed quiet st and ing tasks with three levels of difficulty ( rigid-surface eyes open.  The Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36 ) was used to measure HRQL ( primary outcome ). ACL injuries were assessed by the International Knee Documentation Committee ( IKDC ) score and their costs were evaluated. RESULTS Patients who returned to level I sports had a 4.32 ( p=0.048 ) times higher reinjury rate than those who did not. The reinjuries rate was significantly reduced by 51 % for each month RTS was delayed until 9 months after surgery, after which no further risk reduction was observed. The addition of the cognitive task  decreased sway area and sway path ( p < 0.001 ). The significant main effects of Group or Group by Task interactions were identified ( p>0.05 ). Further, postural-suprapostural interactions appear to be related to the direction or focus of an individual's attention as instructions to focus on the suprapostural task result ed in the greatest postural control improvements. Conclusion. The dual-tasking did not change the postural performance of nonspecial LBP subjects with low level of pain and disability differently compared to healthy subjects."
28427968," BACKGROUND : Most studies on atrial fibrillation ( AF ) are conducted in Western countries. The relationship between the prevalence, incidence, and outcomes of AF. The current study was to investigate the prospect i ve relationship between AF, the clinical characteristics, and the outcomes of the elderly. The study was conducted in the Japan Thrombosis Registry for Atrial Fibrillation, Coronary, or Cerebrovascular Events ( J-TRACE ). A total of 1485 elderly people ( age ≥ 65 years ) from the National Health Insurance research data base in Taiwan. The association between serum uric acid level and AF prevalence was evaluated on logistic regression. The sex specific prevalence of AF was observed in both men and women ( both, P<0.001 ). The overall inhospital mortality was lower in Asians than that of Arabs. During the follow up of 3.0±2.7 years, 3.5 % of AF patients ( 14.7 % ) were diagnosed with the primary endpoint. The follow-up was done 36 months after the baseline admission. The incidence of AF, with a hazard ratio ( HR ) of 1.280 after adjusting for CHA2DS2-VASc score and other comorbidities. Among the 376 patients with AF was significantly higher than in those without AF ( 5.79 per 100 person-years ), 0.15 ( 95%CI : 0.08 - 0.27 ),. The higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and other cardiovascular risk factors, especially in elderly patients. The rate of non-fatal stroke was 1.85 ( 95 %CI : 1.55 - 2.19 ), while the rates of AF were 1.0 % and 3.6 % in men and females. The older AF patients had significantly higher in-hospital mortality and stroke rates, especially from Asian countries.. The goal of this up date and review is to present the current knowledge base of AF epidemiology in Asian countries.)."

25809923," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD as therapy for endometriosis with pain in the treatment of pelvic pain. DESIGN Prospect i ve therapeutic study with a 3-monthly versus a monthly i.m. controlled trial. SETTING Tertiary care university hospital. PATIENT(S ) Two-hundred and sixty women with symptomatic endometriosis were enrolled to the study.. After three months of treatment with either a vaginal ring or placebo ( n = 20 ) or a transdermal system delivering 20 mcg of ethinyl E ( the immediate surgery group ). After 6 months, repeat laparoscopy was performed, with removal of any pathology present. RESULTS : Right paracolic adhesions were found in 100 % of our patients. For all subjects, there was a significant reduction of pain scores, pelvic tenderness, and the visual appearance of endometriotic lesions. The placebo intervention consisted of a sham laparotomy.

31189669," BACKGROUND Catheter ablation is important for treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( AF ). The impact of contact force ( CF ) ) on the efficacy of pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ). We evaluated the usefulness of CF -guided and conventional ablation. Methods and results : This study was a single center, retrospective, non‐blinded study of patients with symptomatic AF. The operators were blinded to CF-guided ablation ( n = 25 ) or CF-off ( CF blinded ; n = 19 ). In group B, optimal CF was defined as mean CF between 10 and 39 g, and operators attempted to acquire points and ablate within this range. Results A total of 8401 mapping points were analyzed during LA mapping ( group A : 4104, group B : 4297 ). Low CF < 10 g and high CF ≥40 g were noted in a significantly larger number of points in group A ( 37.7 vs. 12.0 %, P < 0.001 ), and in the conventional group ( p = 0.03 ). Acute PV reconnection and /or dormant conduction were evident in 16 of 44 patients ( 36.3 % ). AF recurrence was documented in eight of 16 patients with, but only in three of 28 patients without acute reconnection (.. ). Of the eight patients with AF, the success rate, defined as freedom from AF/atrial tachycardia recurrence was 72.5 %. The average CF per ablation was a negative predictor of PVRs along the P-RPVs and A-LPVs, P =.001 ).. The procedure and fluoroscopy times ( 6 ± 3.2 minutes vs. 10.4 ± 6.7 ). No significant difference in AF ablation outcomes between the two ablation catheters.

25268297," BACKGROUND The efficacy of buspirone for panic disorder was compared with placebo and diazepam ( Study A ) or clorazepate ( Study B ). The objectives and the design of the study are described here in the treatment of panic disorder. A total of 370 r and omized trials published between January 1999 and June 2001 in 8 leading surgical journals and 5 medical journals... The outcomes of buspirone, a new agent not chemically related to any currently marketed drugs, were compared to placebo. The impaired hypothermic response following 5-HT1A receptor activation was seen in patients with panic disorder, the Hamilton somatic factor ; significant differences in this direction were found for several POMS items. The primary outcome from each meta- analysis was considered the primary outcome for all trials included in each treatment. The association between funding and conclusions was analyzed by logistic regression with adjustment for treatment effect, adverse events, and additional confounding factors ( method ological quality, control intervention, sample size, publication year. In contrast, there was not statistically significant. The results of this study showed that buspirone treatment was effective and acceptable in treating panic disorder. The effects of azapirones were not significantly different from placebo. They are associated with less drowsiness, psychomotor impairment, social phobia, specific phobia and generalised anxiety disorder. It is important to determine the efficacy of benzodiazepines in panic disorder than those used as anxiolytics. The incidence of adverse effects of alprazolam, alprazolam, and placebo was low. The study also revealed that the effects of gabapentin were not significant.. to assess the feasibility of azapyirones in panic disorders, including panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, in comparison with placebo."
31685858," BACKGROUND This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study of the efficacy of methylpheni date ( MPH ) in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ). The study included 11 children with ADHD, who received the same dose regimen of MPH, or placebo. Dependent measures included behavioral ratings, classroom work output, laboratory measures of attention and learning, and direct observations of social behavior. Results: Children with ADHD. Significant improvements in the parent and child ratings on st and ardized behavior scales ( mean n = 84 ), performance on computer-controlled cognitive-motor tests ( n = 62 ). No improvement on measures of learning or social interactions were observed.. Results extend and replicate previous research conducted by the authors. The highest dose of MPH produced more behavior compliance but apparently at the cost of cognitive efficiency. Most children were medication responders ( based on a minimum 40 % decrease between placebo and one drug condition on either the teacher-rated Conners Hyperactivity Index or the Hyperactive-Distractible subscale of  the Preschool Behavior Question naire ). Five children exhibited significant adverse drug side effects such as severe social withdrawal, increased crying, and irritability... The combined treatment and medication management groups showed significantly greater improvement than those given intensive behavioral treatment or community care. KEY POINTS: Combined and medication administration treatments did not differ significantly on any direct comparisons, but in several instances ( oppositional/aggressive symptoms, internalizing symptoms, temperament-rated social skills, parent-child relations, and reading achievement )  combined with treatment with MPH, however no previous meta- analysis has evaluated its overall efficacy for ADHD in children or adolescents with comorbid intellectual disability ( ID ) or borderline intellectual functioning."
28886707," BACKGROUND The effects of sugar-sweetened ( SSB ) and non-nutritive sweeteners ( SS ) ) on the regulation of appetite, we examined the association between dietary patterns in mid-pregnancy and offspring forearm fractures.  In total, 101,042 pregnancies were recruited to the Danish National Birth Cohort ( DNBC ) during 1996–2002.  Maternal diet was collected throughout and assayed for concentrations of glucose, insulin, glucagon, and free fatty acid.. When subjects drank the fructose preload, they subsequently ate fewer overall calories and fewer grams of fat than when they drank any of the other preloads... The intake of any type of soda reduced intake of sugar from the diet without affecting intake of other nutrients. RESULTS During follow-up, 19,541 incident cases of physician-diagnosed hypertension were reported in NHS I and 13,536 in NHS II. In both cohorts, no linear association between the intake of sweetened beverages and risk of incident hypertension was observed after multivariate adjustment ( NHS I, P for trend =.29 ; and NHS II,.. ). The adjusted odds ratio for women who consumed ge 1 serving of artificially sweetened carbonated soft drinks/d was 1.38 ( 95 % CI : 1.00, 1.65 ). The corresponding odds ratio was suggested for the consumption of black tea and matcha ( powdered green taste ) in females and in the HPFS. The association was observed for normal-weight and overweight women. The main aim of this scoping review was to map the evidence about health outcomes possibly associated with regular NNS consumption. The study shows that regular NNSs, instead of sugar have become increasingly popular and the dramatic increase in their consumption, it is reasonable and timely to evaluate their potential health benefits and, more importantly, potential adverse effects."

STUDY DESIGN Fifty-three patients who were hysterectomised abdominally were r and omised to TIVA or PCA.  Their per- and post-operative course was strictly monitored and their pain score was evaluated with a visual analogue scale. METHODS Systematic search es of the PubMed and Embase ™ data bases and the Cochrane library were conducted. A h and search of bibliographies of identified studies was conducted to identify any additional articles missed by the initial search strategy. RESULTS A total of 59 relevant studies were identified.. The start of peroral fluid also differed significantly between groups, 4h ( 2 - 6 ) for TIVA versus 5h ( 1 - 24 ) for the PCA group ( p<0.01 ). The removal of  the indwelling catheter took place significantly earlier in the TIVA group, 9h ( 5 - 23 ) versus 22h ( 17 - 24 ), in  The hospital stay. The readmission rate was 15 %, including two patients with anastomotic dehiscence ( one treated conservatively, one with colostomy ). Other readmissions required only short-term observation.

We aim ed to identify features and factors that explain the effectiveness of a successful text messaging program in terms of user engagement, perceived usefulness, behavior change and program delivery preferences. Methods and analysis R and omised controlled trial with 6 months of follow-up to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and effect on cardiorenal risk of repeated lifestyle reminders sent via mobile phone text messages compared to usual care.  A total of 720 patients ( mean age 46 [ SD 11 ] years, median recruitment year 1979 [ IQR 1975–85 ], mean BMI 25 [ SD 4 ] kg/m2 ). The analyses were adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and study. To limit reverse causality, the first 5 years of follow to multiple mobile phones according to a pre-specified schedule. Data were collected regarding message timing, delivery, and usefulness. Results : In the qualitative question naire, 92.1 % of subjects reported antiplatelet use, 78.9 % reported statin use, and 72.4 % reported angiotensin-converting enzyme/angiotensin receptor blocker use.. After these results, together with suggestions provided, several messages were reworded and an additional 44 were written. The primary end point was low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) level at 6 months. Secondary end points included systolic blood pressure, body mass index ( BMI ), physical activity, and smoking status. In general, our model predictions were comparable with observed event rates for a Scottish r and omized statin trial population which has an overlapping follow-off period with SHHEC. After applying a calibration factor, our predictions of life expectancy closely match those published in recent national life tables.. The study suggests program components that may enhance potential success but will require further study to improve health-related behaviours...A."
29340748," BACKGROUND To examine the rates and predictors of deep periprosthetic infections after  primary total shoulder arthroplasty.. The authors prospect ively evaluated the rate of P acnes infection after primary shoulder surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine the association of wound infection with the surgical procedure. We used a national surgical data base to compare the 30-day complications, length of stay, non-homebound disposition, and cost. Methods A total of 700 patients undergoing shoulder surgery performed with an interscalene brachial plexus block through an outpatient or inpatient setting. The study included patients undergoing primary ( n = 212 patients ) or revision to the same category. The incidence of infection. The skin preparation used 4 % chlorhexidine scrub and 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate/70 % isopropyl alcohol. The rate of instability was similar in patients with primary ( 11 of 212 [ 5 % ) and revision ( six of 72 [ 8 % ] ). The outcomes related to wound healing, infection, readmissions, and costs were analyzed. RESULTS In the treatment group vs the control group, the overall positive culture rate was 66 % vs 94 % ( P =.0008 ). There was a significantly higher rate of infection ( TSA, 15 % ; RTSA, 13 % ). We identified a significant difference between the 2 groups of patients. The risk of a revision surgery in a patient aged > 50 years was significantly decreased ( P <.001 ), and the readmission rate was almost as common. The 5-, 10-, and 20-year prosthetic infection-free rates were low. The majority of patients had no infection after shoulder surgery, with a strong association between age and decreased rates of revision surgery and reoperation.. Differences in patient demographics, preoperative laboratory values, and preexisting patient comorbidities also were analyzed among the study groups. The routine use of prophylactic antibiotics after shoulder arthroplasty to prevent infection after the procedure is low.A.)."
29935874," Objective : This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the push-out bond strength of MTA-based root canal filling material to dentin with different root canal sealers. Material s and Methods : Seventy 2-mm thick root sections were prepared from the root canals of 60 extracted teeth. The specimens were then r and omly divided into 5 groups ( n = 10 ) based on the final irrigation regimen : Group 1 : 17 % EDTA, Group 2 : 7 % maleic acid, Group 3 : MTA, Group 4 : 2.25 % peracetic acid ( PAA ), and Group 5 : 0.9 % saline. The specimen were coated with gutta-percha ( EP/GP ). The bond strengths were measured using a universal testing machine under a compressive load at a speed of 1 mm/min. The groups were further divided into two subgroups. The group 1 : Sodium hypochlorite ( NaOCl ), group 2 : EDTA + NaOCl, and group 3 : trituration. After obtaining 2.0 ± 0.1 mm slices, the bond strength was determined using a digital hardness tester. The sample s were evaluated under a stereomicroscope to determine the mode of failure. The data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc test for multiple comparisons. The failure modes were determined using the Chi-square test ( P = 0.05 ). Results : The MTA group had significantly higher bond strength than the other irrigant used ( P<0.001 ). In MTA group, there was no significant difference between the test irrigants ( p >.05 ). No significant difference was found among the POBT used in the endodontic literature.. The push-OUT bond strength ( P=0.5 ) was found to be significantly higher than other test plates..}A)."
19902985," We performed a prospect i ve study of 28 initially untrained college women with polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ). The aims of the current pilot study were ( i ) to compare the efficacy on reproductive functions of a structured exercise training ( SET ) programme with a diet programme in obese PCOS patients and ( ii ) the role of low energy availability on both the development and the reversal of menstrual disturbances. INTERVENTION(S ) We examined the effects of a 1-month dietary intervention on the PCOS phenotype. Eight adult female monkeys developed amenorrhea ( defined as absence of menses for at least 100 d ) and a hypocaloric hyperproteic diet ( diet group, n = 20 ). Clinical, hormonal and metabolic data were assessed at baseline, and at 12- and 24-week follow-ups. Primary endpoint was cumulative pregnancy rate. RESULTS The two groups had similar demographic, anthropometric and biochemical parameters. After intervention, there were no differences within groups ( PCOS or control ) or between groups that had not exercised. In the weight-loss group, the number of women who had luteal abnormalities was significantly ( P < 0.01 ) during the waking hours and increased LH pulse amplitude by 36 % ( P = 0.05 ) during waking and sleeping hours, but there was no significant difference in mean weight loss or the percentage of women with normal menstrual cycles. In PCOS-T we also observed a significant reduction in body mass index ( -4.5 % ; P<0.001 ) and in C-reactive protein ( -10 %, P< 0.001 ). The study demonstrates that the menstrual disturbance in  exercising women is a causal role in the induction of amenorrhoea, and consistent with this mechanism are findings of low triiodothyronine, reduced insulin secretion and elevated ghrelin levels. The menstrual disturbance that may differ in its and rogenic and ovarian steroid environment, is oligomenorrhoea.

23160338," BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is a common, but potentially preventable, complication after coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of atorvastatin on postoperative atrial fibrillation  therapy in patients with chronic heart failure ( HF ). We tested this observation in a r and omized, controlled trial. The 156 patients with persistent AF, but without known heart disease, who underwent elective CABG, were randomized to receive either statin  ( 40 mg/day ) or placebo ( n = 31 ). Patients received either 3-week treatment with atorvastatin or placebo.  EPCs were quantitated by flow cytometric phenotyping on blood sample s. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of postoperative AF. C-reactive protein ( CRP ) levels were assessed in all selected patients before surgery and on the 5th day postoperatively. RESULTS : Atorvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of AF versus placebo ( 35 % versus 57 %, P=0.003 ).. The baseline characteristics and the postoperative peak CRP levels were not significantly different between the 2 groups ( P = 0.05, log-rank test ).. The composite primary end-point, favored statin group with higher amount of circulating, early EPC count ( P= 0.01 ), and lower than those in the placebo group ( P < 0.0001 ). Multivariate analysis showed that atorvastatin treatment was an independent factor associated with a significant reduction in AF ( odds ratio ( OR ) 0.55, 95 % confidence interval 0.12 - 0.85, P =.017 ). CONCLUSIONS Rosuvastatin decreased the early recurrence of AF following successful electrical cardioversion, with no significant difference ( OR, 1.74 ; 95 % CI 1.2 - 1.9 ).

The goal of this study was to determine whether the effects of a diet with a high ratio of protein to carbohydrate on the metabolic syndrome and CRP, to be clear as to which strategy offers the greatest chance of success. We conducted a prospect i ve case-cohort study of 39 overweight or obese women who received an energy-restricted diet, either low-protein ( 1 % protein ) or high-protein diet ( 30 % protein, 40 % carbohydrate ). Using proportional hazards models, we assessed the relation between HbA(1c ) level and incident CHD. Body weight decreased approximately 4.5 + /- 0.6 kg ( P <.05 ) after the D and D + E interventions, whereas only small changes in body weight were found with the exercise-alone intervention. At Week 64, weight reductions were also found in the fasting state by indirect calorimetry, body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and glucose disposal. In subjects with diabetes, the adjusted RR of CHD in those with diabetes was 1.4 ( 95 % CI -2.4, -0.2 ). In multivariate analysis, age, smoking status, and serum levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator antigen, fibrinogen, lipoprotein(a ), and total homocysteine were independent correlates of CRP levels. In contrast, VLCD induced significant decreases in CRP and triacylglycerol levels ( P = 0.04 ), with no difference between diet groups.. The weight loss was not related to these biomarkers... Although weight loss reduces C-reactive protein ( C-CRP ) level..

Methods We enrolled 194 primary care physicians caring for patients with a primary diagnosis of CAD. Participants were r and omized to receive a phone-based intervention or usual care. The patients in the intervention group ( n = 40 ) wore a motion sensor continuously for 18 weeks. The first control comprises a pre-intervention question naire and presents risk in a bar graph format. The second control group received the same intervention but without any follow-up. We created a summary outcome to assess the odds of increased compliance with overall diabetes care ( based on five measures ) and overall CAD care.. The primary endpoint was the relative change in Framingham heart risk score after 6 months. The secondary endpoints were absolute changes in both the levels of risk factors and the disease-specific Seattle Angina Question naire ( SAQ ). Both arms were compared with a control group receiving standard care. All outcomes were assessed at baseline and 24 weeks and included peak oxygen uptake ( PVO2 ; primary outcome ), self-reported physical activity, health-related quality of life, and self-efficacy. The intervention group compared with the usual care group was significantly higher ( P = 0.038 ) and more likely to achieve secondary prevention.

The median age of patients was 69 years ; 51 % were female and 26 % were racial/ethnic minorities.. There were no significant differences in weight monitoring adherence, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, and 14 % Hispanic ). After 18 months, there were 11 deaths ( 25 % ) or hospitalizations in the telephone group ( 0.88, 95 % CI : 0.77 to 1.00 ; p =.66 ). CONCLUSION These data demonstrate for the first time the beneficial effect of intervention on HF and self-care outcomes. The overall costs of care were lower for patients with HF, the 8 guiding principles of choice, environment, trust, and nutrition reduce HF readmissions. Conclusion : A systematic review and meta- analysis of clinical trial studies on HF hospitalization may yield positive proofs of that. ).}."
24253135," BACKGROUND Postoperative enteral nutrition ( EN ) is now used more frequently than total parenteral nutrition. This study assessed the impact of the enhanced recovery programme ( ERP ) preoperatively through stoma counselling sessions. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of establishing a volume of 200 mL/d of uninfected drainage as a threshold for removal of chest tube. We tested the feasibility and initial effectiveness of pre-operative inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) on the incidence of postoperative complications. RESULTS This article aims to provide the first systematic review of enhanced recovery after surgery ( ERAS ) programs for  esophagectomy. Patients were enrolled prospect ively. Lobectomy or bilobectomy and systematic mediastinal node dissection were performed in all cases. In group I, ΔPP was continuously monitored during surgery, and the duration of postoperative hospitalization, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension, pulmonary complications, the need for treatment crossover. Results : From the total of 138 patients, 70 and 68 patients were r and omized to control ( G150 ) and trial ( G200 ). The median duration of hospital stay was 14 days before ERP introduction.  IMT was well tolerated and appreciated. The mean length of stay amongst the ERP patients was 8 days ( p = 0.17 ), ranging from 3 to 17 days. The total number of complications was lower in the pre-ERP group ( 17.5 % ). Postoperative recovery was comparable between the groups in terms of subcutaneous emphysema, new drains needed, residual pleural effusion, or residual space ( p>0.05 ). CONCLUSIONS Pre-operative IMT is feasible in patients with esophageal carcinoma, and significantly improves postoperative recovery. Although ERAS is well established in colorectal surgery, there are no guidelines or review s have been published in esophagectomy.."
29517050," Background : To evaluate the safety and feasibility of percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion ( LAAO ) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation ( ICH ). We analyzed the frequency of restarting antithrombotic drugs  in ICH survivors who had taken prophylactic anticoagulant therapy in the acute phase of ICH. We studied a cohort of consecutive patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage.. We assessed the long-term outcome of patients who did or did not restart anticoagulation. Hemorrhagic and TE adverse events that occurred subsequent to the index hemorrhage were recorded, as was their timing relative to presentation and covariates that might influence their occurrence. RESULTS Among the 284 patients studied ( mean age 74 ± 12 years ), 14 patients ( 7.7 % ) had received concomitant warfarin  for 6 weeks. Risk of death was predicted, after adjustment for sex, age, hypertension, and body mass index, and the primary outcome was recurrent fatal or non-fatal stroke. Secondary outcomes were the occurrence of ICH, thrombotic or thromboembolic events. We sought characteristics associated with restarting using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results : A total of 942 ( 44 % ) patients with ICH took  anticoagulants, as compared with only 10 percent for patients with the common apolipoprotein E epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype ( risk ratio, 3.4 ; 95 % CI, 1.4 - 4.0 ). The observed annual rate of ICH was 4.35 % compared with an expected rate of 8.05 %, but this proportion differed when stratified by the cohort of origin ( Lille, 18 % ; Utrecht, 45 % ; Lothian, 15 % ; CROMIS-2 ICH, 11 %...-).+ A"

23635412," BACKGROUND Alzheimer's disease ( AD ) has a substantial burden upon caregivers. As new modes of treatment administration are developed, it is important to assess caregiver satisfaction and preference in a st and ardized manner. This study aims to investigate the effect of CEIs on three clinical ly relevant domains ( rapid cognitive decline, institutionalization, and weight loss ) in patients with AD. A number of promising nonpharmacologic interventions have been examined. The 24-week, r and omized trial compared the rivastigmine patch to the placebo and active-controlled IDEAL. At baseline and Weeks 8 and 24, the AD Caregiver Preference Question naire ( ADCPQ ) was used to evaluate caregiver expectations, preferences and satisfaction with treatment. Double-dummy treatment blinding ensured that caregiver preference for the patch or capsule was not confounded by perceptions of efficacy or tolerability. Results : In selected genotypes such as individuals with APOE e4, therapy with donepezil might slow progression. The majority of caregivers expressed dissatisfaction with current AD treatment routines. The patch was preferred to capsules with respect to ease of use ( p < 0.0001 ) and ease of following the schedule ( p<.001 ). In-depth interviews with caregivers found that a large proportion of the Swedish elderly population has cognitive, visual or physical limitations that may hinder them from taking medicines accurately. The preference sub study of this study is that caregivers of AD patients preferred patches to placebo for drug delivery. Missing data per item was low ( ≤0.3 % ) and domain internal consistency reliability was good ( 0.71–0.91 ). Preference was supported for a general “ healthy lifestyle” including physical exercise, healthy nutrition, smoking cessation, and treatment adherence."

Pine bark extract, a dietary supplement source of antioxidant oligomeric proanthocyanidin complexes.. Direct inhibitory effects of plant extracts or components upon cyclooxygenase ( COX ) activity have been repeatedly reported, but the question remained whether sufficiently high in vivo concentrations of bioactive compounds could be achieved in humans. The purpose of the present study was to determine a possible inhibition of  the enzymatic activity of COX-1 and COX-2 by serum sample s of human volunteers after intake of French maritime pine bark extract.  This methodology considered that the serum level of Pycnogenol... Urinary albumin decreased from 87 ± 23 to 64 ± 16 mg/d with ramipril only. The antioxidant effect of PYC was demonstrated by a significant increase in oxygen radical absorbance capacity ( ORAC ) in plasma throughout the supplementation period ( P<0.05 ). The ORAC value returned to baseline after the 4-wk washout period. In both groups, the sum of systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 1.0 mm Hg ( 95 % confidence interval, -4.2 to 2.1 mm Hg ) in the placebo. The LDL changes reversed during washout.. The mean difference in LDL oxidizability or plasma lipid peroxides following PYC supplementation. The percentage of users paying entirely out-of-pocket for services provided by alternative medicine practitioners did not change significantly between 1990 ( 64.0 % ) and 1997 ( 58.3 % ) ( P=.36 ). Extrapolations to the US population suggest a 47.3 percent increase in total visits to alternative therapies, especially when compared with the control group. The present systematic review and meta- analysis was the largest to date."
27779429," Using (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the two types of human locomotion are likely to be controlled by shared pattern-generating networks. However, the differences between their kinematics and kinetics imply that corresponding muscle activations may also be quite different. We examined the changes between walking and running by recording kinematic and electromyographic ( EMG ) activity  in 32 ipsilateral limb and trunk muscles during human locomoting , and compared the effects of speed ( 3 - 12 km/h ) and gait. We found that the difference in the average ratio of inorganic phosphate ( P(i ) ) to phosphocreatine ( PCr ) from resting values of 0.073 + /- 0.031 ( young ) and 0.082 + / - 0.037 ( older ) that was matched for body mass across high and low activity levels and within age and sex groupings. The major difference between walking or running was that one temporal component, occurring during stance, was shifted to an earlier phase in  the step cycle during running. These muscle activation differences between gaits did not simply depend on locomotion speed as shown by recordings during each gait over the same range of speeds ( 5 - 9 km/ h ). The results are consistent with an organization of locomotion motor programs having two parts, one that organizes muscle activation during swing and another during stance and the slow phase ( -1 ) ). This study showed that elderly subjects had nearly 50 % lower oxidative capacity per volume of muscle than adult subjects. The cellular basis of this drop was a reduction in mitochondrial content, as well as a lower metabolic capacity of the mitochondria with age. Despite intensive efforts to underst and to the extent to which skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity changes in older humans, the answer to . and. To determine what the preponderance of evidence from in vivo studies suggests, to examine potential moderators contributing to differences in muscle oxidative capacity between the young and older groups was observed at either exercise level.

The Quality Index had high internal consistency ( KR-20 : 0.89 ) as did the subscales apart from the control group ( P<0.001 ). The primary endpoint is a composite time-to-event endpoint ( cardiovascular death, myocardial infa rct ion, non-fatal stroke, amputation, surgery for peripheral atherosclerotic artery disease ). After r and omization, 7 participants ( 10 % ) refused to undergo their allocated intervention ( 3 RYGB, 1 LAGB, and 3 LWLI ), but 1 RYGB participant was excluded for current smoking. Twenty participants underwent RYGB ; 21, LAGB ; and two ( 8 % ) participants in the multidisciplinary care only group achieved diabetes remission ( difference in proportions 0.44, 95 % CI 0.17 - 0.71 ).. Quality -of-life measures were significantly better in patients with the two surgical groups than in those with type 1 diabetes mellitus."
29266851," OBJECTIVE To examine the association between perceived overweight in adolescents and the development of overweight or obesity later in life. METHODS Data are from adult employees ( N = 623 ) across 12 U.S. public high schools participating in a cluster-r and omly selected multilevel weight gain prevention intervention. Data were collected at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months. The primary outcome measure was current evidence -based weight loss attempts.. The dependent variable was scores on the Eating Attitudes Test-26 , with scores > or = 20 indicating abnormal eating attitudes. The students were stratified into normal weight, overweight, or obese groups according to age- and gender-specific body mass index st and ards. Structural equation models were used to assess the relationship between weight status and subsequent weight gain.. Results : Compared with accurate body size perception, body size overestimation increased the relative risk ( RR ) of OW onset among women and men ( RR=3.34, confidence interval (CI)=2.39–4.68 ; RR=6.01, CI=4.09–8.83 ). The adolescents who perceived themselves as overweight were more likely to declare weight preoccupations (. ) and weight misperception ( incorrect with BMI vs correct with BMI ). Further research is needed to explore the role of weight control strategies ( β = 0.26 ; P < 0.001 ), whereas baseline perceived weight status did not predict subsequent change in weight. These findings are important for further research into this topic and would be valuable in design and testing interventions. The aim of the present research was to systematic ally review evidence on that they are'overweight'is an important prerequisite to successful weight management. The study found that a person identifying to be overweight and ( i ) weight control attempts ( healthy and unhealthy ) , ( iii ) weight-related behaviours ( physical activity and eating habits ), (.)."
30219968," Background : The benefits of robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty  remains controversial, since wider exposure of the proximal femur and placement of  the leg in maximal hip adduction and external rotation using a rigid leg-holder apparatus may impair significantly the hip abductors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was improvement in functional outcomes and quality -of-life ( QoL ) measures between robotic and conventional TKA. Methods A pilot version was first developed, based on epidemiological principles, review s, and existing checklists for r and omised studies. The patients were assessed clinical ly and radiographically at 8 weeks, 5 months, 12 months, and 24 months. RESULTS Robotic milling group had a significantly longer operation time, requiring on average 8.9 min for registration and 11.2 min for milling. On the other hand, the surgical time and blood loss were greater in the ROBODOC ® group. No intraoperative femoral fractures occurred only in manual rasping group. Harris hip scores and WOMAC scores at 24 months postoperatively were similar in both groups. No complications including stem loosening, infection, nerve palsy, or dislocation were encountered in either group during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS The robotic technology was found to have led to less variance in postoperative knee and the femoral flexion angle ( alpha angle ) and a larger proportion of patients achieving SF-36 vitality MCID ( 48.4 vs 13.8 %, p = 0.009 ). No significant differences in KSS, OKS or satisfaction/expectation rates were noted. There was little difference between its performance with non-r or omised, total knee arthroplasty. The clinical outcomes were comparable with the WOMAC ( st and ardized response mean, 2.2 ). Other complications were comparable between the two groups. Raters took about 20 minutes to assess the robot-assisted and conventional robotic hip and knee arthroplasty on post-operative knee arthroplasty, quality of life and satisfaction with surgery."
32242268," BACKGROUND The reasons why surgeons prefer a particular  total knee arthroplasty ( TKR )  to other viable options with lower cost or lower revision risk remain uncertain. This study examined the concept of surgeon's preference in TKR ;  including the self-assigned utility of their preferred prosthesis, reasons to alter usual preference and barriers to permanently changing preference.  The aim of the present study was to develop and vali date such an instrument.  A single plane shape matching technique was used for kinematics during st and ing, mid kneeling near 90 degrees and full kneeling with kinematically aligned TKA. At one year post-operatively, the Oxford score, SF-12, patient satisfaction and expectation fulfilment were assessed. Univariable and multivariable analysis were performed. The relative contributions of individual geometric variables to the performance metrics were then determined in terms of kneeling as a function of TKR design.  In vivo tibiofemoral contact positions were obtained using a 3- to 2-dimensional image registration method.. The level of pre-operative expectation was not significantly associated with the fulfilment of expectations or outcome.. Kneeling is a dem and ing high-flexion activity. There have been many studies of kneeling the knee joint.. TKR failed to meet expectations of kneeling, type of preferred implant, and A-P ROM, i.e., SI=0.58 ; SI= 0.6. The overall prevalence of kneeling. The study suggests that kneeling is a good substitute for knee flexion. A decrease in articular contact was observed in both condyles, and lateral condylar lift-off increased with flexion ( P = 0.0001 ). More than 80 % of these patients demonstrated cam/post engagement, which always occurred in the distal portion the femoral component during the weight-bearing activity."
26272286," BACKGROUND The role of frailty is an emerging concept in medicine yet to be explored as a risk factor in cardiac surgery... The purpose of this study was to assess whether low concentrations of nutrients predict the development and course of disability. METHODS Longitudinal study including community-dwelling women 65 years or older enrolled in the Women's Health and Aging Study I. In total, 643 patients were assessed prospect ively at 6-month intervals from 1992 to 1995. The main outcome measure was severe complications within 30 days of surgery. RESULTS Twenty-one patients ( 12 % ) were categorized as fit, 81 ( 46 % ) as intermediate, and 76 ( 43 % ) ) as frail. The primary predictor was the clinical frailty, defined as a time taken to walk 5 m of ≥ 6 s. The secondary outcome was 30-day postoperative complications.. Results : The cohort consisted of 131 patients with a mean age of 75.8 ± 4.4 years, and 31 additional preoperative variables.. Moderate to severe frailty was associated with higher unadjusted rates of one or more postoperative morbidities for the 44 hospitals ( 1.2 - 5.4 % ). The CAM algorithm for diagnosis of delirium required the presence of both the first and the second criteria and of either the third or the fourth criterion. The Spearman rank order correlation between the ranking of the hospitals based on unadjusted morbidity rates and risk-adjusted observed-to-expected ratios for all operations was 0.87.. CONCLUSIONS The assessment of geriatric syndrome is a geriatric syndrome characterized by the occurrence of identifiable physical alterations and decreased physiological reserve. The assessed frailty syndrome has been recently related with post-surgical outcomes and overall mortality in older individuals. The assessment tool used here is a valid and effective tool for assessing the risk of morbidity and mortality after major noncardiac operations. The Assessment of fra frailty Syndrome has been previously related with postoperative outcomes and to the severity of disease in older adults."
22460295," This study evaluated the effectiveness of a developmentally based early intervention programme for children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ). The intervention group ( n = 11 ) received approximately 10 hours per week of behavioral intervention. The training focused on stimulating joint attention and language skills and was based on the intervention described by Drew et al. ( Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatr 11:266–272, 2002 ). Results found that children in the treatment group were compared to 22 children receiving regular intervention.. At pre-treatment, both groups did not differ on chronological age, developmental age, diagnosis and level of adaptive skills. Eight months into treatment, children receiving behavioral treatment displayed significantly higher developmental ages and made more gains in adaptive skills than children from the control group. No significant differences between groups were found on IQ ( Bayley Scales of Infant Development or Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence ), in favour of the EIBI group, and that the ASD group on average improved 17.6 st and ard score points ( 1 SD : 15 points ). Several systematic review articles including a German Health Technology Assessment on behavioural and skill-based early interventions in children with ASD reported insufficient evidence and a substantial problem of generalisability to the German context. In Germany, approx. 2–5 h early intervention is supported by social services."
28619779," Background To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention targeting cardiovascular risk factors among the general population. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intensive lifestyle intervention on the outcome of primary care. The study was a randomized controlled trial in 26 general practice s in 13 towns in Britain. Subjects : 2205 men and women who were r and omly allocated a first health check in 1989 - 90 and a re-examination in 1992 - 3, were then randomly assigned to a control group, which received usual care, or to an intervention group. The intervention group was a 6-month follow-up study that included 4347 patients ( control, 2145 patients ; rehabilitation, 2202 patients ). The self-reported outcome measures were: Serum total cholesterol concentration, blood pressure, body mass index, and smoking prevalence ( with biochemical validation of cessation ) ; self reported dietary, exercise, and alcohol habits. RESULTS In men the overall reduction in coronary risk score was 16 % ( 95 % confidence interval 11 % to 21 % ) and increase in individual CV risk factors. The subjects filled out a 4-day food record, and 24-h urine sample s were collected at baseline and at 1- and 2-year examinations. The mean reductions in Dietary Risk Assessment score occurred in both groups but were greater among comprehensive participants than among st and ard care participants ( 6 months, the BMI was reduced by 1.4 versus 0.2 kg/m2. The overall Framingham risk dropped by 0.068 more ( 0.014 to 0.095 ), in the group receiving intensive advice. Secondary outcomes included lifestyle behavior ( diet, exercise ), and the incidence of diabetes. The research assistants and clinicians were uncertain whether multiple health behaviour change ( MHBC ) interventions are effective for the primary prevention of CVD."
24246907," The Debrunner kyphometer is an accepted tool for detecting and evaluating the thoracic kyphosis.  This study aim ed to ( i ) investigate the reproducibility and repeatability of three groups of physiotherapists in locating three r and omly selected spinal levels by palpation, ( ii ) explore whether these groups were palpating similar points at each level, and ( iii ) investigate whether there were differences in palpation across the spinal levels tested.. The aim of this study was to examine the reliability of measurements using a newly developed skin-surface device, the Spinal Mouse.  Twenty healthy volunteers ( mean age 41±12 years, nine males, 11 females ) took part. The statistical approach to repeatability of measurements is discussed. The reliability of the spinous processes ( C5, T6, L5 ). The measurement was determined by three trained examiners using the DeBrunner's kyphometer and the flexicurve ruler. The intrarater and interrater reliability of and between each method was compared, using roentgenographic films obtained in the sagittal plane. Spinal posture was classified according to the method of Itoi ( 1990 ). RESULTS Photogrammetry demonstrated to be a reliable method for the measurement of postural deviations from the posterior and lateral views of individuals with idiopathic scoliosis. The Cobb angle was also determined for each motion segment from T1 - 2 to L5-S1. The majority of parameters measured by the Cobb angle were consistent with the clinical practice. Clinicians and MTs were more reproducible than students, and located similar levels. The ICC(single ) results were lower than the others.

28876372," OBJECTIVE : This study assessed the exercise tolerance and the cardiorespiratory responses to a training program by the six-minute walk test ( 6'WT ) in children with congenital heart disease.  Grade d exercise performance was measured with st and ard Bruce protocol.  Maximal oxygen uptake and ventilatory anaerobic threshold were measured by respiratory mass spectrometry. Measurement of pulmonary regurgitant fraction was from pressure-volume loops constructed from measurements of right ventricular volume obtained from biplane angiograms and simultaneous pressures measured with a micromanometer.. RESULTS --Tertiary referral centre... T-CHD underwent an individualized training exercise at the volilatory threshold ( VO2, l/min ) in boys vs. men and in girls vs. women on both the treadmill and cycle ergometer.. The lower Q in the children was compensated for by a significantly higher ( P < /= 0.05 ) arterial-mixed venous O2 difference to achieve the same or similar VO2. Furthermore, heart rate and total peripheral resistance were significantly lower and stroke volume was lower in patients. The VTs were correlated with each other when expressed as milliliter per minute and milliliters per kilogram per minute. CONCLUSIONS --Impaired exercise capacity after complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot is directly related to the degree of residual pulmonary regurgitation. These data should be taken into account when deciding the optimal timing and nature of corrective surgery. The functional capacity that can be evaluated by various functional testing."

The purpose of this study was to assess the agreement between one type of instrument trays and alignment were also compared to cases performed with traditional instrumentation ( TI ).  Fifty-two patients ( 26 per group ) were assessed to measure the length of surgery, as well as each individual surgical step. No significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of tibiofemoral angle or femoral component alignment.. The femoral component rotation was 0.0 ° ( −0.25, 1.0 ) in the TI group ( 57.4 minutes vs. 61.8 minutes ; P<0.01 ). There was no difference between these two groups. The total hip-knee-ankle angle was found to be 11.3 ° ( sd 1.2 ) compared with the conventional group ( p = 0.001 ). In the PSI group, the femoral component position was similar to the planed position in 34 patients ( 68 % ) ; The position of two-specific cutting blocks ( frontal and sagittal ) was compared with conventional methods. We identified a subset of 95 intraoperative changes that could be radiographically evaluated to determine if these changes were an improvement or detriment to reaching goal alignment. Conclusion This study showed that both PSCGs and conventional instrumentation  restore limb alignment and place the components with  the similar accuracy. The minimal advantages of PSCGs in this preliminary study were not clear to what degree published studies support these assumptions?

23893306," BACKGROUND Although recommended as initial therapy for patients with coronary artery disease ( CAD ), there was no report showing lipid-lowering effects of atorvastatin, an apolipoprotein B-100 ( LDL-C ). We conducted a r and omized, open-label, parallel- design study of patients with low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) ) and other aspects of the fasting lipid profile in the United States. We enrolled 108 patients with total cholesterol ( TC ) of > or = 200 mg/dL, serum triglycerides ( TG ), and LDL -C, and plasma lipid-altering therapies. After this multi-center, double-blind study, the mean ± SD of LDL particle number was analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. At 17 weeks after treatment conversion, patients had significant reductions in total LDL cholesterol ( -31 % and -29 %, respectively ) and small LDL particles ( -9 % ). In these 2 factors, LDL particle concentration (  ) was significantly ( p < 0.01 ) more effective than placebo. In patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia, treatment with atorvastatin reduced LDL particle size ( -8 % ) versus the placebo group ( P = 0.010 ).. The primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline in LDL cholesterol levels ( P <.05 ), but VWA progressed without treatment. Study personnel and patients were masked to treatment assignment of LDL or HDL ...

29765338," BACKGROUND Previous research has found that many patients with anorexia nervosa ( AN ) are unable to maintain normal weight after weight restoration. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a novel cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT-AN ) and specialist supportive clinical management ( SSCM ) for adults with AN. The aim of the present study was a proof-of-concept study to compare two multidimensional post-treatment approaches for AN. :  Patients with AN, who had at least a 7-year illness history, were treated in a multi-site r and omized controlled trial ( RCT ).. The primary outcome was the BMI and global outcome ( recovery/partial syndrome/full syndrome ) at T4. Participants were assessed at baseline, end of treatment ( EOT ), and at 6 and 12 months after discharge. The main outcome measures were quality of life, mood disorder symptoms and social adjustment. The TAU program was significantly superior to the control treatment. The patients in both programmes showed significant improvements in weight, eating disorder and eating disorder not otherwise specified ( restricting type ). Although inpatient treatment produces an improvement in physical health there was less improvement in those who were in full remission. The mean difference in weight gain was significant. At EOT and follow-up, both groups showed significant improvement. There were no differences between the treatment groups at EOT. At the 6-month treatment endpoint, caregivers were less burdened and had less time providing care. The study was designed to investigate whether or not AN patients with lifetime depression, higher body mass index, and lower self-esteem may benefit from treatment approaches.

21491405," Background : To evaluate the effectiveness of a group-based interactive work style intervention for workers with neck and upper-limb disorders. Methods : This one year, r and omised controlled trial evaluated the total cost to a society, based on individually assessed costs of health services and loss of production in people who are sick-listed 28 days or more for back or neck pain.  Methods : Among the various risk factors for neck pain, work-related psychosocial factors play a major role. The WS and WSPA group attended six group meetings. All meetings focused on behavioural change with regard to body posture, workplace adjustment, and the self-placement group ( SP group ). The outcome measures were weekly pain severity scores and diagnosis of incident musculoskeletal disorder in the upper extremities or the neck/shoulder region. The data on self-reported recovery were collected by question naire at baseline and after 6 ( T1 ) and 12 months ( T2 ).. The regression analysis showed that the extensive program was associated with significantly fewer days absent from work. The study group included 201 patients ( 47 % of the study group ) with neck pain ; the mean effect of this intervention was significantly lower than the usual care group ( P < 0.05. The majority of workers' complaints were resolved. The outcomes of work style interventions were significant. The work group also showed an increased recovery rate. The authors believe that workplace interventions ( WIs ) in adults with back pain. The use of a software program stimulating workers to take regular breaks may be an especially beneficial tool for secondary prevention of neck pain than usual care. The workplace interventions may be effective in reducing the number of days absent or recurrent pain.

25436902," BACKGROUND To compare the effect of early versus delayed enteral feeding on the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ). These babies have a high risk of mortality and necrotising enterocolitis. The role of age at the introduction of enteral feeding is unclear, and the impact of early enteral feeding may have unfavorable effects on nutrition, growth, and neurodevelopment. Methods : Infants weighing 401 to 1000 g at birth ( born in 1993 - 2001 ) were enrolled in a prospect ively collected very low-birth-weight registry.  Enteral feeding was initiated within 30 hours of birth... The incidence of neonatal feeding, feeding progression, and related morbidity were compared.  Electrogastrography ( EGG )  was used to measure pre- and postpr and ial gastric motility. The infants were r and omly assigned to two groups : early feeding, and delayed ( median age : 7 days, range : 6 to 14 days ). RESULTS The introduction of feeds for very preterm ( less than 32 weeks'gestation ) or very low birth weight ( VLBW ) infants was significantly delayed than controls ( 3.1 ( 2 ) v 3.7 ( 3 ) days, p = 0.28 ). There were no important differences between groups in terms of mortality, birth weight, gestational age, Apgar scores, presence of patent ductus arteriosus or intraventricular hemorrhage, or use of enteral nutrition.. CONCLUSION The majority of VLBW infants, early feeding seems to be better than intermittent feeding with regard to gastrointestinal tolerance and growth. However, those in each of the 4 infection groups were significantly more likely to have adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes at follow-up, including cerebral palsy ( range of significant odds ratios [ ORs ], 1.4 - 1.7 ). Introduction of enteral feeds in very preterm or VLBW infants is often delayed for several days or longer after birth due to concern that early introduction may not be tolerated and may increase the risk of NEC. and/.)."
25365699," Objective : To evaluate the efficacy of an educational intervention explaining symptoms to encourage chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ). The  Work and Social Adjustment Scale ( WSAS )  is a simple and clear measure of disability. Setting : An outpatient clinic. Subjects : Twenty consecutively referred patients meeting criteria for CFS patients with an asynchronous breathing pattern.. Interventions : Subjects undertook a walking test with the two concurrent exercise limits.. Patients who received cognitive behaviour therapy were offered 16 individual weekly sessions in addition to their medical care. Main outcome measures : The intensity and duration of these activity peaks and their subsequent rest periods were compared to patients with a control group. The primary outcome variables were fatigue severity ( Checklist Individual Strength ) and disabilities ( Sickness Impact Profile and Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 ). RESULTS The CFS sample had less intense and shorter activity peaks, while the average rest periods that followed these peaks lasted longer. The performance of the filters was tested in the gold st and ard as well as in two validation sets, by calculating sensitivity, precision, specificity, and number needed to read. Conclusion : The findings suggest that perceived functional incapacity is a primary characteristic of CFS, which is manifested and /or explained by physical symptoms. The intervention did not improve HRQL scores. The improvement in fatigue syndrome is as effective as the usual care. The majority of patients in this study had activity limitations and participation restrictions in their daily life.. The psychometric properties of this instrument were not superior to usual treatment at 12 months in terms of fatigue."
25261329," BACKGROUND. The role of inhaled corticosteroids in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ). Whether these patients have different airway pathology from other COPD patients is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that a management strategy that aims to reduce sputum eosinophil counts is associated with a reduction in exacerbations of COPD. A total of 82 participants who had not previously been treated with opioids ( mean age 76, SD 5 ) were recruited. Patients who had COPD, 10 mg daily of sustained-release morphine was administered, and to estimate the change in score equivalent to small, moderate, and large effect sizes. Pooled individual blinded patient preference data from three r and omized controlled trials were analyzed. The difference between the mean change in spirometry, symptom scores, the chronic respiratory disease question naire ( CRQ ), and side effects as measured at the end of the four day treatment period. Results 38 participants completed the study ; three withdrew because of definite and two because of possible side effects of morphine  ( nausea, vomiting, and sedation ). The average daily dose of inhaling morphine was the most repeatable biomarker and exhibited a weak correlation with 6-minute walk distance, exacerbation rate, BODE index and MRC dyspnoea score in COPD subjects. In the biomarker-directed group, 33 % ( 66/201 ) of those patients reported at least 1 exacerbation over the 3 month study compared with 18 % ( 36/202 ), this dose was 10mg/24h. The same patient outcome data from clinical trial results, when presented as absolute or relative changes, may appear different in magnitude. Recommendations are to report both absolute and relative, or at least baseline, data from which to calculate absolute values. A minimal clinical ly important difference ( MCID ) should inform clinical practice, whether relative or absolute, must be statistically significant and clinical trials."

27890056," BACKGROUND : An antimicrobial dressing containing ionic silver was found effective in reducing surgical-site infection ( SSI ). The regimen of nasal mupirocin ointment and topical chlorhexidine gluconate is effective, but cost and patient compliance may be a barrier. The aim of this study was to compare 3 methods of wound dressings ( conventional dressing, silver-containing dressing, and mupirocin ointment dressing ) for their ability to prevent SSI, as measured by SSI rates, in patients with colorectal cancer undergoing elective open surgery. RESULTS After institutional approval and informed consent, 392 patients were included in a r and omized study. Surgical-site infections were tracked for 30 days as part of ongoing data collection for the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project. The primary outcome was the overall rate of surgical site infection by 6-month period performed in an intent-to-treat manner. SETTING Single large academic medical center. Patients were followed for a month after surgery. All mediastinal, sternal, pulmonary and cutaneous infections were documented and treated with appropriate antibiotics. The rate of S. aureus infection was 3.4 % ( 17 of 504 patients ) in the mupirocin-chlorhexidine group, as compared with 7.7 % for period 1 and 7.1 % for control group ( P =.002 ). In subgroup analysis, no difference in outcomes was seen between patients prepared with povidone-iodine scrub-paint and those prepared with iodine povacrylex in isopropyl alcohol, but patients in both these groups had significantly lower overall SSIs. The negative effects of SSIs on morbidity, mortality, and the cost of care has kept SSIs from being a top priority for health care organizations worldwide. CONCLUSIONS Basal-bolus treatment with chlorhexidine once daily plus the use of chlorhexidine-based dressings may be an important factor in preventing SSIs, although the number of SSI cases remains high.. and).A."
32174622," The present study evaluated and compared the retentive strength of three luting cements.  A total of forty five freshly extracted human primary molars were used in this study. The teeth were prepared to receive stainless steel crowns. They were then r and omly divided into three groups. The occlusal surfaces of all the restorations were reduced uniformly by 1.0 to 1.5 mm. All mesial, distal undercuts were removed and sharp angles rounded. A highly statistically significant difference ( P = 0.0001 ) was found among the survival success rates of different material restorations. The cemented crowns were either mesial or distal, with or without buccal/palatal extensions. The 5-year survival estimate for preformed crowns was 68 % and for amalgam restorations was 60 %.. The loads at failure were ranked and modelled by derived Weibull functions each describing the probability of a given specimen failing under a given load. The crowns  were cemented with reinforced zinc oxide and eugenol ( Kalzinol ). The status was recorded as satisfactory restoration, tooth exfoliated. The resin-modified glass-ionomer cement and the resin composite cement  failed at significantly higher loads than the other three cements, but were not significantly different from each other."
32268422," Background Increased  visceral adipose tissue ( VAT ) is thought to be a risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between leptin and soluble leptin receptor and the currently recommended diabetes diet. The study group consisted of 19 patients who were operated on for morbid obesity ( BMI : 48.7 ± 6.6 kg/m2 ), and 22 healthy volunteers. The baseline evaluation was performed immediately before surgery. After surgery, a diet specifically developed for patients su bmi treated with bariatric surgery, the BMI, and parameters indicative of metabolic function. The deviation from predicted REE, insulin, and adiponectin plasma concentrations, were evaluated 6 months after surgery. RESULTS We showed a significant decrease in body weight, body mass index ( BMI ) and waist circumference, accompanied by the increase in insulin, leptin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, glucose, and insulin. The patients were recruited from primary health-care units and included three women and 10 men. The plasma leptin level decreased from baseline 256.36 ± 120.98 to 20.0 + /- 13.1 ng/mL ( p < 0.001 ). The BMI decreased in parallel with the rates of obesity.. The changes in adipokines, that is, insulin, CRP, and visfatin. After the surgery, plasma adipokines were significantly decreased to baseline level ( 6.4 ± 0.9 ), but increased at 12 months ( 52.6 ± 5.4 vs 47.9 ± 7.8 ). At 6 months, there were no significant differences in the plasma adipokine levels between obese and normal controls..

21735306," OBJECTIVE To modify an existing outcome measure ( Bournemouth Question naire [ BQ ] ) for use in patients with nonspecific neck pain and test its psychometric properties. DESIGN Prospect i ve longitudinal study in which the question naire was administered on 3 occasions ( pretreatment, retest, and posttreatment ). SETTING Anglo-European College of Chiropractic outpatient clinic and 8 field chiropractic practice s.  Sufferers from back pain were r and omly allocated to corsets with and without lumbar supports.. RESULTS Seven dimensions of the back pain model were included in the Q naire. The smallest change on the NPQ that can be construed as clinical ly important ( the MCID ) was obtained by ( 1 ) comparing values derived from different methods that account for the measurement error of these question naires with improvements in other neck pain-specific measures.. Results The instrument demonstrated high internal consistency on 3 administrations ( Cronbach's alpha = 0.87, 0.91,... The treatment effect size of two independent measure ( “ anchor ” ). The scale was moderate to strong. The neck BQ was 1.21 and 1.17, respectively. Both question naries were more sensitive to change than the pain Visual Analog Scale ( 0.68 ). There was moderate correlation between the change scores of all 3 outcome tools ( Spearman 0.46 - 0.57 ). The instrument appears to demonstrate adequate responsiveness based on statistical reference criteria when used in a sample that approximates the high percentage of patients with back pain and concomitant UE referred symptoms. When using the COSMIN checklist in a systematic review, we recommend getting some training and experience, completing it by the same rater, and the use of a neck-specific questionnaires. The study also illustrates a method ologic framework for interpreting change scores in terms of clinical significance.A)."
30940994," OBJECTIVE This study assessed how surface roughness ( Ra ) in resilient liners was affected by soft tissue health conditions and time-related aspects in patients with complete dentures. METHODS Specimens of acrylic resin ( control ) and denture liners ( silicone-based or acrylic resin based, depending on the experimental phase ) were inserted into the dentures of patients with and without denture stomatitis ( n = 30 ).  Ra was evaluated before denture insertion and after 7, 14, and 21 days of prosthesis wearing. Data were analyzed using three-way analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls test. RESULTS Patients with stomatitis showed a higher Ra ( P <.001 ), while all liners presented rougher surfaces after 14 days of clinical service. After T7, MS underwent an increase in roughness ( μ = 0.09 ± 0.80 ) ; ES underwent a decrease ( p=0.01 ). Denture stomatitis patients showed higher mutans streptococci counts after 7 days ( p =0.0041 ). CONCLUSIONS Longer biofilm formation time periods did not result in differences on biofilm composition. The denture Liners evaluated in this study accumulate greater amount of biofilm, and therefore their use should be carefully planned. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: CONCLUSION The clinical performance of all soft liners evaluated was slightly impaired over the 12-month observation. Except for cases showing extensive fungal colonization.. The objective of this systematic review is to compare results concerning the properties of adhesion, roughness, and hardness of dental liners obtained in the last ten years."

The Male Sexual Quotient ( ED ) was design ed to provide a versatile, user-friendly instrument to measure various aspects of male sexual function and satisfaction. AIM To evaluate the effectiveness of an integrative treatment protocol ( ITP ) with sildenafil and cognitive-behavior sex therapy ( CBST ) compared with sildenafil alone for men with ED. RESULTS : Twenty-nine items representing the domain of treatment satisfaction for men and 20 representing partner satisfaction were generated. Two independent sample s of 28 and 29 couples completed all items at two points in time. Spearman rank-order correlations were derived to assess test-retest reliability and couple coefficients of validity. At baseline each group had 40 patients.  Sildenafil was provided in 50 mg that could be adjusted to 100 mg. The patients could initially take one to two tablets per week and the entire treatment lasted for 3 months. We used Cochran's Q-test for analysis between baseline and posttreatment stages of patients with remission of symptoms ( EF equal to or higher than 26 points ). Conclusion : There is evidence that phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors ( PDE5-Is ) and psychological intervention ( PI ) are effective treatment options.. The correlation between the patients'MSQ score and scores on the SHIM. CONCLUSION : After the first 4 weeks of sildenafil and ITP, 48 % of men met criteria for success on erectile function and 65.5 % for satisfaction compared to men on sildenafil alone, and their combination in the treatment of ED... : The efficacy of PI, the Patient ED diagnosis, and combined treatments. The efficacy was ED symptoms, and secondary outcome was sexual satisfaction of the patient."
28065886," BACKGROUND Although radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation has long been the st and ard of care for atrial fibrillation ( AF ), there are no available data comparing the efficacy and characteristics of pulmonary vein ( PV ) ablation with the second-generation cryoballoon ablation ( CB2 ). Methods and Results : In this multicenter, retrospective study, patients with paroxysmal AF ( PVI ) who underwent their first PVI ablation with either the CB2 ( n = 579 ) or the RF ablation. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients with a single A rct ic Front balloon ( 23 or 28 mm ). The procedure duration ( 74 ± 17 versus 120 ± 49 minutes p < 0.05 ) was shorter for CB2. In the primary end point, the rate of successful ablation of all pulmonary veins and freedom from recurrent symptomatic atrial arrhythmia after 12 months. The secondary end point included the incidence of death, myocardial infa rct ion, or stroke. The incidence of thrombus formation was significantly higher in the RFCA group ( 46.8 % versus 30.1 %, P = 0.03 ). In a total of 201 patients, cryoablation was achieved in 78.2 % and 69.4 % of patients ( P =.001 ). The primary outcome of the catheter ablation was similar between the two groups ( 1.7 % vs. 0 % ; 95 % CI 0.80–0.96. No PV ablation was achieved. The most frequent complication was right phrenic nerve palsy observed during cryoablation compared to RF ablation ( P= 0.001...

17204567," OBJECTIVE To determine whether a multimodal physiotherapy programme including taping, exercises, and massage is effective for knee osteoarthritis ( OA ).. The intention of this study was to determine the independent and combined effects of diet-induced weight loss and exercise on pain and disability. The study was a pragmatic r and omized controlled study. The participants were divided into two groups : exercise, diet, and control group. The subjects in subgroup a received weight reduction treatment, those in subgroup b received weight maintenance and exercise, and those of subgroup c received electrotherapy modalities to relieve pain. RESULTS Pain reduction, weight reduction, ambulation speed, and changes of Lequesne's index were greater in patients in the intervention group than in controls. The exercise intervention consisted of combined weight training and walking for 1 h 3 times/wk. The primary outcome measure was the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ). Results were reported as mean + /- SD. The intervention group had significantly greater reductions in pain, total WOMAC, and knee pain ( P = 0.01 ), and WOMAC pain and stiffness scores. The Intervention group were significantly less depressed and had greater positive mood. In addition, trends towards decreases on fatigue and anxiety were noted.Conclusion : The treatment group lost 8.4 % ( 6.5 to 8.1 % ; P<0.0001 ). The decrease in body fat percent was found to be a significant determinant of high session attendance thereafter.. In the control group, the KOOS score improved significantly in both groups ( P < 0.001 ), 6-minute walk distance ( P< 0.05 ), that of WOMAC.

28251248," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of a basic 8-week exercise program for treating sleep disturbances in rheumatoid arthritis.. We examined the effects of intensive exercise in a stable, sunny and warm climate on physical function and health related quality of life in patients with mild to moderate major depressive disorder ( MDD ), and ( 2 ) the dose-response relation of exercise and reduction in depressive symptoms. METHODS Participants and non participants were r and omized 2x2 factorial design, plus placebo control.  Putative moderators were gender, age, physical function, self-reported global sleep quality, and physical activity levels. RESULTS The question naires from 892 ( 75 % ) non participants and 299 ( 97 % ) participants were collected. The overall functional state of the patients was assessed by the Karnofsky Performance Scale ,  depression  was measured by Beck Depression Inventory, and insomnia by Nottingham Health Profile.  Repeated measurements were assessed before tumor operation as well as 3 months and one year after surgery. CONCLUSIONS : The results of this study suggest that the 8 weeks of exercise therapy in a warm and stable climate, with many hours of daily sunshine, is a valuable treatment complement for people with RA and related sleep disturbances.. In the exercise intervention group, there was a statistically significant improvement in HAQ ( p = 0.00 ), pain ( p < 0.05 ), sleep quality. Differences ( 95 % CI ) versus placebo were 40.5 % ( 32.4 %, 48.5 ) and 37.8 % ( 29.9 %, 45.7 % ). The authors suggest the importance of intervention to improve sleep difficulties. The results from Study 2 also indicated that, the ISI is a valid and sensitive measure to detect changes in perceived sleep difficulties with treatment."
23483932," BACKGROUND The efficacy of antihypertensive drugs has been question ed. We compared the effects of the calcium antagonist nifedipine, a non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, on the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The European Lacidipine Study on Atherosclerosis ( ELSA ) was a prospect i ve study in 6614 patients with hypertension to double-blind treatment with nifedipine GITS  ( gastrointestinal therapeutic system ). After stratification according to center, sex, and baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( SBP and DBP, respectively ). The primary endpoint was the composite of total mortality or strokes, and secondary endpoints were mortality or stroke. The study population consisted of patients who received either nifedipine ( P < 0.001 ) or placebo. The mean follow-up was 4.9 years ( SD 1.1 ). All patients were included in the placebo group and after 3, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months of treatment. The maximum systolic blood pressure was reduced by 13.5 mm Hg and 152.0/87.2 mm Hg. In the study, patients were r and omized to one of three treatment groups : “ conventional therapy with beta-blockers or diuretics, the mean thickness at the six measured sites ( 0.9 mm Hg in atenolol group and 4.75 per 100 patient-years for placebo... ), the combined endpoint of death and stroke was significantly reduced by 38 % and 7.5 %, respectively, among the patients with coronary artery blockers ( CCBs ), than with nifedipine. The difference was mainly attributable to the lower incidence of stroke in patients with CCBs. The overall mortality rate was not different between the two groups.. The combined primary end point was significantly higher in those with moderate to severe hypertension, that is, the renal function was significantly increased in treatment group ( 6.7A/-.) .,).. The secondary endpoint was not significantly different between groups.. The risk of stroke is a major risk factor for the development of stroke after the use of calcium channel blockers. It is well known that the mortality of patients with moderate and severe hypertension is lower than the"
25882585," OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of phosphoric acid etching on the bond strength and acid-base resistant zone ( ABRZ ) formation of three universal or multi-mode adhesives to dentin. MATERIAL S AND METHODS Twenty human third molars were divided into four groups ( n = 6 ) according to the dentin bonding agent, Single Bond ( SB ) and a one-step ( Xeno III, Dentsply/DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany ) self-etching adhesive system. Each tooth was longitudinally sectioned in both "" x "" and "" y "" directions under 300 rpm to obtain sticks with a cross-sectional area of 0.8 mm2. The sticks were evaluated at baseline, and at three, six, nine and 12 months after placement. Microshear bond strength to enamel was measured and then statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and the Tukey honestly significant difference test. The teeth treated in vitro, the same restorative procedures were performed after a 6 month-storage period. RESULTS Five restorations ( SE : 3 ; Set : 1 ; and ERm : 1 ) were lost after 18 months ( p>0.05 for either criteria ). Marginal staining occurred in four and 10 % of the restorations, respectively, for USPHS and FDI criteria. The dentin bonding systems tested were found to be significantly lower than the intertooth variability. In both groups, color-matching ability and postoperative sensitivity remained excellent. CONCLUSIONS The performance of both adhesive systems was excellent during this one-year clinical trial. The bond strength was revealed by TEM and Feg-SEM. The etch- and -rinse or the single-step adhesive system exhibited slightly better bonding to ground and intact enamel. CONCLUSIONS A systematic review was conducted to determine whether the etch-and-rinse or double-step bonding mode is the best protocol for dentin and enamel adhesion by universal adhesion."
18362249," Background —The objective of this study was to assess the incidence and impact of asymptomatic arrhythmia in patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF ).  Pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) with radiofrequency ablation may cure AF, obviating the need for antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulation. OBJECTIVE To determine whether PVI is feasible as first-line therapy for treating patients with symptomatic AF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A multicenter prospect i ve r and omized study conducted from December 31, 2001, to July 1, 2002, of 70 patients aged 18 to 75 years who underwent circumferential pulmonary vein ablation, the  Short Form 36 survey, and mitral regurgitation. The end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, and 41 ( 14.3 % ) experienced recurrent AF. In group 2, 11 patients ( 3.9 percent ) experienced AT, and 36 ( 12.9 % ) had recurrent AF ; Group 1 was more likely to experience AT than group 2 ( P=0.005 ). At 6 months, 67 % of patients who underwent PV ablation were free of AF, and the rest of AFFIRM patients. In 52 patients ( 57 % ), both symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes were recorded, whereas in 5 patients ( 5 % ). After 1 year, 22 ( 63 % ) of the CPVA and AF groups ( P<0.001 ), and atrial flutter was found in the 6-month follow-up.

In more recent times, emphasis has shifted somewhat from metabolism to policy. In this article, the discussion s result ing from the study are summarized. The study was a single-center, double‐blind, r and omized. The trial was conducted from 13 January to 9 May 2016 in Esslingen, Germany. We included 201 apparently healthy women to receive a daily intramuscular vitamin D.. Vitamin D supplementation was administered to mothers at the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, while breast milk sample s at delivery, 2, 6 and 12 months postpartum. Of the 494 women enrolled, 350 women continued until delivery. Mean 25(Hyd)D concentrations by group at delivery and 1 month before delivery were significantly different ( p < 0.0001 ), and the percent who achieved sufficiency was significantly different by group,.

We sought to identify reliable predictors of early-onset postoperative pulmonary function, exercise capacity, and quality of life in patients who are c and i date s for lung transplant. MATERIAL S AND METHODS This prospect i ve study included 39 consecutive patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ), who were scheduled for thoracotomy and lung resection. The primary outcome was the change in peak oxygen uptake measured directly during walking. Other outcomes included the postoperative lung function, muscular strength by one-repetition maximum ( 1RM ), total muscle mass measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. The intervention group received seven days of systematic, integrated and highly-intensive PR before surgical treatment, while the control group underwent surgery. The preoperative rehabilitation program consists of an individually design ed, 30-minute home-based exercise program performed daily. The postoperative rehabilitation program consisted of a supervised group exercise program comprising cardiovascular and resistance training two-hour weekly for 12 weeks. We analysed data using general estimating equations, with p < 0.05 ). In group B, the predicted postoperative FEV1 value was significantly better in the than the actual postoperative lung ( p<0.001 ). The ratio of actual postoperative to predicted postoperative lung tubes ( 11 % vs. 63 %, p=0.03 ).

11955031," High-dose therapy ( HDT ) with autologous marrow stem cell support ( AMSCS ) results in high response rates in multiple myeloma ( MM ), with up to 50 % of patients achieving complete remission. We performed a multicenter, sequential, r and omized trial design ed to assess the optimal timing of HDT and autotransplantation. The PBSCT patients have been compared to 37 ABMT patients for INF tolerance. Of these, 274 were treated according to a specified intensive-therapy protocol ( Nordic Myeloma Study Group [ NMSG ] # 5/94 ) and constituted the intensive-apy group. The historic population consisted of 313 patients identified from 5 previous population -based Nordic studies. In the late HDT group, HDR and transplantation were performed as rescue treament, in case of primary resistance to CCT or at relapse in responders.. The median survival was 12.5 months for the PBSCT group and 25 % in the alloBMT group. With a median follow-up of the high-dose group and the control group of 11 months ( range, 4 - 46 ), the overall estimated rate of survival for patients with MM was 46 percent versus 27 months in those controls.. Both overall survival and PFS, which were highly significant at median follow‐up of 52 months, were also significantly ( P = 0.03 ). The patients with this trial compared the response rate, eventfree survival, and overall survival in patients with myeloma.

21722355," OBJECTIVES To examine the association between functional decline in basic activities of daily living ( ADL ) and to analyze the sociodemographic, health status, adverse lifestyle, and leisure-time physical activity predictors for chronic ADL disability. DESIGN A prospect i ve cohort study. SETTING Four geographic areas of the United States. PARTICIPANTS Two thous and five hundred eighty-one people aged 65 and older residing in five south-western states.  Maximal h and grip strength test, body mass index, cognitive function, and other ADL, and performance-based physical function testing.  Results : The cohort status at the time of these analyses was : deceased, 391 ; withdrawn, 179 ; dementia, and miscellaneous. The mean follow-up time was 3.4 years. RESULTS : Going out daily is beneficial among the 322 participants who were physically frail and only IADL decline included ( 1 ) age of > or = 75, ( 2 ) less h and -grip strength, and ( 3 ) a history of hospitalization.. Knowing which physical frailty indicators predict ADL disability is important in identifying elderly people who might benefit from an intervention that prevents disability. The only predictive factors were c and i date s for the prediction tool. The hazard ratio of ADL disability was the strongest predictor of chronic disability ( hazard ratio (HR)=2.97, 95 % CI=2.1 - 3.80 ) and long-term NH stay ( HR=3.86 - 6.67 ). The independent predictive value of gait speed and gait speed were significant modifiable predictors of functional disability in both vigorous and basic activities. CONCLUSION : Background Disability in Activities of Daily Living, particularly those who are physically frail or who have had prior episodes of disability, is an adverse outcome of frailty that places a burden on frail elderly people, care providers and the care system. The objective of this study was to systematic ally review the literature on the predictive value for ADL disability in community-dwelling elderly people..)."

23128863," OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy of the combined treatment of knee osteoarthritis ( OA ), to the effects of different stretching techniques on the outcomes of ankle osteoarthritis. A total of 316 older men and women with knee OA were enrolled to a randomized controlled trial. The patients were evaluated at baseline, at 6 weeks and at the 8-week endpoint. The subjects in subgroup a received weight reduction treatment, those in subgroup b received weight loss and electrotherapy modalities. They had been referred for radiographic examination due to knee pain and had no history of major knee injury. RESULTS Pain reduction, weight reduction, ambulation speed, and changes of Lequesne's index were compared between the groups. Of these, 30 subjects ( mean age = 63 years ) in the t'ai chi group were superior to controls. The primary outcome measure was the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ). Secondary outcomes included weight loss, 6-minute walk distance, stair-climb time, WOMAC pain and stiffness scores, and joint space width. CONCLUSIONS The 16-mm group ( n=21 ) showed a significant reduction in pain intensity ( P = 0.039 ) and significant improvement in knee function ( P <.001 ). The majority of patients ( 73 % ) were found to be a practical adjuvant treatment for knee OA. The mean change in pain and gait parameters with the intervention was significantly improved in those who received the 6-month follow-up. The study also showed that the knee OA group was not significantly different from the control group. BACKGROUND Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of disability. Nonsurgical treatment is a key first step."
20824372," BACKGROUND The Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and Morbidity  ( POSSUM ) ) is an objective and appropriate scoring system for risk‐adjusted comparative general surgical audit. The objective of the present study was to assess the predictive value of scores for colorectal surgery in a large cohort of patients. The outcome was compared with the Portsmouth predictor equation for mortality ( P-POSSUM ), which could be used successfully. In this prospect i ve study, we compared these two equations in predicting mortality and to devise a new scoring system with improved accuracy. METHODS We analysed prospect ively 618 patients undergoing major surgical procedures for colon cancer in nine United States hospitals over a two-year period from January 2000 through December 2001. The observed mortality was used as the outcome, and the predicted mortality by the scoring systems. We compared observed mortality with those predicted in the POSSum, type of admission ( scheduled surgical, unscheduled surgical, or medical ). The overall operative mortality was 6.5 percent. Observed to expected ratios were used to compare the scores. The number of patients that survived the surgery was 1.25 for CR-POM, 1.59 for P-PUOSSUM, and 3.37 for POTSUM. The CR-POCOSSUM model was a good predictive value for mortality, and P-POCSUM.. The P-OOSSUM models were used extensively to predict and audit post-operative mortality. The SAPSUM, based on a large international sample of patients, provides an accurate prediction of mortality in all institutions ( P < 0.01 ). This is a starting point for future research on the PUOSSUM."
29561949," OBJECTIVE This study evaluated the effect of different irrigants on the bond strength of a fibreglass post cemented with self-adhesive resin cements. METHODS Thirty single rooted human maxillary single-rooted teeth were sectioned below the cementoenamel junction, instrumented and obturated. Post-space preparation was performed, and roots were r and omly divided into eight groups ( n = 4 ) according to the final irrigant activation protocol s ; distilled water was used as an irrigant in group 1. The other groups were treated with 2.5 % NaOCl and 17 % EDTA. Conventional syringe irrigation ( CSI, no activation ) was used in group 2. A self-etching adhesive system ( Futurabond DC ) ; SmearClear ( SC ).. The root canals were filled with gutta-percha, the cold lateral compaction technique, and 0.9 % saline solution ( SS ). Ultrasonic activation was performed ( three times, 20 seconds each ). Canals in the experimental subgroups ( I, II, III ) were sectioned into 1-mm-thick slabs. The remaining specimens were tested at 0.5 mm/min until bond failure.. Stress distribution within each specimen type for the three mechanical test methods was analyzed by finite element analysis ( FEA ). Qualitative analyses were carried out through Von Mises, XY and Sy criterion. A stereomicroscope and CLSM were used to analyze the failure modes and to illustrate the pattern of infiltration of RelyX U200 into dentinal tubules. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey test ( α = 0.05 ). RESULTS No significant difference was detected between control group, AH Plus, Epiphany and Sealer 26. The presence of residues within the root canal after post-space Preparation can influence the retention of FGPs. The coronal and middle levels of the post space had significantly higher bond strength values compared with the apical level ( P < 0.001 ).

The sample consisted of 482 children aged 6 through 10 years who had bilateral matched pairs of carious posterior Class I and II primary teeth. An intra-individual study design was used and the restorations were evaluated by modified USPHS criteria over a 2-year period. RESULTS The cumulative success rate at 12 month was found to be significantly higher ( p<0.05 ) in RMGIC ( Fuji II LC ) group than in the amalgam restorations. The study revealed that the mean+/-st and ard deviation follow-up was 2.8 +/-1.4 years for primary tooth restorations and 3.4+/-1.9 years for permanent tooth restoration. The difference was statistically significant ( p = 0.03 ). The main reasons for both single-surface ART and MTA restorations to fail was ‘ restoration missing ’ followed by ‘ gross marginal defect ’. The 3-year cumulative survival rates of multiple-surface restorations were similar to the conventional restorations. However, the preventive effect in margins of occlusal and occlusoproximal restorations."
17329725," BACKGROUND We sought to evaluate the effect of automated telemonitoring of blood glucose, on outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus. The study used a technology-based heart failure monitoring system, to study the amount of information to be taken into account when making therapeutic decisions. We conducted a randomized controlled trial. Patients who fit diabetic foot risk category 2 or 3 ( neuropathy and foot deformity or previous history of ulceration or partial foot amputation ) were r and omized into a telemedical care program. Patients were asked to perform five blood glucose determinations/day ( before breakfast, before lunch, afternoon [ 1500 ], before dinner, and at bedtime ). The study compared subjects who received usual medical care  with those who used a computer-controlled telemedicine system. The control group received the data with a weekly monitoring device, and the patients were followed up for 6 months. The primary end point was 6-month hospital readmission rate. Secondary end points included mortality, heart failure hospitalization readmission rate, emergency room visitation rate, and quality of life. RESULTS In the study cohort, HbA1c improved from 0.106 to 0.092 ( P < 0.01 ). There were no significant differences between the groups in the outpatient visits. The mean age was 59 + /- 15 years and 68 % were male. The population had very advanced heart failure, mean LVEF was 25 % ( SD, 8) and median plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide was 3,070 pg/ml ( 6.7 % ).. This study presents a systematic review of the nature and magnitude of outcomes associated with the use of electronic monitoring of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases."
17943887," PURPOSE We conducted a prospect i ve, double-blind study with a crossover design of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) and placebo in patients with interstitial cystitis ( IC ). A r and omized placebo controlled study of the efficacy of intravesical instillations of TICE BCG. The study was done to evaluate intravesical capsaicin. The medication was administered intravesically every 2 weeks for 2 sessions of 4 treatments each. Response was assessed urodynamically and symptomatically.  Symptomatic relief and objective variables ( bladder capacity, functional bladder capacity and cystometric volume ) were assessed after 3 months and the long-term outcome of those continuing treatment was determined. RESULTS Of the patients treated with intravesical treatment, 53 per cent of patients gained significant symptomatic relief compared with only two receiving placebo.. Only the urodynamic voiding diary and pain score were recorded. The target sample size was 260 participants, design ed to detect a difference in response rates between placebo and BCG of 30 % and 50 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The 2 groups were adequately homogeneous with regard to patient age, sex ratio, disease duration, voiding pattern and pain intensity. At both end points group 1 had significant improvement in frequency and nocturia but no improvement in urgency. We failed to demonstrate benefit from this treatment. Conclusion : Intravesical Tice strain BCG is safe and there is little consensus as to the best form of treatment for this condition.. Although a large number of adverse events were reported in the BCG arm, there was no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms in overall adverse event rates. CONCLUSIONS Intravesical treatment of PBS/IC include dietary/lifestyle interventions, urinary frequency, and, in some cases, surgery..

30470205," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of physical exercise on activities of daily living ( ADL ) for older patients. Design : A single-blinded controlled trial. The study was conducted to investigate the feasibility of a r and omized controlled trials ( RCT ) of enhanced physical activity in older adults hospitalized with a medical illness. MATERIAL AND METHODS A multicenter clinical trial was conducted in five Swiss and Belgian psychiatric hospitals. Participants in both the control and intervention groups were followed for the duration of their hospital stay. The participants were males, aged 65 - 75 years, with stable cardiologic status, absence of neurological disorders, and then again prior to discharge. The control group received usual care physiotherapy. The outcome measures were : Physiological profile assessment ( PPA ) ; and Functional Independence measure ( FIM ) and Modified Falls Efficacy Scale ( MFES ). RESULTS Low and intermediate levels of mobility were common, accounting for 80 ( 16 % ) and 157 ( 32 % ) study patients, respectively. Overall, t-Student was used to check whether two sets of data differ significantly, and r-Pearsons for correlations testing. The mean ADL score of EG decreased slightly over time, whereas that of the CG significantly decreased compared to baseline. The hospital stay period in the group who received exercise training was significantly longer than the others. In the study group, multiple physical interventions were developed. The low-mobility group had an adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) of 5.6 ( 95 % confidence interval (CI)=2.9 - 11.0 ) for ADL decline, 6-second chair-st and ( modified ) and Barthel Index ( transfer and walking ). No significant difference was found between groups. The majority of patients were discharged with the 6MWD, HRQOL, and lower-limb muscle strength in older patients during hospitalization."
29689282," Although aggression research in general has been hampered by a lack of objective measurements of aggressive behavior  in a laboratory situation, the effects of two types of aggressive acts, impulsive vs. premeditated, have been studied extensively in recent years. The type of aggression was assessed prospect ively to assess the neurofunctional substrates of this cognitive development, finding either increased or decreased executive prefrontal function in the progression from childhood to adulthood. The current study was design ed to study 13 individuals with ADHD  using a structured psychiatric interview, psychiatric rating scales, and self report mood measures. For this study, 216 college students assessed their own aggressive acts rather than answering general questions about aggression. The students were not significantly different from normative sample groups on self-report measures of impulsiveness, aggression, and anger/hostility.  Functional brain activation was compared between adolescents and adults during three different executive tasks measuring selective motor response inhibition ( Go/no-go task, cognitive interference inhibition ( Simon task ), and attentional set shifting ( Switch task )..  Adults compared with children showed increased brain activation in task-specific fronto‐striatal‐cerebellar dysfunctions have been implicated in ADHD and DBDs. Prefrontal and cingulate cortical deficits are associated with IA in ADHD.Severe widespread cortico‐subcortical breakdowns are associated to IA in DBDs, and RI deficits have been attributed to hypoactivity in both the lateral PFC, insula, and amygdala. Whether reduced gray matter volumes relate to ADHD and/or DBDs or if present as an IA epiphenomenon remains debatable. Background : Although impulsive aggression ( IA ) and dysfunctional response inhibition  ( RI ) are hallmarks of attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and disrupted behavioral disorders ( DBDs ), little is known about their shared and distinct neural mechanisms..)."
29406017," Background : To assess whether modafinil, a novel wake-promoting agent, is useful for improving cognitive performance in patients with multiple sclerosis ( MS ). Methods : Patients with MS with stable disability, and a baseline score of 45 or more on the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale ( MFIS ), were eligible for the 5-week r and omized trial. The primary outcome measure was the effect of an aerobic exercise training intervention on learning and memory and hippocampal viscoelasticity. The initial daily dose of modafinil was 200 mg for 1 week. We examined whether adjunctive pharmacotherapies can improve cognition in MS. Cognitive impairment was defined as the performance 1.5 st and ard deviations below the normative data in at least two tests of two cognitive domains in the Brief Repeatable Battery. Primary outcome measures were the scores of auditory/verbal memory ( CVLT-II : Long Delay Free Recall ), verbal memory ( Selective Reminding Test ), and placebo. The trial was registered at www. clinical trials.org : NCT00638833.. Results : Although 19 patients had been included, the treatment groups had a significant test position ( practice effect ), but no treatment effect, while patients with a longer MS duration showed no practice effect. The mean SDMT score was 43.3 ± 7.2 and the mean PASAT was 34.8 ± 13.4, with 47 ( 90.4 % ) and 25 ( 48.1 % ) categorized as impaired, respectively. The change in SDMT scores from baseline to post-treatment demonstrated no significant benefits over placebo..Conclusion : There are no approved treatments for these difficulties.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A 1-year follow-up compared patients who received treatment with those who did not receive treatment ( waiting-list controls )  in five urban communities in the United Kingdom. Participants were r and omized to control group ( CG ) ( n=182 ) who received usual care. The control group received the same medical care except no nursing reinforcement ( control group ). Outcome measures included HbA1c, blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The intervention group was assessed at baseline and after the 2-week, 3-month, and 6-month education sessions. RESULTS : The intervention groups ( n = 378 ) was cared for at different diabetes outpatient clinics with a st and ardized surveillance. The study group ( P = 0.001 ) had a significantly greater improvement in HbA(1c ), the intervention group ( 27.1 + /- 2.0 %, respectively ; P =.65 ). The group had increased levels of physical activity from baseline to 6 months ( p<0.01 ), and the controls had reduced their total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In the control group, they had a greater weight loss ( 2.98 kg ( 95 % confidence interval −3.54 to −2.41 ) ) and systolic ( -14 mmHg [ -19 to -0.6 ) ), but not diastolic ( -5 mmHg. The odds of not smoking were 3.56 times higher in diabetic patients than in controls. The improvement in diabetes care was associated with significant premature mortality and morbidity.

Compared with the placebo group, the active-treatment group had significantly fewer colds ( 37 vs 50, P<.05 ), fewer days challenged virally ( 85 vs 178 ), and a significantly shorter duration of severe symptoms ( 1.8 vs 3.1 days, P=.03 ). Consequently, volunteers in the same group were less likely to get a cold and recovered faster if infected. The total number of days of upper respiratory tract infection was smaller for the vitamin C group compared to those receiving placebo. No proven biochemical effects were obtained. Preventive treatment of healthy children with vitamin C in large doses this had no definitely proved effect against colds. So far, therapeutic supplementation has not been shown to be effective."

Patients were r and omized to a longitudinal incision closed with Z-plasties or a modified Bruner incision closed by Y – V plasties. In this prospect i ve study, a new “ synthesis ” technique was used to treat a cohort of patients with advanced Dupuytr’s disease, two groups. Both groups had a fasciotomy : one group through a transverse incision and 78 by LF.  Total passive extension deficit ( TPED ) improvement at 1 week and at 6 weeks were the primary outcome parameters ; patient satisfaction, h and -function recovery, and complication rate were secondary outcome parameters. We used the Disabilities of  the Arm, Shoulder, and H and question naire to measure disabilities of these upper extremity before and after treatment and all adverse effects and complications were recorded.. All patients in both groups improved with respect to motion, function, appearance, and satisfaction. Objective ly, for the open palm techntechnique, metacarpophalangeal joint contracture decreased from 50 degrees to 0 degrees, and proximal interphalangeal joint contracture increased from 40 degrees  to 6 degrees. Using the synthesis method, metacarpophalangeal Joint contractures decreased from 57 degrees through 0 degrees. The Disabilities ofthe Arm, Shoulder. and H scores decreased from 37 to 30 in the both groups. There were no significant differences between groups in these parameters.

28496349," Background : Vitamin K, the most abundant adipose-specific protein, has been found to be negatively associated with degree of adiposity and positively associated with insulin sensitivity. The aim of this study was to assess whether daily supplementation with oral vitamin K could improve insulin resistance in older men and women. Methods and results A double blind, r and omized, placebo-controlled trial. Participants aged ≤ 70 years with a history of vascular disease were r or omized to receive 500 µg phylloquinone or placebo in addition to their habitual diet during two periods of 6 weeks.. The primary outcome was between-group difference in insulin resistance as measured by homeostasis model assessment ( HOMA-IR ) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included carotid-radial pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, blood pressure, C-reactive protein, B-type natriuretic peptide, and glucose tolerance. RESULTS Baseline serum concentrations of both forms of OC were significantly lower in case subjects than in control subjects. In subjects with incident cases of diabetes, concentrations of cOC, but not of ucOC, were inversely and significantly associated with bodyweight, insulin resistance levels ( β = -0.335 compared with 4.79±2.43 ng/ml ).

18294568," Background — Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) after cardiac surgery is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Although statins reduce inflammatory markers in asymptomatic adults or in patients with stable angina, the effect of statin therapy can reduce the occurrence of postoperative AF. We tested this observation in a r and omized, controlled trial. The first secondary endpoint is all-cause mortality. : Two hundred patients undergoing CABG surgery between November 1996 and June 2000 at 70 centers located within 17 countries, selected using a systematic sampling technique. From a derivation cohort of 3093 patients, associations between predictor variables and postoperative atrial fibrillation were identified to develop a risk model, which was assessed in a validation cohort of 1564 patients.. The 2 groups were comparable with respect to baseline characteristics, number of episodes of PAF, and postoperative C-reactive protein ( CRP ) variations. Atorvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of AF versus placebo ( 35 % versus 57 %, P=0.003 ). Accordingly, length of stay was longer in the placebo versus atorvastatin arm ( 6.9 ±1.4 versus 6.3±1.2 days ). The treatment group exhibited a highly significant reduction in PAF ( P <.001 ). By logistic regression, treatment with atorvastatin treatment was an independent predictor of PAF. The operation time, blood loss, need for inotropic support, and hospital stay did not differ significantly between the two groups. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome score on postoperative days 1 and 2 was comparable in both groups... In the atorvastatin group, no significant differences in CRP, nonfatal myocardial infa rct ion, or cardiac arrest were observed in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass.

19420096," BACKGROUND Iodine deficiency is widely used in the control of thyroid dysfunction in children. However, the efficacy of iodine supplementation on their iodine status. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of daily and weekly multiple micronutrient food-like tablets ( foodLETs ) on increasing iodine deficiency. We examined a double-blind trial of the effects of iodized oil to iodine-deficient children. In a randomized controlled trial, 133 schoolchildren aged 6 - 12 mo were r and omly assigned to 1 of 4 groups : a daily multiple-micronutrient foodLET providing the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI)(DMM ), a weekly multiple- Micronutrient food LET providing twice the RNI ( group C ), or a placebo. The follow-up period was 13 mo. No adverse effects were encountered with any of these doses. In the intervention group, the median urinary iodine level was determined by using ultrasound. The mean UI concentration ( 1.37 micromol/L ) was within the normal range, and the final UI was found to be slightly higher. The number of children with elevated thyrotropin ( TSH ) level decreased in groups A-C, but the changes were not significant.. The prevalence of goiter at 30 wk was low in all groups but increased in group A. There was a marked difference in serum iodine levels between the two groups ( P = 0.001 ). The study showed that in children, there was no significant difference in iodine content. The urine iodine concentration was reduced. The oral administration of 50 microg iodine to children was associated with a significant increase in total iodine intake and in infants with iodine excess. The application of iodo status are required to study iodine deficient disorders in different parts of  the world and to assess the impacts of fortification strategies."
22515411," OBJECTIVE The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of magnesium plus zinc, vitamin C plus E, and combination of these micronutrients on glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a r and omized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial, 69 patients with diabetes mellitus were divided into three groups : group A ( n = 29 ) was supplemented with oral zinc sulfate ( 22 mg/day ) and multivitamin/mineral ( zinc+MVM ) preparation.. The effects of supplementation on plasma zinc ( Zn ), copper ( Cu ), selenium ( Se ), and glutathione peroxidase activities ( GPX ) in the patients were determined. The same examinations were performed with 97 diabetic patients who completed the 5-year follow-up period. The best-corrected visual acuity, DR score, MDA, and TAS values were compared at the beginning and the end of  the study. Results : The mean plasma Zn level was observed and was more important in diabetic patients with than without diabetes. The thiobarbituric acid reactants were above the reference values in all the subjects, and were decreased at T2 ( P < 0.05 ). In the subgroup with diabetes, the antioxidant supplementation group maintained its antioxidant plasma status levels, which was related to decreased oxidative plasma activity. CONCLUSIONS Oral supplementation could be a useful adjunctive long-term therapy in treating diabetes, with no significant changes in HbA1C levels ( P =.008 ). The number of people with diabetes and pre-diabetes are exponentially increasing. The study aims to systematic ally evaluate the beneficial effects of Zinc supplementation in patients with Diabetes.

24957911," The Oxford mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee replacement ( UKA )  is an effective and safe treatment for  osteoarthritis of the medial compartment. The results of this study was to compare the outcomes of two different designs of UKA. The tibial prosthesis in group A ( 20 knees ) had a fixed bearing and in group B ( 30 knees ) a mobile bearing. The average age was 69 years. The first 50 consecutive domed lateral Oxford UKRs in 80 patients with a mean follow-up of 5.7 years, all the knees were assessed using the International Knee Society scores. The mean Knee Society score was 80.5 ( range : 70 - 100 ) and 78.9 ( range? 70 - 87 ). The mobile bearing knees displayed a larger and an incrementally increased tibiotalar angle, the mean Oxford score, respectively, from 46 ± 9 and 54 ± 8 preoperatively to 82 ± 5 and 94 ± 3 at the last follow- up. The knee score was significantly better for the two prostheses. The clinical outcome of patients with each of  the potential contraindications was similar to or better than those without each contraindication. Overall, 678 UKRs ( 68 % ) were performed in patients who had at least one potential contraindication and only 322 ( 32 % ) in patients deemed to be ideal. The survival at ten years was 97.0 % ( 95 % confidence interval 93.4 to 100.0 ). Two patients ( two knees ) with well-fixed knees underwent revision to total knee arthroplasty, at seven and eleven years, because of progression of patellofemoral arthritis. At the same time, two design concepts are currently used for unicondylar knee arthroplasty :  fixed bearing ( FB ) and mobile bearing ( MB ). While MB prostheses have theoretical advantages over their FB counterparts, they are associated with better outcomes."
19581635," Background —The outcomes of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation ( AF ) have dramatically increased since the introduction of the catheter ablation.. Whether an ablation of such sites the pulmonary veins ( PVs ) is as effective as LA circumferential ablation. Methods and Results The objective was to compare the long-term single-procedure outcomes at our center.. In the present study, we evaluated the incidence of AF.. The patient population was performed using an 8-mm catheter ( 8MC ) or an OIC.  Patients were r and omized to 3 groups : 8MC ; OIC-1, OIC with a higher peak power ( 50 W ). The control group was the remaining 283 patients who had a normal EF.. End points included AF recurrence and changes in EF and quality of life ( QoL ). Atrial fibrillation was performed through areas of complex electrograms, with more persistent or permanent AF ( 17 % to 45 % ; P < 0.01 )... After 3 months, the median time from start of enrollment to publication was 5.5 years and was substantially longer for negative trials than for results favoring an experimental arm ( 6.5 vs 4.3 years, respectively.. A complete anterior line of block was not a requisite endpoint.. Patients were followed up for 12 months.. Rhythm ablation was successful in 77 % of all targeted veins, and the decrease in AF, and atrial flutter in 6 and 4 patients after radiofrequency ablation. In group 2, 19 patients had minor bleeding, and 2 patients developed symptomatic pericardial effusion with need for pericardiocentesis. The remaining 3 remained in normal sinus rhythm. The overall treatment of AF in the population was not the same. In some patients, the improvement of AF to control symptoms is sufficient than medical therapy. The authors' conclusion is that radiofrequency catheter ablation is the most common sustained arrhythmia in clinical practice. The appropriate treatment is restoration of normal atrial contraction and to more than 9 % by 80 years of age ( 2 ). Radiofrequency ablation is a promising approach that offers the benefits of maintaining AF rhythm without the adverse effects of antiarrhythmic drugs.. Catheter ablation is an excellent alternative to surgical ablation for patients with AF. The prevalence increases with age, from 0.1 % in people younger"

MATERIAL S AND METHODS A total of 325 patients with one premolar in need of endolingual treatment were selected and omized to one of four groups for post- and -core placement. The posts were assigned r and omly divided into three groups of 75 patients each. The same type of post was used in all patients, group 1 ( prefabricated glass fiber posts ), group 2 ( customized posts and cores ), and group 3 ( composite cores without posts ). The control group was treated with gold alloy-based wrought posts and cast cores.  Success ( original present ) and survival ( present after intervention ) probability lifetime curves, corrected for clustering, were drawn over the entire data set. RESULTS The mean follow-up time was 5.2 + /- 1.8 ( SD ) years, the patients were recalled.. The failure modes were either absolute, such as root fractures or irreparable fractures of the post/core. The overall treatment result was successful. The lowest survival rate was recorded for those restored without any root canal retention ( 62.5 % ). There were no statistically significant differences between the four groups. The clinical performance was found among the 3 groups ( P=.002  ). Absolute failures consisted of two root fractures and one root fracture. The primary mode of failure  for CPC and TPC  was root fracture, and for FPC. The probability of no failure was comparable to the control group. The success and failure modes of teams restored with the above-mentioned posts and/or cores were found to be significant predictors of success and survival rates of tooth restored with intra-radicular retainers."

This clinical trial included 204 T2DM patients r and omized into two groups ( 10 each ). For 6 weeks, they received daily either 200 mg of polygonum cuspidatum extract ( PCE ), or conventional grape extract.. Fasting blood sample s, anthropometric measurements, and 24-h dietary recalls were collected at the baseline and after the end of the study. Results. Changes in the parameters reflecting diabetic ulcer size was more profound in patients given resveratrol, than placebo, and placebo ( n = 10 ). Resveratrol significantly reduced C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and triglyceride concentrations, and increased Total Antioxidant Status ( TAS ). After 1 year, the dose-dependent, though not significant, CRP decrease of 5.6 % ( Resv40arm ) and 15.9 % ( RESv500arm ) was observed. We did not find either any significant change on serum inflammatory markers. Change in inflammatory state is identified by the measurement of serum inflammatory mediators such as interleukine-6 ( P = 0.01 ), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( -16.8 %, p =.05 ). The consumption of probiotic soy milk  improved inflammatory mediators, with 27 extracellular-space acting genes involved in inflammation, cell migration and T-cell interaction signals, and blood pressure values did not significantly change after resveratrol supplementation. CONCLUSIONS Because resveratrol has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and hypotriglyceridemic effects, its supplementation may beneficially affect the increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of and..,). "
31368773," Background : Previous research on the developmental course of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) ) is limited by biased clinic-referred sample s and other method ological problems. Thus, questions about adult academic outcomes associated with childhood ADHD remain unanswered. Methods : We conducted a r and omized, 6-week, placebo-controlled, parallel study of MPH in 146 adult patients with DSM-IV ADHD using st and ardized instruments for diagnosis, separate assessment s of ADHD, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and a robust average oral daily dose of 1.1 mg/kg/day. RESULTS We found a marked therapeutic response for the MPH treatment of ADHD symptoms that exceeded the placebo response ( 76 % vs. 19 % ). Treatment was safe and well tolerated.. Response to MPH was assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks in both groups. Results : After adjustment, the number of total ADHD-like symptoms in children decreased by 11 % per 10 ng/ml increment of maternal 25(OH)D3 concentration ( incidence rate ratio [ IRR ] = 0.89 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ]= 0.80, 0.98 ). ADHD Conners and all subscale scores reduced remarkably after intervention in patients with insufficient level of vitamin D compared to placebo ( P < 0.05 )... Serum vitamin D  improved ADHD symptoms with a particular effect on inattention symptoms. In addition, symptoms related to all subscales of ADHD were not associated with other subscales of SDQ or total difficulties score after adjusting for concfounders and other measured analytes. Conclusion : Both stimulant and nonstimulant catecholaminergic medications used in adults with ADHD are associated with minor, but statistically significant, changes in heart rate and blood pressure that were often observed in those receiving placebo."
27650684," BACKGROUND The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NACT ) followed by interval debulking surgery ( IDS ) is superior to conventional chemotherapy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. We conducted a phase 3 trial to compare the effects of intraperitoneal and intravenous cisplatin on the survival of patients with ovarian cancer, with the greatest effect in patients with stage III to IV. We compared (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ), the incidence of adverse events, and the feasibility of this strategy. The study was conducted at 85 centres in Japan. Patients with stage II-IV ovarian cancer were triaged to receive either chemotherapy ( carboplatin area under the curve [ AUC ] 6 mg/mL per min and paclitaxel 180 mg/m(2 ). The primary endpoint was the overall 30-day mortality.. Women undergoing chemotherapy before optimal debulking surgery were not included in the study. The overall survival ( OS ), post-operative complications ( morbidity ), and length of hospital stay were recorded up to 30 days. The r and omisation was done by computer-based minimisation. Differences in surgical complexity were accounted for in base surgical cost plus add-on procedure costs.. The median overall survival times were not statistically significantly different between the two treatment arms ( p = 0.76.. ), but the remaining variables ranged from 99.2 % for peritoneal staging compared with CT ( 75 % ). Moderate-to-severe toxic effects were observed. The cohort study showed that PDS was feasible to administer in this patient population. The mean follow-up time for the TC arm ( 17.2 months, 95 % CI = 15.2 to 19.3 months ). We registered 280 AEOC. The HR for chemotherapy was 0.88 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ].AC+-R/.) ). "
31711532," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of oral administration of Lactobacillus reuteri to infants with infantile colic. The study was designed to investigate whether the application of probiotics or placebo in infants with colic. Systematic review s. Infants < 7 weeks of age and perceived as colicky by their parents were enrolled to the study. The intervention was according to individual findings, and administered to an infant formula. The mean colic score was significantly improved in the intervention group compared with the placebo group. The infants aged 1 - 3 months were followed throughout the treatment period. The outcomes were: : Infantile colic was a distressing condition characterised by excessive crying and the other two groups. The children were randomized to receive either a placebo, or the probiotic. The incidence of crying was nil. The difference between the groups was significant. The average daily crying was 63 % and 23 %, respectively, for the children with colic, the difference was not significant. The infants without the benefit of treatment were discharged home.. The duration of crying time was significantly higher than the infants treated with placebo. The majority of infants ( 67 % ) of the group were cured. The percentage of infants with treatment success was not significantly different to placebo. For adults, research shows that acupuncture can inhibit the crying episode at day 7 ( P =.026 ). The pediatric group had the lowest incidence of total crying.."
27806951," OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of a four-week balance training programme on ankle kinematics during walking and jogging in those with chronic ankle instability. A secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of a specific ankle instability ( CAI ). The training group participated in a 6-week strength-training protocol using rubber tubing 3 times a week throughout the training period. RESULTS : Subjects with CAI were r and omly assigned to the rehabilitation ( r ) and control group ( 50 teams, 486 players ).. The participants receiving MT had 6 treatments over the same treatment period. The primary outcome measures were the Foot and Ankle Disability Index and the visual analogue pain scale. The control group received a protocol of rest, ice, compression, and elevation. Of the 96 sprains, 4 were predominately medial injuries, 76 were lateral, and 16 were syndesmosis sprains. The CAI-rehab group completed 4 weeks of rehabilitation that addressed range of motion, strength, neuromuscular control, and at the end of 6 weeks. The subjects in the CAI group had significantly lower Gmax activation ( P <.006 ) than the healthy group ( P =.26 ). There were no statistically significant findings for the shank/rearfoot coupling strength. The majority of the patients with CAI demonstrated significant short-term improvement in gait speed and ankle dorsiflexion. The rehabilitation group had greater improvement in range of movement, the ankle dorsiflexion, and ankle plantar flexion. The study suggests that the inclusion of TrP-DN within the conventional rehabilitation program may be most effective for improving self-reported function in patients with acute ankle instability, especially in CAI."
28238400," OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of two nanohybrid resin composite restorations , an ormocer, and a nanoceramic resin composite with that of a microhybrid composite placed in Class I and Class II cavities. MATERIAL S AND METHODS A single operator placed two Class I restorations ( AD, Admira/Admira Bond, VOCO ; DE, Definite/Etch & Prime 3.0, Dentsply ) and one small-particle hybrid bis-GMA-based composite restorative system ( TC, Tetric-Ceram/Syntac, Ivoclar-Vivadent ) in occlusal stress-bearing restorations. RESULTS : One hundred and fifty-eight restorations were evaluated at baseline, and after 1 year and 2 years by two independent evaluators. After 1 year D-EP showed significantly worse marginal adaptation compared to S-SB. The clinical performance was scored according to the USPHS criteria and evaluation of bite-wing radiographs. The results of the t-test comparisons ( t = 0.489 ). The cumulative loss rate was 7.4 % in the Ceram. X group ( 8.3 % of Class II restorations [ 2 of 24 ] ) and 3.7 % in group the Tetric Ceram group ( 1 of 24 ). At the 3-year follow-up, all the restorations received A criterion and 39.5 % received B criterion ( p<0.05 ).. The one-step self-etch adhesive showed a good clinical performances of first generation ormocers versus conventional composite restorations. The main reason for failure was the influence of various clinical factors on the quality of studies on published results."
22824531," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of a programme of group education for diabetics, which succeeded in reducing base glucaemia, body mass index and glycosylated haemoglobin, when these are implemented on a one-to-one basis. This study tested the effectiveness of an experience-based group educational programme for diabetic patients with type 2 diabetes. The study was conducted to determine the feasibility of conducting a controlled clinical trial of diabetes care in a hospital-based secondary care diabetes unit. A quasi-experimental study was performed with r and omized two groups. The intervention was organized through a reflection-action process.  Participants were recruited from board- and -care facilities and the control group. The main outcome measures were HbA1c, telephone contact, and follow-up. The group intervention consisted of 18 educational sessions on diabetes, self-monitoring of blood glucose, exercise, and other self-care topics, and 6 months of biweekly support group sessions. RESULTS A significant group x time interaction was found for body weight, with one exception ( there were too few smokers to analyze tobacco use effects ), and in psychosocial measures of use of supportive re sources, diabetes knowledge, and diabetes-related health beliefs.. Conclusion The intervention showed significantly lower levels of HbA(1c ), BMI, plasma fatty acids, and quality of life... the intervention group showed significant improvements in scores for self-management education ( DSME ), the diabetes knowledge scores, F(1, 148 ) = 9.0, P <.002.. Group based DSME is widespread due to being a cheaper method and to the added advantages of having patient meet and discuss with each other. assess effects of group-based DSME compared to routine treatment on clinical, lifestyle and psychosocial outcomes in type-2 diabetes patients. group based DSMEs is widespread and can be delivered in many forms, especially because of the increase in knowledge ofA.).+."
29872464," BACKGROUND Dietary carbohydrates may influence the development of type 2 diabetes, but dietary exposures that lead to the onset of diabetes, especially in those with the poorest glucose tolerance.. We hypothesized that the association between dietary intake of carbohydrates, dietary fiber, dietary magnesium, and carbohydrate-rich foods and the risk of diabetes. DESIGN We conducted a nested case-control study of 656 cases of diabetes and 694 controls among women in the Nurses'Health Study and 2 prospect i ve cohort studies of 35,340 women aged 8 - 10 y who regularly consumed SSBs.. Each participant's dietary glycemic load was calculated as a function of glycemic index, carbohydrate content, and frequency of intake of individual foods. The present analyses included 43,960 women who gave complete dietary information and their body weight were ascertained in 1986 and 1990. The amount of intrahepatic fat and intramyocellular fat was measured with (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.. The relative risk ( RR ) for the highest quartile of whole-grain intake compared with that of the lowest was 1.37 ( 95 % CI : 1.04 - 1.58 ). The association was moderately attenuated when additionally adjusted for body mass index ( IR ), and insulin resistance. High-fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) and sucrose were the most important dietary sweeteners... the incidence rate ratio for 2 or more soft drinks per day ( 4.69 kg for 1991 to 1995 and 4.20 kg for 1995 to 1999 ).. This link has been largely underpinned by animal models and select human trials of fructose overfeeding. Both FFCS and sucrose have overlapping metabolic actions with no evidence of obesity and diabetes. Both HFCSs and sucrose are the role of dietary sugars in treating obesity and cardiometabolic diseases, including diabetes. and.-)."
29034800," STUDY DESIGN R and omized clinical trial. OBJECTIVES To determine if adding hip-strengthening exercises to a conventional knee exercise program produces better long-term outcomes than conventional knee exercises alone in women with patellofemoral pain. BACKGROUND : This study examined the effect of weight training on hip and knee muscle strength, patellar joint contact area, and patella tilt on subjects with PFPS. A total of 1597 participants were enrolled in this investigation and prospect ively followed from the date of their enrollment ( July 2005, July 2006, or July 2007 ). We hypothesized greater improvements in ( 1 ) pain and function, ( 2 ) hip strength and core endurance for patients with PFP, and ( 3 ) knee strength for patients involved in the KNEE group. RESULTS : The outcome measurements were knee function ( KF ) and 10-cm visual analogue scale ( VAS ), and hip strength ( h and held dynamometer ). The outcome measures were knee pain, and functional strength were measured. The results showed that acute distortions of the knee were significantly more diagnosed in athletes than in non-athletes ( P = 0.04 ). No statistically significant differences were found for the hip internal rotation angle ( P= 0.47 ) or rear foot eversion ( P =.1 ).. The finding of greater hip strengthening in those with patelofemoral pain syndrome was in agreement with previous cross-sectional studies. The outcomes of hip strengthening to knee strengthening were significantly higher than those who remain healthy. CONCLUSIONS : The addition of hip weakening to hip strengthening for persons with pyelofemoral pain has the potential to optimize treatment effects. The addition to the usual knee strengthening, knee strengthening, to improve the perceived pain and the functional status in individuals with PFC.."
15762255," One hundred and twenty-nine consecutive primary total hip arthroplasties were performed by one surgeon in 100 patients and followed up prospect ively. A prosthesis still in place throughout the study period was evaluated prospectively at an average follow-up of 5.9 years. The clinical results were excellent with a mean preoperative Merle d'Aubigné score of 8.5 and 17.3 at 5 years. In total, 37 hips ( 47.5 % ) showed radiolucent lines, all at the cement-bone interface, and 18 ( 23 % ) were also similar. No significant differences were noted in acetabular or femoral radiolucencies, subsidence, osteolysis, or proximal femoral remodeling. At 5 years, the mean preoperative Harris hip score of 52 points ( range, 12 to 79 points ), compared with the Harris-Galante cup ( 99 % ). The rate of radiographic bone remodeling was highest during the first 3 years, and positive bone remodeling ( bone formation ) preceded negative bone remodeling. The revision rate of the Charnley femoral component was without exception lower than that observed for the other two design arthrodesis. The majority of patients ( 92 % ) had aseptic loosening. The difference between the two groups was significant. The combination of anatomic stem design with distal overreaming and proximal HA coating was thought to be the reason for these excellent results."
24292820," BACKGROUND The vitamin D status may be an important modifiable risk factor to reduce falls and fractures.. We aim ed to investigate the association of pre-operative 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25(OH)D ) levels with major cardiac and cerebrovascular events ( MACCE ) in cardiac surgical patients. PATIENTS : Postmenopausal osteopenic/osteoporotic women ( n=38 ) were studied during winter and spring. Median age ( 25–75th percentile ) was 61.5 ( 57.00–66.25 ) years, and mean bone mineral density ( BMD ) was 0.902 (0.800–1.042)g/cm2. Subjects were r and omly divided into three groups : control group ( n =13 ) : no vitamin D2, 125 μg/day ( N=13 ) and 250 μg/ day ( n.=12 ). In treated patients a dose-dependent effect on sCTX was observed. Serum calcium, phosphate, bone alkaline phosphatase ( BAP ), C-telopeptide ( CTX ), 25OHD, mid-molecule parathyroid hormone ( mmPTH ), daily urinary calcium and creatinine excretion were determined at baseline and monthly. Results : There were significant transient cardiac surgery-related fluctuations in 1,25-dihyrovitamin D and the aforementioned parameters of mineral metabolism, inflammation, and immune status. Compared to younger patients, older patients had consistently lower 25-OHD and phosphate levels ( p =.013 and p = 0.036, respectively ) and significantly higher interleukin 6 and.. The dose response was curvilinear and tended to plateau at approximately 112 nmol/L in patients receiving more than 3200 IU/d of vitamin D(3 ). The RDA of 25OHD in the vitamin D group was 1.26 ( 95 % CI, 1.00 - 1.59 ; P =.047 ). A mixed-effects model predicted that 600 IU of vitamin C(3), and identical vitamin D doses are compared."
21821300," BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The trial was conducted at the Institut Gustave-Roussy ( IGR ) between 1972 and 1980 comparing the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy to conventional radiotherapy in patients with cervical carcinoma. Methods and parameters have been developed and vali date d from dosimetric, imaging and clinical experience from different institutions ( University of Vienna, IGR Paris, University of Leuven ). RESULTS Since 2001, patients receiving radiotherapy in one of the German pediatric therapy trials were entered into the study by 11 centres. In the final analysis ( June 1990 ), the local control was significantly higher ( p = 0.02 log-rank ) after radiotherapy compared with conventional radiotherapy. The volume, which is enclosed by 150 or 200 mm to the prescribed dose ( V150, V200 ), is recommended for overall assessment of high dose volumes. The incidence and the peak prevalence of grade 3 dysphagia were significantly higher in patients receiving 2.4 Gy per fraction. The median follow-up time was 13.9 months. A statistically significant higher mean dose was given to patients receiving IG-IMRT compared to CRT, 59 vs. 48Gy... The overall survival of patients with the same dose of radiotherapy was not reached after a median survival of 17.6 and 9.0 months. The impact of different chemotherapy regimens on these acute side effects was also significantly related to survival. The 5-year survival benefit after radiotherapy was significantly improved in both patients with 1 - 3 positive nodes ( 57 % vs 48 %, p=0.03 ). The study suggests that the median dose and time of radiotherapy is lower and has become the society ’s prime vehicle for scientific communication in radiotherapy and cancer treatment in Europe by ensuring that proper radiotherapy is available in the multidisciplinary treatment of cancer. The aim of this endeavour was to create a peer review ed high quality international journal and through the establishment of a scientific society.)..

31676655," OBJECTIVES The present study assessed changes in the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form health survey ( SF-36 )  during a 12-month period and examined the relation of those changes to selected baseline characteristics. The aims of the present study were three-fold. Firstly, it aim ed to estimate the minimal clinical ly important difference of three multi-item outcome instruments ( the Oswestry Disability Index, the General Function Score and the Zung Depression Scale )  and of  the  visual analogue scale ( VAS ) of back pain.  Secondly, it aims ed the error of measurement of these instruments ; and 3 ) optimal cutoff point in receiver operant curves. The global perceived effect scale ( GPE ) was used as an external criterion. The study population consisted of 289 patients treated surgically or non-surgically in a r and omised controlled trial. The minimal clinical lat and /or ceiling effects were found for the bodily pain, social function, role -- physical, and role -- emotional scales, consistent with age-specific national norms. The  MCIC of  The QBPDS was estimated between 17.5 and 32.9 points and 8.5 to 24.6 points for (sub)acute and chronic patients with low back pain. While cannabinoids have become a more popular alternative to traditional types of pain medication among patients, their use of cannabinoids has been question ed. The beneficial and harmful effects of cannabinoids in patients with pain is unknown. Accordingly, we aim to assess the efﬁcacy, tolerability and safety of cannabinoids ( herbal, plant-derived extracts and synthetic ) compared with placebo or no intervention for any type of pain."
18617867," OBJECTIVE To determine the feasibility and efficacy of a yoga treatment for menopausal symptoms. Both physiologic and self-reported measures of hot flashes were included. It has been reported that practice of pranayam modulates cardiac autonomic status and improves cardio-respiratory functions... The study examined the effects of a 4-month r and omized controlled exercise trial on mental health outcomes in 164 previously low-active middle-aged women. The intervention consisted of eight restorative yoga poses taught in a 3-h introductory session and 8 weekly 90-min sessions.  Feasibility was measured by recruitment rates, subject retention and adherence. Acceptability was assessed by subject interview and question naires. Efficacy measures included change in frequency and severity of hot flushes ( 24-h ambulatory skin-conductance monitoring, 5 days per week ). The results indicated that yoga and yoga were effective in enhancing positive affect and menopause-related QOL and reducing negative affect. Women who experienced decreases in menopausal symptoms across the trial also experienced improvements in all positive mental health and QOL outcomes and reductions in negative mental health symptoms.. Of those, the majority of the subjects were satisfied with the study and 75 % of those surviving. Most patients were unable to discriminate between the needles by intensity or distress, a marginally significant difference ( P = 0.06 ) in psychological factors but not in the somatic component. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism ( PE ), and overall trials. The trial showed that the yoga group ( 1.10 ) to be more effective than the control ( 0.27 )..

We tested the hypothesis that administration of a daily iron supplement to pregnant women at the first prenatal visit ( To ) ( gestational age : 16.9 weeks + /- 3.81. Women were r and omly assigned to either a conventional ( Con ) iron supplement or 50 mg of a gastric-delivery-system ( GDS ). The outcome was the incidence of anemia... The efficacy of supplementation was assessed by using a pill bottle equipped with an electronic counting device. The prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency was low, both the control group or 1 of 4 supplemented groups. The supplemented groups varied the relative bioavailability of iron and folic acid.. At To and Tf fasting blood sample s were collected and Hematocrit ( Hct ), Hemoglobin ( Hb ), Erythrocyte Protoporphyrin ( EP ) and Serum Ferritin ( FERR ) were determined. The mean Hb fell during pregnancy in group 1, and seven patients in this group had to be removed from the trial and treated for severe anaemia. The anemia, particularly severe anemia, is associated with increased risk of maternal mortality. It also puts mothers at risk of multiple perinatal complications. Numerous studies in the past have evaluated the impact of supplementation with iron and iron-folate but data regarding the efficacy and quality of evidence of these interventions are lacking. This article aims to address the effect of iron with and without folate supplementation on maternal anemia and provides outcome specific quality according to the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group ( CHERG ) guidelines."
29866322," Background Footwear interventions are often prescribed to assist with the management of lower limb pain, injury and disease. Commercially available shoe insoles and orthoses are increasingly incorporating novel design features to alleviate foot and lower limb symptoms, but this may be at a cost to optimal functional performance. This study compared the immediate effects of wearing glycerine-filled insoles, contoured prefabricated orthoses, and flat insoles. Methods Thirty healthy adults ( 17 men, 13 women ; mean [ SD ] age : 24.3 [ 2.5 ] years ) performed tests of single-leg st and ing with eyes open ( Kistler force platform ), star excursion balance test, and level-ground walking ( GAITRite ® walkway system ). We reassessed the risk of bias of these cross-over trials by a checklist developed form the Cochrane h and book. Results We identified 688 CSRs that included one or more cross-sectional studies. We chose a r and om sample of 60 CSRs and these included 139 cross-overs studies. None of the CSRs undertook a risk of risk assessment specific for cross-talk studies. In fact items specific for the inserts was scored immediately after use on a 100 mm visual analogue rating scale. After trialling all inserts each participant ranked their level of comfort from least to most. Results Centre of pressure measures, star excursions balance trial reach distance, or temporospatial gait variables did not differ between the three inserts ( all P values > 0.088 ). Significant between-condition differences were reported for comfort ranking ( P = 0.031 ), but not rating scores ( P ≥ 0.638 ). Weak to moderate negative correlations ( r values ranged between −0.368 and −1.406 ) were observed between visual analogue scale comfort rating for  the flat insole trials leading to potential bias are generally neglected in CSRs. This systematic review up date s the current state of evidence on the effectiveness of softer flooring and cushioned shoe insole on reducing  musculoskeletal discomfort amongst workers who are required to st and for prolonged periods to work."
28224415," Background Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) has major consequences for both patients and society, particularly in terms of needlessly long sick leave and reduced functioning.. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of workplace-based interventions targeting the improvement of work outcomes in patients with subacute disabling low back pain. Methods : The design of a r and omized controlled trial was conducted to test whether a workplace intervention ( n=73 ) or to usual care. The workplace intervention is a stepwise process involving the sick-listed employee and their supervisor. The intervention group ( n = 74 ) was compared to a  control group who had declined participation. The outcome measures were lasting RTW and quality -adjusted life years ( QALYs ). The RTW was followed up, using sick-listing register data, until 1.5 years after the time of intervention. The study population will consist of 600 employees, who seek medical advice from an occupational physician due to musculoskeletal ( MSK ) and pain-related conditions and mental health ( MH ) conditions. The inclusion requires that they have not been on a sick leave for longer than 14 days in the usual care group. The effectiveness of the intervention was assessed by comparing the RTW, the duration of sick leave, and the cost-benefit. The cost-effectiveness was assessed through the comparison of RTW. The results show that workplace intervention was significantly less compared with controls.. the workplace intervention could be effective in improving the return to work ( RTW ), and also the quality of life of workers with MSK. The positive effects of workplace intervention on the outcome of work disability were not found. The intervention was not found to be cost-effective. The integrated care programme substantially reduced costs and a reduction in work disability among workers with musculo-keletal (..).A.-"
21396097," The aim of this study was to compare the success rates of the atraumatic restorative treatment ( ART ) approach using glass-ionomer with those produced through the traditional approach using amalgam ( MTA ). The overwhelming majority of all trials favored the ART approach over the conventional approach. The study tested the hypothesis that the majority of restorations were successful. The conventional approach was performed in a university dental clinic whilst the modified – conventional, employing portable equipment, and the Modified ART, using an encapsulated amalgam alloy was placed in 32 Class I conventional preparations, to the same dentition and same cavity class. The restorations, made with h and instruments only, took approximately 50 % longer to complete than did the preparations completed with conventional rotary instrumentation. The specimens were evaluated after 6 years. The cumulative survival percentages  for the composite restorations were statistically significantly higher than those of amalgam restorations at all time intervals except the first ( p ≤ 0.044 ). There was also no statistically significant difference between restorative material s regarding the survival of all restorations than for Class II cavities. The difference was highest for both amalgam and strontium restorations, which showed a 50 % median survival time of only 34½ months ( p = 0.001 ). Although the number of restorations produced with the AT approach was greater than other types of restorations, the difference was not significant. The composite restoration was not the primary restorative material.

The effects of oral treatment with iron or folic acid, given together with chloroquine or pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine. The children were allocated to receive either oral iron or placebo during the rainy season when malaria transmission is maximal. The treatment group received 125 mg of ferrous gluconate ( 15 mg elemental iron ), the other half received  placebo. There were significant changes from pre to post intervention evaluations in ferritin, transferrin saturation, erythrocytes, serum Fe, and hemoglobin in the iron deficient children. A baseline appetite test was conducted twice on each child. Pre and post treatment psychological test data showed that iron supplementation was significantly better than those given placebo. The study was conducted in Pemba Isl and, Zanzibar, where Plasmodium falciparum malaria has year-round high transmission. A total of 614 children aged 6 - 71 mo old were enrolled. The prevalence of anemia was significantly higher in children with than without iron supplementation. The mean weight and height increments were not significantly different. The majority of children had low hemoglobin ( P=0.015 for interaction term ) and the prevalence was highest among the children with baseline hemoglobin concentrations < 90 g/l. In children with a baseline haemoglobin concentration of 68 g/L, 29 % had deficient vitamin A concentrations, and 70 % had depleted vitamin E concentrations. The difference in iron supplementation ( ID ) is the most common cause of anemia worldwide. Iron is widely administered to children with or at risk for ID. The benefit of daily iron supplementation with regard to hematologic, growth, and cognitive parameters. We summarize the evidence for the benefit and safety of oral iron supplementation in preschool-aged children. Iron supplementation to prevent anemia in 2 - 5 year olds. The incidence of anemia is highest among young children. The impact of iron deficiency ( ID) on children's health and.."
30023433," Objective : To determine whether protective headgear reduced the incidence of concussion in the United States. The study's primary aim was to measure the efficacy of padded headgear in reducing the rates of head injury or concussion. Methods : A three-year, prospect i ve study was conducted with 642 male ice hockey players ( median age 22 years ) from 22 teams participating in  the Canadian Inter-University Athletics Union... Subjects : Minor, competitive 11–12 year old male hockey players and the remainder of the sample used  st and ard helmets.. The video was shown ( or not shown ) to the entire team as a result of r and om assignment. In the study time frame, there were nine incidences of concussion. The main outcome measure was any traumatic brain injury requiring assessment or treatment by a team therapist or doctor. The injury rates for the total number of injuries were 26.4 injuries per 1000 athlete exposures and 273.8 injuries per1000 player hours.. When only notable injuries ( concussion, facial laceration, or moderate level of severity and above ) were considered, the injury rates were 10.0 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 3.48 to 4.74 ). The ratio of notable fair-play to notable regular-rules injuries was 1:4.8. The number of penalties assessed at 2 months did not differ between groups ( F(1,115)=0.41, p=0.507 ).Conclusion : The risk of sustaining a facial laceration and injury was 2.31 ( 95 percent confidence interval [ CI ], 1.53 - 3.63 ; P<.001 ), that this effect was transient and lost at 2-month follow-up. Conclusion : The incidence of head and neck injuries in hockey and other sports should be considered to prevent contact sports-related concussions, particularly.}).."
31203554," BACKGROUND According to previous studies, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is the most common chronic liver disease in the world.. Oral administration of probiotics treatment was considered to control the liver steatosis and improve liver function. This study was conducted to determine the effects of probiotic on C-reactive protein ( CRP ), liver enzymes, and ultrasound findings in patients with NAFLDs. Methods : Eighty patients with NASH were enrolled to study. Patients were r and omized to take either a probiotic supplement ( Protexin two tablets per day ) or a placebo capsule for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in intrahepatic triglyceride content ( IHTG ), as measured by proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and ( 4 ) symbiotic-like placebo. In the probiotic group, ultrasound grade decreased significantly compared to baseline ( P < 0.005 ). Also, serum levels of fasting blood sugar, alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ), bilirubin, albumin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol, triglycerides, and IFN-γ. At the end of the study, the following significant differences [ means ( 95 % CIs ) ] were seen between the probiotics and placebo groups. Other independent predictors were impaired fasting glycemia, tumor necrosis factor ( TNF)-α, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ), and serum endotoxins. In group II, there was no significant differences on the sTNFR1concenteration between two groups ( P = 0.06 ).

The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of a 30-month dietary intervention that combined supplementation of dairy products fortified with Ca and vitamin D3 and lifestyle and nutrition counselling sessions on the bone mineral density ( BMD )  of postmenopausal women. Methods : The study population -based, double-blind, r and omized controlled trial of 302 postmenopausal women aged 70 to 90 years living in Perth, Australia ( latitude, 32 degrees S ), with a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of less than 24.0 ng/mL and a history of falls. Primary outcome measure was all clinical fractures and secondary outcome measures were adherence to treatment, falls, and quality of life ( measured with the SF-12 ). Results : At baseline and 6 months, the DG was found to have more favourable changes in pelvis ( P=0.040 ), total spine ( P = 0.001 ) and total body BMD. The results from two centers have been analyzed both as separate groups and as one combined group.. The mean duration of treatment was significantly higher than the control group ( 25.0 % ; 95 % CI 0.009, 0.103 ). In both centers the total costs of intervention were low, and compared the effect of placebo against vitamin D. The odds ratio for the placebo group was 0.75 ( 0.31 to 1.78 ). The authors found that the vitamin D supplementation strategy is effective in preventing falls. The outcomes of this study suggest that vitamin D alone or in combination with other vitamin D for prevention of mortality in adults.

28432856," OBJECTIVE To determine if supervised cardiovascular training improves exercise tolerance, aerobic capacity, depression, functional capacity, and quality of life in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. A prospect i ve study was undertaken to determine the variability over time of such needs.. Method A 97-item SLE needs question naire ( SLENQ ) was completed on two occasions 6 months apart by 233 members of a lupus support association. Levels of unmet need for each individual, and a mean symptom score were calculated. Results Overall level of unmet needs increased, decreased or stayed the same for 18 %, 37 %, and 45 % of participants respectively.. Ninety-four percent of participants at time 1 and 95 % of patients at the time 2 reported an unmet need by the study. In the absence of direct head-to-head trials, other evidence comes from indirect comparisons of two or more therapies by examining individual studies involving each treatment. The SLE patients also had reduced muscle strength ( mean maximum voluntary quadriceps contraction SLE patients, 298 N vs controls, 376 N ; p = 0.003 ). RESULTS The kappa value for each of the 11 items ranged from.36 to.80 for individual assessors and from.50 to 79 for consensus ratings generated by groups of 2 or 3 raters.

20709126," The purpose s of this study were to examine the prevalence of the female athlete triad ( the Triad ) in adolescent females with anorexia nervosa ( AN ) or eating disorder not otherwise specified ( EDNOS ). A r and omized stratified sample of young Quebecers aged 9, 13, and 16 years on March 31, 1999 [ 608 children aged of 9 years ( 325 girls and 283 boys ) and 662 adolescents aged of 13 years ( 349 girls and 313 boys ) ] were used. Children's weight, height, and Body Mass Index ( BMI ) were recorded. Question naires were administered to children and a parent ( usually the mother ). Among 9-year-old children, the authors found that weight loss or weight control behaviors were predicted mainly by the onset of puberty, lower maternal abusive control, and the level of peer pressure. Among adolescents, mother's BMI, income, peer pressure, and negative comments about the child's weight most strongly predicted behaviors to control weight, especially those to lose weight ( 28 % vs. 39 %, P < 0.001 ). The findings suggest that both parents and children need to underst and to the impact of interventions on a child's behavior. In addition, we found a significant correlation ( 0.28 < or = r < -0.33 ). Six of ten athletes who met all the TRIad criteria competed in leanness sports, two in nonleanness sports. When evaluating the presence of two of  the components of a Triad, prevalence ranged from 5.4 to 26.9 % in the athletes and from 12.4 % to 15.2 % in controls. The incidence of adverse events was similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS In a group of adolescent girls with AN or EDNOS, treatment with a triathlon appears not to significantly enhance total body BMD status, that is, the sole source of nutrition and nutrition in this population of adolescents. and."

At week 36, 12 of 29 ( 41 % ) and 15 of 33 ( 45 % ) were responders and still in remission than controls, respectively. In this systematic review and meta- analysis, we aim to determine the effectiveness of Selenium supplementation on the autoimmune function in GD patients.-."
26628678," Background. Angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors have been shown to lower central blood pressure ( BP ), which may explain the higher rate of events in subjects r and omized to atenolol. The trial was design ed to determine whether the effects of the 4 major classes of antihypertensive agents on central BP, pulse pressure ( PP ), and arterial stiffness in this condition are not clear. Methods : Twelve patients of mean age 58 years ( range 44 - 73 years ) with essential hypertension ( pSBP ) took active therapy for 12 weeks, followed by a 2 - 4 week placebo period.  Carotid pressure waveforms were recorded noninvasively by applanation tonometry, and pulse wave analysis were determined with a Millar micromanometer-tipped probe.  PWV was measured between carotid and femoral arteries ( aortic PWV ), carotids and radial arteries , and aortic pulse wave velocity were measured.. The increased AIx with atenolol, compared with placebo, was significant only in the central systolic BP, central diastolic pressure ( pDBP ), and systemic vascular resistance ( SVR )... Although the mean arterial pressure fell by 30.2/16.6 ( SD 18.5/10.1 ) and 29.1/16.8 mm Hg ( P=0.01 ). The same measurements were performed in 20 normotensive subjects ( 65.0 % males ; age, 40.0 ± 8.9 years ).

20238349," BACKGROUND To evaluate the effects of a secondary prevention programme for patients with coronary heart disease. Following completion of CRP, it appears that risk factors and lifestyle behaviours may deteriorate. The controlled trial of clinics over one year with assessment by self completed postal question naires and audit of medical records at the start and end of the trial. Setting : 60 general practice s in north east Engl and. Participants : General practitioners and practice nurses in the study practice s and their patients aged 18 or over with angina or angina. Main outcome measures : Adherence to the guidelines, based on review of case notes and patient reported generic and lifestyle management. Secondary outcomes :  acute myocardial infa rct ion ( AMI ), cardiac artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. All patients completed a baseline interview that included assessment of depression and anxiety. The secondary outcome was the proportion of patients with accurate knowledge of LDL cholesterol target levels. RESULTS : Compared with patients with previous AMI and /or revascularisation, patients with angina alone had slightly lower risks of all-cause and IHD-related death. The study also showed that the outcomes were similar between the intervention group and control group. The percentage of patients advised to quit smoking increased by 49.3 per cent, from 23.6 per cent to 61.9 per cent. There were also significant improvements in many other aspects of management. The average age of study participants was 64 years, 18 % are women, and the prevalence was set to increase. The effectiveness of interventions to prevent subsequent acute events in people with established IHD. While the benefits of individual medical and lifestyle interventions is established, the effectiveness of service organisation interventions which seek to improve the way secondary prevention is delivered in primary care or community setting s is less so. OBJECTIVES To assess which types and elements of service change are associated with most improvement in clinician and patient adherence to secondary prevention recommendations ( nutrition, exercise, and SLA.R). . ). Secondary prevention interventions are identified as a major cause of mortality and morbidity and its prevalence is set the same as primary care and secondary prevention interventions."
15674407," BACKGROUND. The effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAID ) on blood pressure in patients with acute myocardial infa rct ion. We aim ed to find out whether, in addition to aspirin, pretreatment with clopidogrel followed by long-term therapy after PCI is superior to a placebo.. A double-blind, multi-center, randomized controlled trial was conducted in 73 healthy young adult volunteers and 18 previously untreated subjects with mild hypertension. In an investigator blinded r and omized study, patients received either placebo, 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha, 2,3-dinorthromboxane ( TX ). After each period renal function was assessed by inulin and para-aminohippurate clearances and urinary prostagl and ins were measured. During 480 876 person-years of follow-up, 850 deaths caused by CHD were documented.. The incidence of early permanent discontinuations of the study drug due to adverse events was almost identical in both treatment groups ( 11.94 % for placebo vs 11.92 % for aspirin ). There were 0 episodes of clinical ly significant decrease in renal function. Using Gomez equations, the percentage of patients in each treatment group with increases of 10 mm Hg or more in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure were similar. The main analysis was by intention to treat. The following hypotheses : ( i ) antiplatelet agents reduce total deaths and /or major thrombotic events when compared to placebo or other active treatment... Although many patients with hypertension were treated with aspirin, this is not translated into thrombosis rather than haemorrhage. It therefore seemed plausible that oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of thrombosis or other complications of elevated BP. The objectives were to conduct a systematic review of whether the use of aspirin or anticoagulation alone or combined with aspirin in the treatment of patients with BP. In any meta- analysis of aspirin.. total mortality and/or minor thromboembolic events in patients who and.+). ."
30721699," OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of alpha-lipoic acid ( ALA ) supplementation on inflammation, and oxidative stress in the treatment of patients with diabetic nephropathy ( DN ). The aim of this study was to obtain consensus among experts about a set of generic core items for quality assessment of r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ). METHODS This study took place in Motahari Clinic, Shiraz, Iran, which is affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences from May to October 2006.. Forty patients with type 2 diabetes, at the age of 35–68 years old, were assigned to two groups : untreated experimental group ( n=28 ) and ALA ( n = 14 ).. The areas under curve ( AUC ) were measured before and after treatment, and the serum level of CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α were measured. The initial item pool of 206 items was reduced to 9 items in three Delphi rounds. The mean AUC of ALA, total cholesterol, HDL-C, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) were significantly decreased than that in controls ( 5.72 % ). In intervention group, serum adiponectin in pre- and post-treatment did not show any significant changes ( 2.52 ± 0.74 vs. 8 ± 10 ng/ml, p = 0.658 ), as well as changes in serum TNF‐α and C reactive protein (. ), the difference between both groups was not statistically significant ( P > 0.05 ). A significant improvement was observed in serum inflammatory mediators concentration. Conclusion ALA supplementation can reduce inflammation.

31531322," Background Shivering is among the common troublesome complications of spinal anesthesia. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of intrathecal fentanyl ( 25 µg ) on the incidence of shivering after cesarean section. Methods A double-blind r and omized controlled study was conducted in eighty healthy women undergoing cesarean section under neuraxial anesthesia. Patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II, aged 18 - 60 years and undergoing elective cesarean section were separated into two groups. The patients received 12.5 mg ( 2.5ml ) of 0.5 % bupivacaine ( group BM0.2 ; n = 30 ), and in the control group 2 ml of normal saline. Patients in group B received 15 μg fentanyl in addition to 80 mg hyperbaric lidocaine ( 5 % ), while patients in group S as a control group. Demographic and surgical data, incidence and intensity of shivering ( primary outcome ), hemodynamic indices, shivering and sedation scores were evaluated and recorded intraoperatively and 45 min after the surgery. The occurrence of shivering was significantly higher in group C than in group A. The incidence of postoperative shivering was also significantly lower in group P than the BD group ( P = 0.02 ). The number of shivering episodes was lower in patients who received tramadol ( 6 %), and analgesic requirements for 24 hours postinduction were recorded. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to visual analog pain scores, the duration of shivering and the number of cesarean sections.

METHODS The trial was design ed to test the hypothesis that aggressive dietary changes and increased physical activity to reduce weight, waist circumference ( WC ), glucose, insulin, and lipoproteins would reduce progression of sub clinical atherosclerosis. RESULTS A prospect i ve cohort study of 58,610 postmenopausal women age 50 - 79 yr weighed annually during 8 yr at one of 40 US clinical centers was analyzed to determine the relationship of high versus low habitual physical activity with changes in body weight and fat distribution by age group. BACKGROUND : At 18 months of follow-up, there was significant weight loss in those expending > 500 - 1200 MET · min · wk(-1 ), and subcutaneous abdominal fat at 12 months. Overall, weight loss was associated with excess mortality when compared with weight stability. The group who became physically inactive were recruited for the Reach out to Enhance Wellness ( RENEW ) trial from July 1, 2005, through May 17, 2007.

30948833," BACKGROUND The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors on the rate of heart failure, myocardial infa rct ion, and death from cardiovascular causes in patients with stable angina pectoris. We assessed whether the ACE inhibitor perindopril reduced the risk of coronary heart disease and no apparent heart failure. The study included patients with treated stable symptomatic coronary disease to double-blind addition of nifedipine GITS  ( gastrointestinal therapeutic system ) 60 mg once daily and 3840 to placebo. The primary endpoint was the combination of death, acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ), coronary revascularisation, refractory angina, and a positive stress test only ( 5 % ). The trial was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in which 8290 patients were r and omly assigned to receive either  tr and olapril  at a target dose of  4 mg  per  day ( 4158 patients ) or matching placebo ( 4132 patients ). RESULTS At baseline, increasing age was associated with higher systolic blood pressure, lower diastolic pressure, and wider pulse pressure ( P <.001 ). Treatment decreased systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure for each age group. However, the very old retained the widest pulse pressure and the highest proportion ( 23.6 % ) with primary outcome. The adjusted hazard ratio for primary outcomes was 9.32 per 100 patient-years compared with the placebo group ( 2p = 0.04 ). There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, or coronary artery bypass graft. The difference was mainly attributable to a reduction in the need for coronary angiography and interventions with carvedilol and/or carvedilol.ACR+/. and-). )"
22932280," BACKGROUND Although iron deficiency is endemic in much of the world, the relationship between the severity of anemia and iron status in humans is lacking. We evaluated the effectiveness of iron supplementation of wheat-based snacks to prevent iron deficiency in women of childbearing age in Vietnam. We tested whether heme- and nonheme-iron absorption decrease in response to increased iron intake and whether iron stores reach a steady state. RESULTS A blinded, placebo-controlled, stratified intervention study was conducted in 192 women aged 18 - 35 y of varied iron status who were r and omly assigned to receive either iron supplements or a placebo.  Cognition was assessed by using 8  cognitive performance tasks  ( from Detterman's Cognitive Abilities Test ) at baseline ( n = 149 ) and after 6 wk of treatment. The mean hemoglobin and transferrin receptors in the placebo group were higher than at the end of intervention. The S and P groups showed a significant improvement in mean Hb, but not in mean ER.. The response of baseline iron status, sex, and daily dose to iron supplementation were not affected by the iron group ( P = 0.02 ). The change in iron status was greater in those who received iron supplement... the response of status biomarkers to an increase in iron supply depends on several physiologic and environmental factors, which make it difficult to predict the outcome of an intervention. CONCLUSION We assessed effects of baseline hemoglobin status, menopausal status, duration of intervention, and iron supply.. This study suggests that iron supplementation is an effective method to improve iron status.. In the present study, we found that the effect of baseline ferritin status, female sex, dietary iron supply, and the change of iron status on the decline in iron deficiency..

In 1989, the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in China ( Syst-China ) Collaborative Group started to investigate whether active treatment could reduce the incidence of stroke and other cardiovascular complications in patients with isolated systolic hypertension. The first period of monitoring began 24 hours before the first dose was given, and continued for 24 hours afterwards. A second 24-hour observation trial was carried out after 8 weeks of treatment.  Patients were r and omly assigned to 1 of 2 groups according to the modification in their treatment strategy : changing 1 of the drugs but keeping all 3 in the morning or the same approach but administering the new drug at bedtime.  Blood pressure was measured for 48 hours before and after 1 year. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 or older to a  BP goal  of less than 150/90 mm Hg, than placebo. The baseline prevalence of nondipping ( 79 % ) was slightly increased after treatment ( 86 % ; P=0.131 ). The ambulatory blood pressure reduction was statistically significant ( 10.4/6.0 mm Hg for systolic/diastolic blood pressure ; P = 0.03 ).. Angiotensin II levels were significantly ( p < 0.001 ) and minimally reduced by 2 hours after administration, but the night/day ratio was also significantly lowered after the intervention.

We previously showed that 3-d supplementation of resveratrol in type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ), and improve cardiovascular health and metabolic disorders. We hypothesized that supplementation with resveratrol would improve the glycemic control and the associated risk factors in patients with T2D. In this study, we aim ed to investigate the effects of a dietary resveratrol-rich grape supplement on the inflammatory and fibrinolytic status of subjects at high risk of CVD. : A total of 48 males aged 35–70 years with ≤10 % flow-mediated dilatation received placebo or resveratrol or placebo for 2 months... Plasma total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde concentration, protein carbonyl and total thiol contents, and a double dose of resveratrol. The control group received only oral hypoglycemic agents, whereas the intervention group received resveratrol ( 250 mg/d ). In both groups, the baseline and at the trial end, CRP values, lipid profile, and abdominal fat distribution ( assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging ).. The placebo group also showed an increase in the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase, triglycerides ( 9.19 % ) and a reduction in HDL-cholesterol ( 4.88 % ). We failed to detect significant differences in weight, BMI, total cholesterol ( -4.8 %, p = 0.05 ). The present study shows that resveratrol supplementation did not affect the fasting plasma metabolic profile. Although whole-body fat mass was not affected, abdominal adipose tissue mass tended to decrease after treatment with resveratrol intake compared with placebo..

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on vascular function and other markers of vascular function in patients with a history of myocardial infa rct ion. METHODS In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial. Healthy South Asian women with baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of < 75 nmol/L were r and omised to receive oral vitamin D3 or placebo. During 20 weeks of follow-up, we documented 4,843 incident cases of type 2 diabetes. Blood sampling for metabolic parameters, including fasting glucose, lipid profile, HbA1C, insulin, hs-CRP, 25 OH Vit D, adiponectin and leptin was performed at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS A total of 112 patients ( mean age 61 ± 10 ) with a mean age of 64 years and a baseline 25-OHvitamin D level was 38 nmol/l. The median within-subject change in total and LDL cholesterol in the vitamin D group compared with the placebo group was 0.13 ± 0.73 ng/ml ( interval 5 - 6.4 ) and remained higher at 16 weeks. In patients with vitamin D insufficiency ( < 32 μg/ml ) at baseline ( n =  92 ), 24-h BP decreased by 4.1 vs -0.3 mmHg, and 46 % were on antihypertensive treatment. A significant negative association was observed between serum 25(OH)-D levels and systolic ( 1.8 ± 1.3 % ), and diastolic BP ( 0.0 %, 95 % CI -1.4 to 1.4, p = 0.019 ). There was no difference between groups in magnitude of reduction in carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) or central augmentation index ( AIx ). CONCLUSIONS High dose oral Vitamin D supplementation did not improve blood pressure but produced short-term improvement in vascular and metabolic processes including endothelial function ( EF ) and insulin signalling."
31611148," BACKGROUND The effects of a low-carbohydrate diet on weight loss and the effects on metabolic syndrome are unclear. This study aims to explore the impacts of a very low-carbonohydrate diet compared to a high-fat diet ( LC ) on appetite-related hormones, and substrate oxidation in patients with type 2 diabetes. The primary outcome was the change in body weight, the secondary outcomes were body composition, and metabolic risk factors. In a parallel study design, ninety-one overweight and obese participants ( age 50.6 ( sd 7.5 ) years ; BMI 33.7 ( sd 4.2 ) kg/m(2 ) ) were randomized to either an energy-restricted ( 1 ) 6 day fast : considered as control group ( n= 11 ) ; ( 2 ) 8 day fast save for an isolated 100 g oral glucose load on day 4 ( n = 12 ). At baseline and week 8, 24 h urine and faecal collection s were obtained and a bowel function question naire was completed. Compared with the HC group, there were significant reductions in the LC group for faecal output ( 21 ( sd 145 ), which represented 7 % of their initial weight ; they began to regain weight after 12 months... The LC diet was associated with a mean ( SE ) weight loss ( 6.5 + /- 1.7 kg ; LF : -11.5 ± 1.8 ), whereas the DE group had the lowest ( P=0.014 ; SED : 0.62 ). The KD diet coincided with increased BMI, lipoprotein ( a ), glucose, C-peptide, and those assigned to the diet with 35 % carbohydrates. There was no difference in renal function, low-CHO and very-low-CHO diets on the current evidence base available from recent systematic review s and meta-analyses on low-CRA-/+ and .). )."
22935297," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of a pilot study that involves the association of a cue and a response. Three studies examined habitual automaticity in regard to different aspects of the cue-response relationship characteristic of unhealthy and healthy habits. DESIGN, MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES, AND RESULTS In each study, habitual automaticity was assessed by the  Self-Report Habit Index ( SRHI ). In Study 1 SRHI scores correlated with attentional bias to smoking cues in a Stroop task. Study 2 examined the ability of a habit cue to elicit an unwanted habit response. In a prospect i ve field study. Changes in physical activity as well as in the social cognitive determinants were assessed using self-reports. In addition, a process evaluation has been executed. RESULTS Sex, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived pros, different self-efficacy expectations, and habit strength were significantly associated with the intention to eat two or more servings of fruit per day.. The twelve-item Self-report Habit Index  was the most popular measure of energy-balance related habits. This measure characterises habit by automatic activation, behavioural frequency, and relevance to self-identity. Previous empirical research suggests that the SRHI may be abbreviated with no losses in reliability or predictive utility.Conclusion The results from the JUMP-in study show that automaticity is the main driver of habit-behaviour relationships. Because automaticity is an automaticity-specific behaviour patterns, the same procedure could capture habit-based behaviour patterns in self-report data."
28438641," OBJECTIVE Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) medication does not appear to be effective in ill, malnourished anorexia nervosa ( AN ) patients. However, it may be effective at preventing relapse after weight restoration. The purpose of this study was to determine whether nutritional supplements could potentiate the effects of fluoxetine in underweight AN subjects. METHOD Twenty-six subjects with AN participated in a trial of fluoxetine. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled manner, subjects received either nutritional supplementation or a nutritional placebo. The nutritional supplement included tryptophan ( the precursor of serotonin ), vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids believed to influence serotonin pathway function. RESULTS There was no significant difference in weight gain between subjects treated with fluoxetine or placebo and those receiving SSRIs and either aripiprazole or placebo, there were no significant differences between groups on mean changes in anxiety or obsessive and compulsive symptoms... In our sample we provide neuroimaging evidence for such a link, by presenting data on a group of schizophrenia patients who followed 16 weeks of olanzapine treatment and undertook a passive viewing task while their brain activity was recorded. In response to food-related dynamic stimuli ( video clips ), we observed a decreased activity in SN ( aFI and ACC ) after the treatment, which also correlated with ghrelin plasma concentration and a measure of dietary restraint. Taken together with past findings regarding the role of SN in both schizophrenia and eating disorders, our results suggest that enhancing the reactivity in the SN is the sole intervention in reducing psychiatric comorbidity including psychosis, hyperactivity, depression and anxiety. There are currently no FDA approved pharmacological treatments available for AN patients."
31344892," Background / Objectives : Previous investigations have demonstrated increased performance after the administration of a glucose-load on certain aspects of cognitive functioning in healthy young adults. The present study therefore examined the impact of eight breakfasts, in a factorial design, that contained either high or low levels of carbohydrate, on human performance. The meals were design ed to vary the rate of release of glucose into the blood stream. Memory, reaction times and vigilance were assessed 30, 75 and 120 min following breakfast. This study provides objective evidence that a typical breakfast of cereal rich in complex carbohydrates can help maintain cognitive performance over the morning. The G-WWB was evaluated in the postpr and ial period after breakfast with respect to effects on cognitive function ( visual search test, Stroop test and Sternberg paradigm ). The ability to recall words from a word list was greater if a glucose drink had been consumed, although not with fiber or sugar content. The possibility is discussed that higher levels of brain glucose are associated with better memory and attention. The findings of the present study suggest that the effect of High-GI breakfast on both the exercise and resting trials. Subjective hunger and cognitive performance were measured before and hourly after consuming the test breakfast via a computer-delivered battery. Ad libitum intake at a buffet lunch meal was measured at 3 h at the end of testing."
32161895," This study histologically compared the in vivo debridement efficacy of the irrigation system, EndoVac, and a step-back/ultrasound preparation in the mesial root canals of human m and ibular molars. In this prospect i ve r and omised clinical trial, 72 symptomatic irreversible root canals were selected. The h and /rotary group consisted of 15 teeth treated with a conventional irrigant. The group C used the same instrument combined with syringe irrigation of a 2.5 % NaOCl solution. The root canal fillings were performed immediately after canal preparation. The CUI group received irrigant activation using a Proultra Piezoflow ultrasonic needle for 3 × 20 s. The three groups were embedded in a gel containing the pH-sensitive dye M-cresol purple that changes from yellow at pH 7.4 to purple at pH 9. The irrigation was performed using a 30-gauge, tip-vented irrigation needle. In conclusion, the difference of irrigation was statistically significantly superior to 5.25 % NaOCl, irrigation alone and with final passive ultrasonic activation. The canal and isthmus cleanliness values were significantly higher than the control group ( P =.038 ). The percentage of root canal treatment with a nickel-titanium rotary system combined with ultrasonic irrigation was highly significant in in vitro and clinical studies. This systematic review aims to investigate the clinical efficiency of mechanically activated irrigants and conventional irrigation."
28003299," BACKGROUND The Diabetes Prevention Program ( DPP ) was a r and omized controlled trial, which showed that it is possible to prevent type 2 diabetes, and on diabetes incidence, in relation to changes in lifestyle. We assessed whether the lifestyle intervention had an effect on the ten-year mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in the DPP participants. We hypothesized that a DPP intervention modified for a community health center ( CHC ) setting would decrease weight and improve metabolic measures in Hispanic women with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Women diagnosed with prediabetes on a screening oral glucose tolerance test were recruited from a CHC. Participants were enrolled in 1986 and the intervention phase lasted for 6 years. In 2009, we followed up participants to assess the primary outcomes of cardiometabolic risk factor reduction was demonstrated in both intervention group and control group.. The median follow-up period was 30 months, and these beneficial effects had disappeared.. Compared to baseline, the 3-year cumulative incidences of diabetes were 55.0 %, 39.3 %, 40.5 %, respectively. The reduction in T2DM risk when excluding those who did not attend the initial education session was also non-significant ( HR 0.65, 0.41, 1.03, p=0.07 ).. Among the DPS participants who consented for register linkage ( n = 505 ), total mortality ( 2.2 vs. 3.8 per 1000 person years, hazard ratio HR = 0.57, 95 % CI 0.21–1.58 ) and metabolic time ( -26.9 vs. 22.0, -7.32 ). The incidence of diabetes was 4.8 cases per 100 person-years ( 5.1 - 5.7 ) in those with IGT, 6.9 for MET and 6.5 for LSM + MET. These findings emphasise the long-term clinical benefits of lifestyle intervention for patients with impaired glucose transportation.VC)."

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES Five metabolic cardiovascular risk factors ( blood glucose, blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and triglycerides ) were determined before and 15.3 + /- 2.1 months after  laparoscopic gastric b and ing in 650 morbidly obese patients.  Mean preoperative weight and percentage excess weight were 132 kg and 119 %, respectively.. There was no 30-day mortality and only one life threatening complication... The results of the analysis were similar for the two groups.. Preoperative BMI was 50±9 kg/m2. 33 patients were considered super-obese ( BMI > 50 ) . Mean operative time was 3.8 ± 0.7 hours. Mean hospital stay was 6 days. Complications occurred in 10 patients.. Mean weight losses in the surgical subgroups were observed after 1 to 2 years : gastric bypass, 32 % ; vertical-b and ed gastroplasty, 25 % ; and b and ins, 20 %. The accuracy of this categorical approach was found to be comparable to CHD prediction when the continuous variables themselves were used. In this case, approximately 28 % of CHD events in men and 29 % in women were attributable to blood pressure ( P = 0.04 ), but the hazard ratio adjusted for sex, age, and risk factors was 0.71 ( P=0.01 )."

To investigate the relation between backpack use  and back pain in adolescents. Method. The survey was mailed in June 2001 to a stratified r and om sample of 3000 Australian adults selected from the Electoral Roll. Demographic variables were compared with a 2-year post-test survey. The participants were videotaped in four conditions from an anterior view and from a lateral view. The prevalence data was derived, as were disability scores. The teacher attended the placebo group sessions. The intervention group, compared to the intervention group without any intervention, obtained significantly higher posttest-pretest gain scores for total alcohol consumption, risky consumption, and the Zung depression scale.. The program was successful in improving knowledge, but not attitudes, the  appropriateness of chair and desk height to student height. The differences in back pain prevalence rates could not be explained by the study design ( P = 0.00 ). The following were consistent predictors of the effectiveness of  school-based spinal health interventions  in terms of : 1 ) improving knowledge about the spine/spinal care ; 2 ) changing spinal care behaviors ; and 3 ) decreasing the prevalence of spinal pain.

24207135," BACKGROUND Several studies have shown the efficacy of prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) testing on prostate cancer. We investigated the prevalence of prostate cancer among men in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial who had a PSA level of 4.0 ng per milliliter or less. We report on the quality of life ( QOL ) outcomes for this trial. A total of 198 patients aged 75 years or younger with localized prostate cancer treated with RT ( PCS IV trial, Clinical Trials.gov, # NCT00223171 ). We developed separate risk scores for time to metastasis and CM using competing risks regression. We estimated treatment effects using Cox models adjusted for risk scores and identified an enriched subgroup of 75 patients at high risk of metastasis, and underwent a prostate biopsy. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Competing risk models were created separately for the radical prostatectomy and the watchful waiting group. The primary endpoint was overall survival. The results presented here are of an interim analysis planned for when two-thirds of the patients were included. The overall survival was the primary end point. Overall and cancer specific survival rates were compared between arms with Kaplan-Meier log rank test and Cox regression. CONCLUSIONS From October 2000 to January 2008, 310 patients were r and omized to 1.1 % and 320 to arm 2. The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer during follow-up years 10 and 11 was 0.62 ( 95 % CI, 0.45 to 0.85 ; P=0.003 ). The incidence of late prostate cancer was low.. The majority of patients ( 71 % ) and 500 ( 56.2 % ) of those with prostate cancer were diagnosed with the same primary endpoint..

18395982,". There are no national low back pain ( LBP ) clinical guidelines in Irel and, and neither the level of adherence of General Practitioners ( GPs ) to the European guidelines, nor the cost of LBP. Summary of Background Data. Myths about LBP that are ab and oned by health professionals are still alive in the public. The concepts disease and illness are meaningful and used consistently by medical doctors for infectious disease and somatic problems. The control group received the guidelines by mail ( st and ard passive method of dissemination ). The intervention group, in contrast, received an additional active training strategy consisting of 2 sessions with education, group discussion, role playing, feedback, and reminders. The group intervention was associated with changes in attitudes about use of physician services but not medication use. A secondary purpose was to examine initial psychometric properties of a proposed back pain Self-Care Orientation Scale made up of the original 11 items. For both SBA and NRP, medication prescriptions were consistent with European guideline recommendations, but not for referral for further treatment ( 39 % of SBA patients were referred on first visit ), secondary care ( 54 % of NRP patients were admitted on first Visit ), or discontinuation of work ( 50 % NRP patients on first GP visit ).. The average total cost ( direct and wage replacement ) for a single episode of LBP over 12 weeks was 20,531 Euros ( 20,300 - 20,762 ). Direct costs accounted for 43 % [ 8874.36 Euros, ( 8643.37 - 9105.37 Euros ) ] and wage replacements costs 57 % ( 11,657 Euros ). In conclusion, management of acute LBP in a cohort of GPs in IREL and was not consistent with EU clinical guideline recommendations."

A total of 110 patients with moderate to severe COPD were recruited from a specialist respiratory service in Northern Irel and. Patients had at least two of : emergency department admissions, hospital admissions or emergency general practitioner ( GP ) contacts in the 12 months before the study. The participants were r and omized to the intervention or control group. The primary outcome was the mean number of total hospital readmissions within 26 weeks of discharge. The secondary outcome was COPD -specific health status measured with the St George ’s Respiratory Question naire for COPD ( SGRQ-C ). The main outcome measures were the proportion of COPD patients readmitted to hospital and changes in patients ’ self-reported quality of life. The objectives were to assess the feasibility of this methodology, produce a sample size calculation for a full RCT, and to give an indication of cost-effectiveness for both pathways. The study showed that the average number of hospital admissions was −1.7 with a 95 % CI of −6.6 to 3.2 ( P=.49 ).

The study reported on here uses data from a social experiment to assess the association of r or omized to the US Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ). Of the original 111 infants enrolled ( 98 % African American ), 101 took part in the age 30 follow-up. Primary indicators of educational level, economic status, and social adjustment were examined as a function of early childhood treatment. The experiment led to a modest improvement in health insurance coverage. The others required up to 95 % coinsurance, and were hospitalized about one-third less often. RESULTS Significant employment and income benefits were realized among children who received vouchers , which were redeemable only if they had the same health status. The program had no significant difference in either educational attainment, health insurance, income, and family environment Improvements in these domains, in turn, lead to improvements in an array of behavioral risk factors and health. CONCLUSIONS : Social policies might not only improve economic well-being, but also health.. Health policy experts have therefore advocated for investments in social policies both to improve population health and potentially reduce health system costs. Since the 1960s, a large number of social policies have been experimentally evaluated in  the United States. Some of these experiments suggest that health outcomes, but not health. The HUD-VASH group also demonstrated significant improvements in health outcomes. The majority of health care providers are investing heavily in nonmedical social interventions in an effort to reduce health care costs."
31810222," OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effect of 2 % chlorhexidine on the microtensile bond strength of composite resin to dentin treated with three dentin bonding systems. MATERIAL S AND METHODS Flat dentinal surfaces were prepared in 24 extracted human third molars. Teeth were r and omly divided into 8 distinct experimental groups according to the adhesive applied ( Prime & Bond NT, Single Bond and Clearfil SE Bond ). In the 24-hour experimental and 90- and 250-day control specimens, we observed 5- to 6-μm-thick layers of DCM containing b and ed collagen fibrils. The dimensions of the specimens were measured again after each step and then stored in water at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The teeth were thermocycled, stored under the same conditions.. A nanofilled composite resin was used for all restorations. Bond strength data were analyzed at six months and 18 months using modified U.S. Public Health Service ( USPHS ) parameters. Interfacial nanoleakage was evaluated using a one-way ANOVA ( p < 0.05 ). The modes of failures were verified using optical microscopy. The specimens were analyzed with four-way analysis of variance testing. The 6 mo/18 mo overall retention rates ( % ) were 100/90.9 for MP ; 100/91.7 for SB ; and 96.4/92.3 for EB with no statistical difference between any pair of groups at each recall. CONCLUSION The 2 % CHX to EWB preserved bond strength to SD and CAD and was not significant for the etch- and -rinse adhesive systems. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the relationship between the bond strength and the type of resin restorations... Although the second % chlorhexidine solution, applied before or after acid etching, significantly improved the bonding strength of dentin composite resin restorations for different follow-up times."
24175602," OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of a structured exercise program on arthritis self-efficacy, quality of life indicators, and lower extremity functional mobility in older adults with knee osteoarthritis. BACKGROUND Osteoarthritis of the knee is a major source of loss of function in older people. We originally tested Fit and Strong! using physical therapists ( PTs )  as instructors but have transitioned to using nationally certified exercise instructors ( CEIs ) as part of an effort to translate Osteoarthritis Therapy into a community-based setting. A secondary analysis using a bootstrapped linear mixed-effects mediational model produced estimates of both the direct and indirect effects. RESULTS Adherence to walking was low, and there were no statistically significant differences between intervention and control patients at one year.. At 4 months follow-up, the exercise group had a significant improvement in the ankle stiffness, total pain, and ankle stiffness. The exercise group also had a significantly greater improvement in gait speed. The external knee adduction moment during the gait phase and the 6-min distance walk that were accompanied by significant decreases in knee pain. The study showed that the intervention group were significantly less depressed and had greater positive mood. In addition, trends towards decreases on fatigue and anxiety were noted. At 6-month followup, patients who received CST without exercise showed a significantly higher frequency of coping attempts and reported higher levels of pain ( P < or= 0.001 ). After 60 minutes of rest the serum levels decreased ( p = 0.003 ). The results of this pilot study justify the use of exercise programs alone or with exercise to improve OA symptom management and function."

This study was performed to explore the impact of sarcopenia on short-term postoperative outcomes after gastrectomy. Methods We conducted a large cohort study of patients who underwent curative resection for gastric cancer.  Sarcopenia was assessed by preoperative CT scans.  The sarcopenia elements, including lumbar skeletal muscle index, h and grip strength, and gait speed, were measured before surgery.. Patients were classified into four groups according to the sarcopenia, observational studies, and hospital stay. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the risk factors for total, surgical, and medical complications. Results Of the 682 patients enrolled in this study, 132 patients were identified as having sarcopenia... The mean time + /- st and ard deviation spent on total physical activity was 3.0 ± 2.1 h/d or 719 + / - 543 kcal/d, and 56.6 % of the sample participated in sports.. Surgical complications ( p < 0.001 ), nutritional risk ( NRS 2002 score ≥3, and tumor located at the cardia were independent risk factors of total complications, and sarcopenia was an independent risk factor for postoperative complications ;. The incidence of sarcopenic obesity was significantly higher than that of other sarcopenia ( p = 0.017 ). The prevalence of malnutrition was higher in patients with sarcopenia than in those without sarcopenia. Multivariate analysis revealed that only MUST ≥2 remained significantly associated with a poor long-term prognosis.. We aim to discuss the prevalence of saropenia and its relation to outcomes after GI...A. The impact of malnutrition on the outcome of gastrointestinal ( GA ) cancer patients is still controversial."
19366379," The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ). The authors found no placebo-controlled studies that have examined the relapse-prevention efficacy of citalopram in OCD. Twenty-one patients with DSM-IV OCD, with a Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive ( Y-BOCS ) total score ≥ 17, were r and omized to placebo or escitalopram ( at the assigned dose ) for 24 weeks. The primary analysis ( time to relapse ) showed that both drugs were well tolerated, with only one premature dropout in each treatment-group. The secondary analysis was that patients with OCD were randomized to receive either placebo, or placebo. The proportion of patients who responded to the 12-week adjunctive treatment with risperidone ( n = 20 ) versus the placebo group ( p = 0.001 ). The efficacy of risperidone addition. The mean ± SD of risperidone treatment was significantly ( p < 0.05 ) better than placebo in reducing OCD symptoms. The patients were rated as responders at week 12. This early response was sustained at all subsequent visits. At endpoint, there was a mean decrease of 8.5 + /- 0.7 ( 31.7 % ) of OCD, those treated with clomipramine had more anticholinergic side effects ( 15 % ) compared with placebo. A similar percentage of patients in both groups withdrew because of adverse events. The study suggests that aripiprazole treatment is most effective in treating the patient's symptoms and which is beneficial for maintaining remission."
27966571," Background : Since tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) has been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular events and mortality. The present study was design ed to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on metabolic parameters and on serum vitamin D levels in vitamin D-deficient type 2 diabetics. Methods This is a secondary analysis of data from a population -based, double-blind, placebo-controlled, r and omized trial. The study was conducted to represent the effect of supplemental vitamin D3 on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25(OH)D ), and the other parameters. The cohort included 1179 postmenopausal women who were enrolled to receive either placebo or vitamin D. The primary outcomes for the study were the baseline and after 12 weeks. The secondary outcomes were: Serum vitamin D, leptin, insulin, total adiponectin, and bone-specific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase.. The blood glycated hemoglobin ( Hb ), insulin sensitivity index based on oral glucose tolerance test, and lipid peroxidation were measured using SphygmoCor. RESULTS The two groups were similar at baseline in terms of anthropometric parameters. After 12 months, AI decreased significantly during the treatment period in patients received vitamin D ( p < 0.0001 ) and did not change in placebo group. In the intervention study, there was a significant and negative correlation between BMI and serum leptin ( P = 0.001 ), the insulin sensitivity and insulin levels. The change in BMI and insulin sensitivity were significantly lower in the vitamin D group.

12804478," OBJECTIVE The study compared the efficacy and safety of venlafaxine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, to placebo in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ). The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of concomitant imipramine, diazepam, and placebo. The study subjects were 18 years and older who met the DSM-IV criteria for GAD and had baseline scores of at least 20 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety ( HAM-A ) were r and omly assigned to treatment with either venlafaxine XR ( 75 or 150 mg/day ) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline to week 8, that was sustained throughout the 24-week study period for the 2 treatment groups. The secondary efficacy variables were changes in anxiety as determined by final on-therapy Hamilton-A total and psychic anxiety scores and Clinical Global Impression scale. RESULTS Comorbidity was high, with panic disorder and social phobia as the most frequently found comorbid disorders. The likelihood of remission was 0.15 after one year and 0.25 after two years. The efficacy analysis included 365 patients and the safety analysis, 405. The use of antidepressants for treating GAD may be advantageous. The majority of patients with GAD presents a high co morbidity ratio with major depressive disorder ( 62 % ) and dysthymia ( 37 % ). On the HAD anxiety subscale, venlafaxine XR, 69 % of patients treated with trazodone, 66 % of those with dysthymia, and significantly more efficacious than placebo. In both the last-observation-carried-forward and -forward studies, the majority of GAD cases were successfully treated. The mainstay of GAD treatment in past decades has been the use of benzodiazepine and non benzodiazolepine anxiolytics. The utility of venlafaxine XR and antidepressants has been demonstrated to be equally effective to anxiolytics for treat GAD.A.)."
23818412," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of a 6-week exercise therapy in the treatment of fibromyalgia ( FM ). The study comprised 58 patients with fibromyalgia, who were r and omly assigned to the exercise group or to a control group. METHODS We conducted a prospect i ve, long-term, the Fibromyalgia Impact Question naire, a Self-Efficacy Scale, and a "" knowledge "" question naire ( based on information provided during the educational sessions ). All were measured in 14 subjects with fibromyalgia. The primary outcome measures were the FFI, SF-36, tender point count, patient global assessment score, and exercise compliance. The follow-up examinations were measured at the start and end of the program, 6 months, and 1 year. The duration of both treatments was 8 weeks.  Pain was assessed in patients and the majority of hydrotherapy programs included either a strengthening or flexibility component. The severity of FM was evaluated using the FIQ, pain ( 8 % ), stiffness ( 53 % ), and cognitive function ( Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task ). There were no differences in anxiety, depression, and self efficacy after treatment. RESULTS At baseline, there were no significant correlations between the parameters studied and treatment outcomes.. The exercise group ( n=29 ) and intent-to-treat analysis ( n = 34 ) of these parameters were improved at all followup points. The mean incremental treatment costs exceeded those for usual care.. "
31228362," This study had the following two aims : To investigate the effects of acute exercise training on cognition evaluated by event-related potentials ( ERP ). Method : Two hundred twenty-one children ( 7–9 years ) were r and omly assigned to either a closed-skill ( bike riding or brisk walking/jogging, n = 22 ), or a control group ( n=16 ). Compared to the control condition, the exercise group engaged in 20min of combined aerobic and coordinative exercise on each school day. The revised CONSORT statement presented here incorporates new evidence and addresses some criticisms of the original statement. The study revealed that the amount of attentional re sources devoted to a given task decreased after high-intensity exercise compared with the wait-list control. The findings also suggest that changes in P3 amplitude are an inverted U-shaped behavior of differences in exercise intensity. In addition, no-go P300 amplitude showed the same changes as P3 latency. The behavioral and electrophysiological indices were simultaneously measured when individuals performed a Go/No-Go task compared with baseline. The modified flow diagram depicts information from four stages of a trial ( enrolment, intervention allocation, follow- up, and analysis ). The result revealed the increase in ERP amplitudes ( N200 : p < 0.001 ; P300. ), which was related to higher cognitive performance. The P3a ERP component evoked by infrequent distractors measured at parietal electrodes peaked significantly earlier during both low- and high- intensity exercise when compared to rest. The modulation of both the visual P3b-ERP component, and the later P3c-ERP components is related that exercise modulates multiple stages of neural information processing, including the frontal-to-parietal cortex region. The outcomes of this study are discussed in the context ofA.+).-."

25919402," BACKGROUND To evaluate the effectiveness of a hearing aid fitting program. The program, design ed for hearing aid users, and the hearing aid follow-up visits were at least as effective as individual visits in the experience of hearing loss. The 3 treatment groups were divided into two groups ( stratified r and omization ). The training group ( n=25 ), su bmi tted to face-to-face procedures, and control group did not receive training. Evaluations were conducted before and after training and included analytic and synthetic measures of speech perception, hearing loss-related and generic quality of life, and a class evaluation form. RESULTS No significant group changes were measured on any of the analytic auditory-only or auditory-visual measures of hearing aid use. The participants were assessed by three behavioral tests and one self assessment question naire. In a controlled study the intervention group ( N = 29 ) underwent a five-week rehabilitative online education in which activities for each week included information, tasks, and assignments. The results for the control group were found to be similar. The study showed that the auditory rehabilitation program could well be applied to the clinical routine for a majority of new and experienced HA users. The control participants also read the book, but they did not discuss the contents of this program with a professional. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS The study demonstrated that both short- and long-term outcome measures were successful.

27460044," BACKGROUND Vitamin D supplementation is suggested to reduce the risk of falls among older adults. This may be partly mediated by effects of vitamin D on neuromuscular function. This study tested whether adding a protein-rich food, ricotta cheese, to the habitual diet increased total appendicular skeletal muscle strength.. The aim was to conduct a review to up date requirements and to compare the results of two groups : the vitamin D + placebo group and the control group. RESULTS It has been suggested that vitamin D status or supplementation is important for maintaining or improving muscle strength and mobility. Subjects were followed for 6 months. The study results, however, do not provide consistent results. The number of falls per person and incidence of hip fractures were compared between the 2 groups.. Fasting blood sample s for 25(OH)D, PTH and calcium determination were collected ( n = 56 ) and then the study concluded in 2008... There was no significant difference in the strength of hip flexors ( SHF ) and knee extensors ( SKE ).. In the older subgroup ( ≥68 yrs ), the percentage of change in muscle strength was significantly higher than in non-supplemented subjects. In a sub study, 137 r and omly selected participants underwent serial blood sampling for 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, and low-density lipoprotein, respectively,. The results showed that the intervention group had significantly higher serum vitamin D levels than the placebo group ( 84 vs. 33 %, respectively ; p < 0.0001 ). In addition, there was no evidence systematic ally, including only studies conducted in older adults."

30165599," OBJECTIVE To compare the effects of a low-fat, carbohydrate-rich and a high-fat ( MF ) diet on blood pressure, and the influence of different dietary models on this equilibrium.. Twenty-seven healthy normotensive men and women were fed a diet high in saturated fatty acids ( MUFAs ) or total fat.. The study design was an ABB/BAA extra-period crossover study. Twenty-four subjects were r and omly assigned to a diet containing 50 % of energy as carbohydrate ( 6 % of fat ) and 10 % as monounsaturated fat. After the intervention, the plasma cholesterol content decreased, whereas that of phospholipids increased in all of the dietary groups. The other group consumed the MUFA diet for 5 weeks followed by the SFA diet for 10 weeks. RESULTS There were no significant differences between groups other than decreased plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 ( PAI-1 ) levels and weight gain in the low-carbohydrate diet. The diet rich in monounsaturated fat compared with the other diets. The blood pressure during the last 3 days of each phase was similar between the 2 diets. Although the full-dose diets had no effect on lipid parameters, there was no significant change in HbA1c. The dietary study showed that a high degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower mean systolic blood pressure ( P =.002 ) and by 3.5 mm Hg (. ), but not diastolic blood pressure. The optimal macronutrient profile, especially the high-monounsaturated diet, was found to reduce blood pressure.

The outcomes of the 31 mm catheter-based TAVI ) were compared with the conventional surgical aortic stenosis ( AS ), and to further explore the potential impact of female sex-specific characteristics on clinical outcomes after TAVR. METHODS In March 2013, our institution was authorized by the Québec Ministry of Health to perform 30 TAVR procedures.  After thorough clinical screening and imaging evaluation, the patients underwent transfemoral TAVR, and subsequent surgery. The population was analyzed on the basis of access route ( transapical TAVI ). Clinical outcomes were compared between patients with and without CAD. The study enrolled 120 patients who underwent TAVI. The mean age was 76.8 years ( 61.0 % male ), mean body surface area 1.6 m2, and mean logistic EuroSCORE 18.7 %. There was no difference in all-cause mortality at 2 years between patients undergoing TAVR and SAVR. The incidence of new pacemaker implantation was significantly higher in the RBBB group ( 17.6 % vs. 2.9 % ; p < 0.01 ). At 1 year, total mortality was higher among patients with AF ( 30.9 vs. 5.1 % ), with no difference between the 2 approaches ( log-rank p = 0.33 ). Vascular complications ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 2.14, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.43–3.90 ; P=0.0008 ). There were no significant differences in mortality among the TAVI cohort ( permanent, HR, 2.47 ; 95 % CI, 1.40–4.83 ).

17054183," BACKGROUND The relationship between infant feeding and childhood asthma is controversial. This study tested the hypothesis that the effect of feeding different infant formulas on the incidence of  allergic disease in children. We have tried to find out whether avoidance of breast milk from mothers on an exclusion diet or an extensively hydrolyzed formula. The children were followed up to the age of 7 years. RESULTS The incidence of allergy was significantly reduced in the group with cow's milk.  Children tolerant to soy compared with their siblings and another nonrelated control group. The soy fed children showed transiently lower levels of IgG antibodies to cow's milk. A further 4 already had symptoms when fed only human milk. The others ( 6 infants ) showed symptoms after the introduction of soy formula... The majority of infants tolerated the diet.. In the cohort, the infants were not associated with any adverse reactions to foods.. Children with allergy or food intolerance were treated with an acaricidal powder and foam every 3 months.. A prolonged breast feeding seems most rational for infants at risk of developing atopic disease, even if the present study did not show evidence of a prophylactic effect of milk or a hydrolysed protein formula on preventing allergy and food intolerance.. CONCLUSION Allergies and food reactions in infants and children are common and may be associated with a variety of foods. In our study, feeding adapted soy formula compared to human milk/formula-fed infants.."

31906372," Background Gut lactobacilli can affect the metabolic functions of healthy humans. We tested whether a 1500 kcal/d diet supplemented with cheese containing the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum TENSIA ( Deutsche Sammlung für Mikroorganismen, DSM 21380 ) could reduce some symptoms of metabolic syndrome in Russian adults with obesity and hypertension. Methods In this 3-week, r and omized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel pilot study, 25 subjects ingested probiotic cheese and 15 ingested control cheese.  Fifty grams of each cheese provided 175 kcal of energy. Blood pressure ( BP ), anthropometric characteristics, markers of liver and kidney function, metabolic indices ( plasma glucose, lipids, and cholesterol ), and urine polyamines were measured. Counts of fecal lactobacilli and L. plantarum TENSEIA were evaluated using molecular methods. The data were analyzed by t-test for independent sample s and Spearman ’s partial correlation analysis. Results The probiotic L. casei TENSISIA was present in variable amounts ( 529.6 ± 232.5 gene copies ) in 16/25 ( 64 % ) study subjects. Body mass index ( BMI ) was significantly reduced ( p = 0.031 ) in the placebo cheese group versus the control cheese group. The changes in BMI were closely associated with the water content of the body ( r = -0.570, p =0.0007 ) when adjusted for sex and age. Higher values of intestinal lactobacilli after probiotic cheese consumption were associated with higher BMI ( r= 0.383, p < 0.0305 ) and urinary putrescine content ( r=- 0.475.. In patients simultaneously treated with BP-lowering drugs, similar reductions of BP were observed in both groups. A positive association was detected for all parameters between HD and theplacebo group, and HD and LD ( besides pulse wave analysis augmentation index ). We show for the first time that supplementation with multispecies probiotic Ecologic ® Barrier favorably modifies both functional and biochemical markers of vascular dysfunction in obese postmenopausal women. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate whether the use of probiotics helps to reduce BMI and arterial BP values, before patients develop type 2 diabetes."

The dose of the drugs was doubled every 48 h to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure < or = 103.6 mmHg.. RESULTS : There was no difference between the groups in the duration of hypertension, neonatal hypoglycaemia, and hyperbilirubinaemia. No significant differences in birth weight ( BW ), ponderal index ( PI ) were found among the study subjects.. The mean diastolic pressure was significantly lower in group A than in group B. Maternal blood pressure was also significantly lower than the control group. The effects of antihypertensive drug treatments on pregnancy.. : Mild-moderate hypertension during pregnancy. The rate of induction of labor and rate of cesarean section for uncontrolled hypertension was similar in both groups... Antihypertensive drugs are often used for the belief that lowering blood pressure will prevent progression to more severe disease, and thereby improve outcome.

The intervention was delivered by telephone, and support for breastfeeding was addressed. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The goal was to compare the effects of a 2-year, r and omized, controlled study being conducted in North Carolina. RESULTS The intervention consisted of a face-to-face PA goal - setting consultation, a goal - using magnet, three to five personally tailored SMS/week and a nominated support person who received two SMS per week. The retention was 85.2 % at 12 months postpartum. The primary outcome measures were change in fasting plasma glucose and 2-h glucose levels on a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test between baseline and 13-week follow-up. Weight was a secondary outcome and behavioural constructs ( self-efficacy, social support, risk perception ) were also assessed. The effectiveness of this intervention added to usual care is to be compared with the control group. The study was conducted in the primary outcome was the proportion of women with previous gestational diabetes, which was assessed to the intervention. The number of participants who reach a postpartum weight goal and total weight change.

30086061," BACKGROUND : The aim of this trial was to compare the efficacy of the fast-track surgery ( FT ) program with traditional perioperative care. The application of FT protocol s to laparoscopic colorectal surgery seems to maximize the outcome of patients undergoing elective colonic surgery. Methods A controlled r and omized trial of 57 patients who underwent elective coloctal resection was conducted. The patients were r and Omized to either the ERAS ( n = 299 ) or the traditional group ( 114 patients ). Inflammatory mediators, immunological indicators, and postoperative recovery indexes were compared. The primary outcome measure was the surgical complication rate. The postoperative hospital stay, return of gastrointestinal function, and complications were recorded. RESULTS : The LOS was significantly shorter in the FT group than the control group. The recovery of bowel function, to complete mobilization and feeding, length of hospital stay ( p = 0.842 ). The incidence of postoperative complications and the hospital stay were similar in two groups. The ERAS group had significantly shorter hospital stay and less hospital stay. The number of lymphocyte sub population s was determined by flow cytometry, and serum interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein levels were measured. Postoperative complications did not significantly differ between the study groups.. The median length of postoperative stay was reduced by 5.5 days ( p < 0.001 ), the postoperative recovery rate was significantly higher than control group, and hospital stay was significantly lower. The serum IL-6 levels on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 in patients with the FO group versus the conventional group ( P<0.01 ).

28298219," Background : Prior studies of the association between physical activity and type 2 diabetes have focused on increasing moderate PA. Few studies have investigated the relationship between sedentary behaviours and mortality. We aim to investigate the role of physical activity in pregnant women. We utilised a central telephone r and omisation server, with computer generated schedule, to assess the proportion of time spent in sedentary behaviour. We prospect ively evaluated this association among 1240 Hispanic women in Proyecto Buena Salud. The Pregnancy Physical Activity Question naire, a cohort study in Western Massachusetts. The primary outcome measures were birth weight, gestational age at delivery, preterm birth and survival. The associations between sedentary behaviour and the outcomes were assessed by logistic regression, total PA, type of sedentary behaviour, and gestational age. We studied 111 women. Early in pregnancy, 32 % of women spent ≥30 minutes/day in at least moderate PA, and 13 % in late pregnancy. No significant associations were found between the duration of sedentary behaviours. The association between gestational age and total activity was not significantly associated with any outcomes.. In the cohort, maternal sedentary behaviour was associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes ( diagnosed with an oral glucose tolerance test and by criteria from the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups ). Compared to nulliparous women, women with two or more children were less than those with three children, the risk of type 1 diabetes, that is to say that they were more likely to be obese... The amount of total sedentary behaviour is a risk factor for premature death and adverse metabolic outcomes, but the associations with sedentary behaviour in pregnancy are stronger for women than for men.

The effects of testosterone treatment in men who have limitations in mobility have not been studied to date. We tested the effect of two and rogens, testosterone and its minimally aromatizable analog, and other and rogen-dependent processes. This article considers how to determine whether data from existing trials are conclusive and, if not, whether a further trial is justified. We measured the efficacy and omized testosterone, the serum testosterone levels, and quality of life ( Qualeffo-41 question naire ) in 51 men on a mean daily prednisone dose of 12.6 + /- 2.2 mg. Men were rand omized, to receive testosterone ( 200 mg mixed esters ), estradiol, and estrone ]. The study was stopped after a planned interim analysis at the time of 520 deaths.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a smartphone-based home service delivery ( Care Assessment Platform ) of CR. The study was performed to evaluate the impact of a pedometer-based program associated with a socio-cognitive intervention on the quality of life. The initial item pool contained all items from existing criteria lists. Subsequently, we reduced the number of items by using the Delphi consensus technique. Each Delphi round comprised a question naire, an analysis, and a feedback report. The  PEDro scale item hierarchy was the same in both sample s, ranging from the most adhered to item r and om allocation. The Web-Based Tracking Group received a Fitbit, instructional session, and follow-up call at 4 weeks. The comparison group received a st and ard pedometer. The final criteria list was calculated using multirater kappas, and the time spent doing light, moderate, or intense PA. The outcomes were compared between the groups ( P < 0.05 ). The intervention group was assessed at baseline and 24 weeks and included peak oxygen uptake ( PVO2 ), motivational readiness for exercise, treat, and monitor the outcomes. While exercise performance declined over time, there were significant between-group differences in peak VO2 ( 1506±418 ml/min vs 1393±341 ml/ min ; p=0.017 ). There appear to be no difference in PA..

29561067," BACKGROUND While antipsychotics are effective in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, they have been proposed as a risk factor for schizophrenia. A previous add-on trial with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) led to negative symptom reductions in chronic patients. We aim to study the effect of oral vitamin C with placebo on the symptoms and neurocognition in first-episode schizophrenia. The study was designed as a 12-week, parallel-group, single blind, r and omized controlled trial of an adjunctive dietary intervention in patients with schizophrenia.. The primary outcome measures were schizophrenia, psychotic disorders other than schizophrenia, and nonpsychotic disorders as diagnosed by age 31 years. The control condition comprised a placebo and vitamin C group of 20 each. Serum MDA and plasma ascorbic acid were assessed at baseline, both live and with video records, and on days 3, 7, 10 and 14. RESULTS : The mean improvement in negative symptoms for the placebo group was 9.2 and the group compared with those consuming the single nutrient, but the difference was not significant. The majority of the individuals from the omega-3 group did not show significant improvement ( p =.024 ) and improvements in total plasma antioxidant capacity ( p<0.001 ). Of the 33 participants, 19/21(90 % ), had the greatest improvement in PANSS negative subscale score than those on placebo. For all three outcome measures, no systematic evaluation of these treatments, including those that were used alone, was conducted..

PATIENTS Subjects had total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) for hip osteoarthritis ( hip-OA ) without prior rehabilitation, or cardiopulmonary, neurological, or cognitive problems. RESULTS Twenty-three subjects ( mean age 63.4 years ; mean post-THA period 793 days, 6 to 48 months ) were divided into 3 groups matching with age, gender, and postoperative periods. INTERVENTION The center-based group completed an 8-week targeted exercise program while under the direct supervision of a physiotherapist. These were administered to a construction sample, comprising hospital patients, and community members chosen at r and om. Final construction was through an iterative process of factor and reliability analyses. The AQoL measures 5 dimensions : illness, independent living, social relationships, and knee extensor muscle torque.. The reliability of the total ( summed ) score was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICC [ 1,1 ] ). Structural equation modeling explored its internal structure ; the 6-m walk test and a patient evaluation question naire. The ICC for the investigator was 0.4 with investigator assessment of disease status reported on a 0 to 4 Likert scale. Of note, the estimated MPCI for both the WOMAC and investigator globals were similar irrespective of treatment, sex, age, or geographic region. CONCLUSION In this analysis, mean changes of roughly 9 to 12 mm ( 100 mm normalized VAS ) on WOMAC scales were perceptible changes to patients with hip and knee OA.

22852063," The effects of a zinc supplement on maternal zinc status and milk zinc concentrations through > or = 7 mo of lactation were examined... The effects on zinc homeostasis of a low zinc intake during pregnancy and lactation were measured in 47 pregnant Peruvian women during the third trimester of pregnancy ( 33 + /- 1 wk gestation ). Of these 47 women, 30 received daily zinc supplements  from wk 10 - 24 of pregnancy until delivery.. Individual zinc concentrations in milk were measured. The 20-mg supplement had no effect on the parameters measured. In contrast, 40 mg increased the maternal serum zinc concentration by 2 months and then decreased through 6 mo. The remaining 17 women [ unsupplemented control group ( C ) ] received no prenatal supplementation.  Zinc concentrations were calculated in plasma, urine and cord blood, and percentage zinc absorption was determined following dosing. The mean dietary zinc intake was low ( about one-tenth of RDA ), but it seemed to be adequate ; the serum concentrations of the infants were stable after the age of 2 months.. Similar controlled intervention trials in less well-nourished population s will be required to assess the impact of maternal zinc intakes on pregnancy outcomes. The infant serum zinc concentrations were channeled, but they were also influenced by the zinc intake.. Maternal zinc supplementation  in pregnancy was negatively correlated with alkaline phosphatase activity and plasma zinc concentrations, along with making homeostatic adjustments in zinc utilization. Although severe zinc deficiency during pregnancy has devastating effects, maternal zinc intake, and zinc supplementation. Potential homeostatic adjustments include changes in circulating zinc, increased urinary zinc excsorption, decreased zinc losses, and changes in whole body zinc kinetics. The specific questions addressed are the following : How is zinc uptake altered during pregnancy or lactation? Are those homeostatic adjustments influenced by dietary zinc status, dietary zinc, or zinc supplementation?"
25843244," BACKGROUND : The relation between cigarette smoking and several malignancies is still unclear. We examined the association of financial incentives to improve smoking cessation in overweight subjects participating in a behavioral weight loss program. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the relationship between levels of physical activity during work, leisure time, cycling to work, and sports participation and all-cause mortality. RESULTS Prospect i ve cohort study of 11,663 men aged 40–64 years who were examined in the late 1960s and then followed up for a maximum of 38 years.. This review aims to estimate whether : i. financial incentives achieve sustained changes in smoking, eating, alcohol consumption and physical activity ; ii. effectiveness is modified by ( a ) the target behavior, ( b ) incentive value and attainment certainty, ( c ) recipients'deprivation level. The response rates were higher among those offered incentives than those without ( 19.8 % vs. 16.5 %, P =.012 ). The study also showed that the level of exercise needed to achieve sustained improvements in health-related behaviors that would reduce the fast-growing global non-communicable disease burden. CONCLUSION : Both an employer directed low-cost educational program and small monetary incentives similarly lowered smoking, though not by the other, the 12-week postpartum assessment ( 24 % versus 3 % ). Although results are statistically significant, there is still no proven, practical treatment for smoking in advanced COPD."

29336593," BACKGROUND Anemia is a major public health problem in developing countries and may affect children with vitamin A deficiency. We sought to determine the effects of vitamin A and iron supplementation on the quality of life of children with anemia. The study was designed to assess the effect of vitamin C and vitamin A supplementation on hemoglobin and iron status in children. The children were divided into two groups. The baseline data of a randomized controlled trial were analyzed.. Children with a hemoglobin level of 80 - 120 g/L were entered into a double-blinded design for 6 wk.  Hemoglobin ( Hb ), serum ferritin ( SF ) and serum transferrin receptor ( sTfR ) were measured at baseline and at follow-up.. The effect of the supplement was assessed after 3 months of receiving the supplements. At baseline, 5 mo, and 10 mo, hemoglobin, and EPO were measured. The outcomes were also assessed in a comparison group of nonnightblind pregnant women. The mean hemoglobin levels were found to be reduced, i.e., vitamin A status improved, but not in iron-replete girls ( P = 0.034 ). The total effectiveness rates were 93.94 %, 96.77 % and 96.67 % in the three groups, respectively. The average value of hemoglobin was the most effective to improve the serum level of retinol. The overall mean hemoglobin level was not significantly different between the 2 groups.. the group of children who received the placebo group ( P < 0.001 ), the incidence of anemia was higher than prevalence at baseline..

In this study, dietary trans 18:1 [ elaidic acid at 5.5 % energy ( en ) ] was specifically exchanged for palm oil, the monounsaturated fat diet, 20.9 % olive oil. The subjects consumed two diets ( 40 % of energy as fat ) with 41 % of fat as myristic ( diet M ) or palmitic acid ( diet P ) for 3 wk with 1 mo between the two dietary schedules. The trans-rich fat significantly elevated total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol ( LDL-C ), but not HDL cholesterol ( P < 0.001 ).  Dietary intake was significantly lower with the PA group and the stearic acid-rich diet, but did not affect the HDL total mass ( P > 0.05 ). The HDL cholesterol/Apo AI ratio was increased 22.0 % ( 1 - 117 % ) vs 96 % ( 71 - 109 % ) ( medians and ranges ).. The current results suggest that lauric acid, one of the principal trans isomers produced during industrial hydrogenation of edible oils, adversely affects plasma lipid concentrations. The objective was to assess the effect of substituting PO for other primary dietary fats on the cholesterol levels of blood lipid-related markers of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ).

30544168," BACKGROUND Low-fat diets are popular for weight loss, but their metabolic effects have not been well-studied to compare the effects of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet versus a high-protein diet on weight loss.. We r and omly assigned 132 overweight adults to one of four diets - Dr Atkins'New Diet Revolution, The Slim-Fast Plan, Weight Watchers Pure Points programme and Rosemary Conley's'Eat yourself Slim'Diet and Fitness Plan - against a control diet.. RESULTS Seventy-nine subjects completed the six-month study.. The diet was conducted at five universities across the UK ( Surrey, Nottingham, Ulster ( Coleraine ), and Edinburgh ( Queen Margaret University College ). The outcomes were assessed at 6, 12, and 18 months. The primary outcome was the change in body weight after 2 wk of diet. The mean weight loss was achieved by all diets ( 5.8 + /- 1.6 kg vs. -1.9 +/- 2.2 kg ), then an additional 10-month follow-up. The high saturated fat ( HSF ) diet result in higher mass concentrations of buoyant LDL I, medium density LDL II and dense LDL III, with no difference between groups ( P = 0.05 ). The diet only, however, increased the weight and body fat percentage..., the diet with low-carbonohydrate diet ( 20 % ) and the control diet ( 46 % ), while the LDL cholesterol ( 18.5 % ) was reduced ( P < 0.001 ) and increased to the low-fat group ( P= 0.01 )..

The efficacy and safety of diethylpropion ( DEP ), fenproporex ( FEN ), mazindol ( MZD ), fluoxetine ( FXT ) and placebo. To determine the most effective daily fixed dose which causes weight loss in nondepressed obese patients, we performed a two-arm, parallel-group RCT. We selected a sample of published RCTs with statistically nonsignificant primary outcome and with placebo.. We applied the checklist to 29 meta-analyses of r and omised controlled trials. The placebo-treated patients lost 0.6 + /- 2.3 kg.. With the 60-mg fluoxetine dose, patients lost an average of 4.2 kg from their lowest weight ( P less than 0.001 ). The patients who accepted drug therapy were put in the case group. The main problems were for items relating to appetite changes.. : The primary endpoints were changes in body weight and the proportion of women who achieved at least 5 % weight loss by week 52. The use of this checklist may be an aid to improving the consistency and reproducibility of weight control. The outcomes of fluoxetine, the experimental treatment was also thought to affect weight control, but this seems to happen through decreased food intake and normalisation of unusual eating behaviours.

21272751," BACKGROUND Treatment of hypertension with diuretics, hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ ) and their combination therapy is less effective than others as monotherapy.. We compared the efficacy and safety of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide ( hydrochlorothiazide ). We studied whether the OBP and 24-h ABPM responses to hydrochlorothiazide differed and, if so, the relevance of these differences.. Patients with an office diastolic pressure ( ABP ) of 135 mmHg or higher were r and omized to treatment with either hydrochlorothiazide ( 25 mg/d, n = 233 ),  hydrochlorothiazide  ( 12.5, 25 mg, or 50 mg ). The reduction in systolic BP was twofold greater with the thiazide than with placebo, to achieve a  BP goal of less than 130 mmHg. The mean ± SD of office diastolic ( -8.3 and -7.7 versus -3.3 mm Hg, respectively ; P<.005 ) and systolic ( -9.2 and -10.0 versus -4.6 mm Hg ). The mean day BP decreased from baseline to week 2.. Although HCTZ result ed in a greater reduction in 24-hour BP, only the mean diastolic BP ( P<0.001 ).. The association of NIF to HCTZ induced a greater ( p < 0.05 ) additional reduction of MAP-24 h ( 9.7 + /- 2.2 mm Hg ) than that produced by the association of HCTZ. The systolic and diastolic BP values were significantly and equally reduced with both HCTZ, this posttrial trend was a continuation of a trend during the study. The antihypertensive efficacy of TCZ compared with HCTZ is less well defined. CONCLUSIONS Compared to TCZ, hydrochlorothiazide is the most commonly prescribed ambulatory blood pressure ( BP ) monitoring tool. More than 97 % of all HCTZ prescriptions are for 12.0 to 25 mg.. and.."
26908700," BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : It has been suggested that probiotics may reduce the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) and all cause mortality  in preterm infants. We aim ed to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in preventing NEC. Probiotics modulating the intestinal microflora of preterm neonates may minimize enteral feeding. We design ed a large double-blinded placebo-controlled trial using probiotics. We evaluated a cohort of 6956 VLBW ( 401 - 1500 g ) neonates admitted to the clinical centers of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network over a 2-year period ( 1998 - 2000 ). The probiotic group were administered enterally 5 drops of a probiotic preparation ( Bifidobacterium infantis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Bifidobacterium lactis, containing 1 × 109 total organisms ). A neurological structured assessment was further performed. RESULTS : The incidence of feeding intolerance in the probiotics treatment group was significantly higher ( P<0.01 ). There was no difference in weight gain between the two groups. The majority of infants ( 70 % ) were diagnosed with NEC.. The duration of hospitalization was significantly lower than the control ( n = 104 ). Stool fungal colonization, an important outcome parameter was 3.03 ± 2.33 × 105 colony formation units ( CFU ), and mortality ( 5.1 % ). No differences were detected in terms of NEC risk reduction ( RR : 0.54, 95 % CI 0.21 to 1.39 )..Conclusion : Late-onset sepsis ( LOS ) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in premature infants. Despite various preventive measures, its incidence continues to remain high, hence the urgent need for additional approaches.. One such potential strategy is supplementation with probiotics..).-}A)+"
24323914," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of soy isoflavones on menopausal symptoms in women who do and who do not produce equol, a daidzein metabolite. MATERIAL AND METHODS A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 104 postmenopausal women ( age 54, range 30 - 70 years ) with at least 14 hot flushes per week, that their daily diet supplemented with soy flour ( Arm A ; n = 26 ) or placebo. The patients were voluntarily enrolled and r and omly received the raw material of Pueraria mirifica, oral 50 and 100 mg capsule, once daily for six months. RESULTS Of the 10 enrolled patients, 8 cases were completely evaluated. The modified Greene climacteric scale ( MGCS ) was satisfactorily decreased in both groups. The average scale was increased in the group of women. The levels of FSH, to be 26, 17, and 11.1 at 1-, 3-, and 6- month follow-up. The primary outcome was changes in menopausal symptoms, total cholesterol, and lymphocyte tyrosine kinase activity. After 2 y of daily therapy, all clinical chemistry values remained within the normal range. The mean serum estradiol was slightly increased, but the difference between the treatment and placebo was not statistically significant. There was a significant interaction between treatment group and oestrogen receptor ( ESR1 ).. The effect was not evident in any of the other treatments, such as hot flushes and night sweats, were very common during the menopausal transition. BACKGROUND : The efficacy, safety and acceptability of food products, extracts and dietary supplements containing high levels of phytoestrogens, are very common among women in menopause transitions. Some of these treatment is traditionally been used as a highly effective treatment, but concerns about increased risk of some chronic diseases have markedly increased the interest of women in alternative treatment. The most popular and effective of this treatment are foods or supplements enriched with phytoestrogen- and.."
20091582," BACKGROUND To determine the effect of a home-based self-management intervention for older adults with knee osteoarthritis ( OA ). The study was a r and omized, single-blind clinical trial lasting 18 months that was design ed to compare the effects of a single-session exercise program on pain, health-related quality of life, and the performance of ankle and knee pain. RESULTS : A cohort of 103 older adults ( age = 60 years ) with knee OA who were recruited from 29 general practice s in the United Kingdom. A total of 416 individuals, including 365 African Americans, participated. The mean age for each group was 64 years, mean years of education was 11.7, mean number of chronic conditions was 4, and 75 - 80 % of participants in each group were female. The outcomes were patient‐specific function ( PSFS, 3–30 ) and global perceived effect ( GPE, −5 to 5 ) at 8 weeks. The primary outcome was self-reported pain, and a minority of subjects ( 10–15 % ) showed residual or recurrent functional Impairment 1 year after entry. The motor control exercise group had slightly better outcomes than the general exercise group at 6 months. For pain, the study participants had statistically significant improvements in self-efficacy, disability, and pain, while the control group ( P < or= 0.001 ). The study treated patients with chronic pain. In the aerobic and weight training groups, both the exercise and physical activity groups showed a significant improvement in pain and disability in both groups. The CDSMP group also demonstrated better outcomes at three months and a small benefit at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS : Chronic musculoskeletal pain ( CMP ) is a major problem for people with chronic back pain, with a low incidence of recurrent pain...

29462641," The mismatch negativity ( MMN ) component of event-related potentials ( ERP ) is elicited by infrequent, physically deviant stimuli in a sequence of frequent homogeneous stimuli ( st and ards ). We hypothesized that the MMN is generated by an automatic ( attention-independent ) neural mismatch process with a memory trace that encodes the physical features of the st and ard stimulus. The  Developmental outcome was measured by Bayley Scales of Infant Development - I in 13 preterm and 13 term-born children at a mean age of 21.7 months ( ±2.18 ) and 18.5 months , respectively... Greater hemisphere differences were associated with improved communication and cognitive scores at 6 and 12 months, but decreased in significance at 12 months after adjusting for socioeconomic and clinical factors.. Auditory cortical responses can be used in intensive care neonates to help identify infants at higher risk for delays in infancy. The MMN amplitude at the age of 4 years correlated with the expected developmental outcome.. The auditory event‐related potential was associated with a negative displacement of AERP curves. Early learning capability, as measured by habituation, may be associated with an elevated risk for early cognitive functioning. This paper represents the first systematic review investigating the predictive power of AERPs on  cognition in preterms. ABSTRACT Prematurity is a known risk factor for later cognitive deficits. At present there are neither behavioral nor neurological tests available to detect those preterm infants who would benefit most from early interventions. Neurophysiologic methods, and more specifically, auditory event‑related powers ( AERPs ) are convenient tools to investigate early cognitive functions. However, the capability of AEPs as a prognostic factor for mental development in preterm infants remains unclear."
30395694," OBJECTIVE : To compare the effects of two social-communication interventions ( Responsive Education and Prelinguistic Milieu Teaching [ RPMT ] and the Picture Exchange Communication System [ PECS ] ) on children with autism. This study used a r and omized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a focused imitation intervention on child autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ). The study was designed to compare children with ASD. The treatment group made significantly more gains in the number of verbal attempts at post-treatment and follow-up than did the control group. The latter effect occurred only for children who began treatment with at least some initiating joint attention.. Significant treatment effects were found for both an observational measure of communication, language and global social functioning and communication were assessed from video-taped preschool teacher-child and mother-child interactions. Children who received intervention showed significant improvements in IQ, adaptive behavior, and autism diagnosis. RESULTS : Children with ASD often also have language difficulties, and about 25 % to 30 % of children with autistic spectrum disorder either fail to develop functional language or are minimally verbal. The ability to communicate effectively is an essential life skill, and difficulties with communication can have a range of adverse outcomes, including poorer academic achievement, behavioural difficulties and reduced quality of life. Historically, most studies have investigated communication interventions for ASD in verbal children. We can not assume the same interventions will work for minimally verbal children. KEY POINTS : This study aimed to determine whether the interventions used to treat ASD.."
21567221," BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an Internet-based exercise training intervention for patients with heart failure ( HF ). The intervention was theoretically derived from B and ura's social cognitive theory. METHODS AND RESULTS This was a r and omized controlled trial of a home-based walking and resistance exercise programme plus specialist nurse care ( n=84 ) compared with the control group ( n = 20 ). Participants were compared on self-efficacy for exercise, symptoms, physical function, and quality of life. RESULTS The primary outcome measures were the Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 Health Survey, the disease-specific Minnesota Living with Heart Failure question naire and the Motivation Readiness for Physical Activity scale. The social cognitive model explained 55 % of the variance observed in physical activity. Both groups were comparable in terms of age, coronary risk factors, severity of chronic heart failure, ejection fraction, specific laboratory tests, length of hospitalisation, medication and social support. There was no statistically significant difference between groups in the MLwHFQ at 6 month ( mean, 95 % CI ) ( -2.53, -7.87 to 2.80 ) and 12 month ( t = 3.77, P <.01 ).

22760566," BACKGROUND Iron-fortified foods are recommended throughout infancy and are frequently used beyond, yet safety aspects have been inadequately studied. We investigated the efficacy of iron-fortification of household drinking water to prevent iron deficiency. The study aimed to determine if a weekly intake of iron as ferrous sulfate ( Fe) and the other a nonfortified formula. RESULTS In a 9-month trial in Bangalore, India, iron-depleted, 6 - 13-y-old children ( n = 184 ) were fed with either a rice-based lunch meal fortified with 20 mg Fe as Fe/kg, or placebo. The prevalence of Fe-deficiency anemia ( IDA ) was measured at 0, 2, 4, and 6 mo. The percentage with low hemoglobin ( SF ), and serum transferrin receptor ( TfR ) were measured. At baseline, the prevalences of iron deficiency and anemia in the total sample were 73.1 and 100 %, respectively. At 5 mo, Hb and TfR levels increased in both groups, although the percentage of infants with normal Hb values was larger ( P < 0.01 ). The cumulative intake of food was approximately 80 % of that offered. A 12-wk daily regimen ( 68 % compliance ) was the most effective in improving iron deficiency, anemia, and biological outcomes. The utility of iron fortification of food to improve iron status in infants with a birth weight > 3000 g."

This study was to determine whether a community-based, group-centered public health intervention to increase physical activity ( PA ). A total of 48 adults with diabetes ( mean age = 66.1 years ) were r and omly assigned to either an exercise ( EX ) or a control group ( n=21 ). The intervention consisted of 12 weekly and 8 monthly sessions and targeted knowledge, attitudes, and self-management behaviors. The primary outcome was HbA1c. Secondary outcomes included diet, physical activity, blood glucose self-monitoring, smoking status, and other clinical measures. Subjects for whom exercise was deemed safe also participated in triweekly walking groups ( 60 min each session ). RESULTS The intervention group were compared using analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) and changes over time using repeated- measures ANOVA. The participants were 79 % of the intervention group and the comparison group showed an increase in PA ( P < 0.01 ) and cardiorespiratory fitness ( P = 0.05 ). The intervention had a significant effect on weight gain in the control group and increased type I ( 860±252µm2 ) and type II fiber cross-sectional area ( 7.0 [ 8.7 ] ). Significant reductions in waist circumference and weight were achieved for both groups from baseline to 6 months. Both groups had significant improvements ( mean difference [ 95 % confidence interval ] ) in physical fitness, along with other secondary outcomes for the study group. The odds of not smoking were 3.56 ( 95 % CI 1.11 to 11.45 ). While a number of clinical -based PA interventions exist, the benefits of PA interventions are limited."

30903209," BACKGROUND There is currently no consensus on the effect of dietary protein on bone health in postmenopausal women. The objective of this study was to test the association between dietary protein and bone mineral density ( BMD ) and the rate of bone loss among women. We compared the effects of 24 wk of consumption of soy protein and diet net acid load, using a 2 x 2 factorial crossover design. We studied the associations of protein intake as a percentage of energy with baseline BMD, the incidence of bone fractures, and bone mass in 96 women aged 45–53 years.  Protein intake was assessed using a FFQ obtained at baseline examination ( 2000 - 2 ). Lumbar spine vBMD was measured by extrinsically labeling the 2-d menu with (47)Ca, followed by whole body scintillation counting.. The total of 203 healthy postmenopausal women were given either 25 g of protein ( 18 g ) + isoflavone tablets ( 6 % ), or total protein. At baseline, midtreatment, and posttreatment, urinary N:-telopeptides and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase ( BAP ) were measured. There was no clear association between  dietary protein intake and BMD, and there was no significant effect of the protein intake on hip BMD... Protein-related urinary calcium excretion was found in women with a high intake of protein from nondairy animal sources in the presence of low calcium intake ( relative risk = 1.96 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.09 - 3.56 ). We found little benefit of increasing protein intake for  bone health, at least within the population studied.

METHODS Forty children of both genders, 4- to 7-years old, presenting Class I cavitated dentin lesions in primary molars were r and omly allocated to 2 groups. One group ( CRT ) received conventional restorative treatment using h and instruments and in the other one ( AP ), the same restorative technique. The root-based treatment was used to identify dental anxiety trajectories. RESULTS Two hundred and fifty-four children were enrolled, 53 % were treated with ART, N = 127 with conventional treatment, and 47 % with MIT ( minimal use of slow h and -piece ) techniques. Evaluations were done with a CPI periodontal probe to measure marginal defects and to detect decay. A pain assessment for the restoration procedures indicated that 80 % of subjects experienced no pain, 18 % discomfort and slight pain, and 2 % required local anaesthetic. After one year 90.5 % of children and 80 %% of restorations were followed up ( 11.1 % lost as a result of exfoliation ). The experience with ART group reported less pain than those from the CRT group ( p = 0.0037 ). There was no significant difference in COHRQoL changes between test and control. For all the children combined, there were significantly fewer impacts at follow-up in terms of the child and family domains and that the total ECOHIS, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.05.

The study was designed to ( a ) identify the prevalence of community mobility barriers and transportation facilitators and ( b ) examine whether barriers and facilitators were associated with disability among older adults with functional limitations. Method and Results : Fifty-two older adults were recruited from the community-dwelling older adults, who were r and omized to the STeleR intervention or a stretching placebo program... The STeR intervention consisted of 3 home visits, 5 telephone calls, and an in-home messaging device.. Participants also completed the Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ). Secondary outcomes included the depression score was higher ( indicating more depressive symptoms ) among participants compared with non-fallers ( t(213 ) = 3.32, p = 0.0011 ). The overall function score ( indicating better function ) was also significantly improved in both groups. Differences between groups were not statistically different. In a post hoc analysis when participants were categorized by the manifestation of baseline leg velocity impairments ( N=68 ), InVEST training produced effect size differences in SPPB that were clinical ly meaningful ( P=0.02 ).

29560832," Background It has been suggested that a higher dietary calcium intake might favourably modify bone mineral density ( BMD ) in postmenopausal women. The present study aim ed to compare the effect of calcium-vitamin D-fortified-milk, -orange juice and supplement in primary school children. Methods Two hundred and eighty-two postmenopausal women were r and omly selected from Hongqi Community Health Center, in Harbin City, China. All participants were followed up from 2009 to 2011. The mean dietary intake of the participants over 7 y was approximately 830 mg/d.. Both fortified-milk and -juice contained 100 IU of vitamin D and 500 mg of calcium per 200 mL package, were given together with the habitual diet for 7 days. At baseline and day−7, serum osteocalcin ( s-OC ), total-body BMD ( TBBMD ), and metacarpal cortical indexes. The exposure was energy-adjusted intakes of milk, yogurt, calcium, and the total body. During follow-up, the mean BMD at the spine at baseline ( P = 0.210 ) and in the lumbar region at baseline.. In our study, vitamin D intake was not significantly different between the groups. After 7 days, there was a differential response of mean ( 95 % CI ) serum 25(OH)D, which was found to be positively correlated with BMD, and negatively correlated with intakes of calcium and potassium and had high factor loadings for the whole body.. The study showed that the intake of calcium supplements was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, these short latency diseases ( HR=1.86 ; 95 %CI 1.17 to 2.96 ). The food groups included in our study were not significantly associated with BMD and BMC at 20 y of age. The relevance of dairy produce for  the diminishment of osteoporotic risk is still a matter of scientific debate."
26927924," BACKGROUND To identify the most important predictors of frailty, the frailty index, that allows a more precise assessment and monitoring of older adults. We compared the predictive validity of three self-report instruments for identifying frailty. The study was based on the first wave of the Survey of Health and Retirement in Europe ( SHARE, http://www.share-project.org ). Subjects were 574 older adults aged 65 years and older.. The frailty indexes derived from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures ( FI-SOF ). The regression coefficients were assessed at T1 and T2. We followed this cohort prospect ively. The proportion of women reporting disability increased from 22.1 % to 52.6 % throughout the follow-up. The mean total TFI score was 6.7 ± 3.1. Patients were followed for up to 12 months to determine how well the index predicted adverse outcomes ( death, institutionalization, and mortality. RESULTS Of the 1645 non-disabled subjects at baseline, 83.2 % ) were not frail, 749 ( 45.7 % ) was frail, and 25 had died ( 9.4 % ). There is currently no gold standard frailty assessment tool.

PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING 400 healthy volunteers were recruited from staff and students of  the Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, between May 1998 and November 1999. The trial continued for 18 months. INTERVENTIONS Participants were instructed to commence medication when they had experienced early symptoms of a common cold for four hours, and to record daily their symptoms, severity, doctor visits and use of other medications. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Duration of symptoms and cold episodes ; cumulative symptom severity scores after 7, 14 and 28 days ; doctor visits ; and whether participants guessed which medication they were taking. RESULTS 149 participants returned records for 184 cold episodes. No significant differences were observed in any measure of cold duration or severity between the four medication groups. Although differences were not significant, the placebo group had the shortest duration of nasal, systemic and overall symptoms,and the lowest mean severity score at 14 days.. Placebo-controlled trials in patients with cancer reported no benefit from oral Vitamin C at a dosage of 10 g daily ( 8, 9 ), and vitamin C treatment was judged ineffective ( 10 ). However, in vitro evidence showed that vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) was proposed as an anticancer agent decades ago ( 5 ). The role of Vitamin C to the oral or intravenous routes could produce substantially different vitamin C concentrations 30- to 70-fold higher than the maximum tolerated oral doses."
28676426," OBJECTIVE To determine the impact on a responder type analysis of using three published methods to obtain the minimally important difference ( MID ) on the conclusion of a r and omized controlled trial ( RCT ). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING Using data from an RCT of supportive-expressive group therapy ( SEGT-intervention ) vs. st and ard care ( control ) in women with metastatic breast cancer. Using a mail survey, we measured the MID of different physician specialties ( family medicine, internal medicine, vascular surgery ) for using propranolol  to slow abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) growth. We examined the relationship between small ( MID ), medium, and large differences between periods within pairs, as indicated by Global Ratings and differences between these same periods according to HRQL question naires. The results showed that the mean difference of 0.29 points per question in health status, and primary disease symptoms ( < or = 1 vs. > 1 ), LCS and TOI score differences ranged from 2.4 to 3.6 and 6.5 to 9.2, respectively ( all Ps <.001 ). Conclusion: The objective of the study was to assess the usability of minimal important difference - or minimal clinical benefit -of-life ( MCID ) for measuring meaningful changes in disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) outcomes in the context of treatment. Twelve-week LCS change scores for patients progressing early were 3.1 points worse than those of patients progressing later ( mean = -1.2 vs.1.9, respectively ). Similarly, the average TOI change score from baseline to 12 weeks was -6.1 for patients who had progressive disease versus -0.8 points for patients with stable disease."

Our objective was to investigate the effectiveness of an individual counseling intervention at the workplace on improving cardiovascular risk factors in male workers with impaired fasting glucose ( IFG ) or diabetes. METHODS We conducted a r and omized lifestyle intervention trial design ed to alter personal lifestyles among 123 industrial male workers ( CG ; control group, n=75 ; OIG ; one-year intervention group.. The intervention group ( n = 152 ) and the control group ( p = 150 ) consisted of employees having abnormal findings in at least one of the following items at baseline health examination : body mass index ( BMI ), systolic ( SBP )  or  diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, lipids, and fasting blood glucose. Evaluation was conducted at baseline and after two years. Primary outcome measures were physical activity ( total energy expenditure, during sports activities, during physical activity leisure time other than sports, and meeting the moderate-intensity public health recommendations ) ; cardiorespiratory fitness ; and prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms. Secondary Outcome measures were body composition ( body mass Index [ BMI ], and percentage of body fat measured via skinfold thicknesses ) ; blood pressure ; and blood cholesterol. RESULTS There were significant positive effects on the majority of lifestyle intervention items, physical activity during sports... the intervention improved the level of BMI, and cholesterol.. Primary providers replied to 76 % of nurse medication management facilitation contacts, 18 % of these result ed in medication changes. There were no between-group differences over time for SBP ( P =.11 ), HbA1c, and blood pressure.

The aim of this study was to determine whether a green tea extract, by virtue of its high content of caffeine and catechin polyphenols, could increase 24-h energy expenditure ( EE ) and fat oxidation in humans. : Forty-six overweight women ( BMI 27.6 ( sd 1.8 ) kg/m2 ) were fed in energy balance from day 1 to day 3, followed by a 6-week trial with placebo. In all three sample s, significant associations of the time spent watching television and the prevalence of obesity were observed. In a r and omized, double-blind trial, the subjects were given 3 g ALA/d from flaxseed oil capsules ( n = 31 ) or placebo. The study participants had no effect on mean weight loss compared with placebo ( -1.9 kg ), or 500 mg HCA and 3 g MCT ( P = 0.381 ). The number of people in each group able to lose any weight was identical ( = 0, p = 1.0 ). There was no difference in the weight loss during the 2 weeks of intervention ( PLA, -0.5+/-0.3 kg, P<0.01 ; HCA+MCT, −1.3 ± 0.2 kg ).. The average number of steps increased from 8950+/-3432 to 12764+/-4642 ( P<.001 ), whereas the GT group became more hungry over time and less thirsty, and showed increased prospect i ve food consumption. This study suggests that moderate weight loss ( < 5 % of body weight ) associated with the use of alternative weight-loss products'ingredients.

The effectiveness of diltiazem, a non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is less clear. The Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension ( STOP-Hypertension ) was a prospect i ve, r and omised trial to compare the effects of atenolol and eprosartan in the prevention of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) events and death. METHODS After a 2-week placebo run-in, there was no evidence of any "" threshold "" below which lower levels of DBP were not associated with lower risks of stroke and of CHD.. The primary endpoint was death.. Secondary endpoints were death, stroke, and the composite of cardiac mortality and morbidity.. Patients were followed up prospect ively at 4 months, 12 months, and 5 years after the index event. The mean follow-up for the patients and their relatives was 6.1 months.. Data were available for 98 % of the cohort at 5 years, by which time 199 patients ( 58%) had died and 52 ( 15 % ) had experienced a recurrent stroke, 12 ( 23 % ) of which were fatal within 28 days. The 5-year cumulative risk of first recurrent stroke was 22.5 % ( 95 % confidence limits [ CL ], 16.8 %, 28.1 % ). The risk of recurrent stroke tended to be reduced significantly after 1.00, 95 % CI 0.87 - 1.15, p=0.49 ).. One of these approaches is the prescription of beta-blockers that have effects beyond the reduction of blood pressure, which can reduce the recurrence of stroke. BACKGROUND Stroke has a high rate of recurrence, but therefore secondary prevention is also important. Many clinical approaches to control stroke recurrence and for reducing death and major vascular events in people with a previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack ( TIA ), to determine their efficacy.

19588353," The Hypertension Optimal Treatment ( HOT ) Study is a prospect i ve, r and omized trial which will be conducted in some 20 countries. The main aim is to evaluate the relationship between three levels of target diastolic blood pressure ( BP ) control and various outcomes that should not be causally affected by statin exposure. The combined results demonstrate positive, continuous, and apparently independent associations, with no significant heterogeneity of effect among different studies.. The mean blood pressure at entry to the study was 160/94 mmHg, there was no evidence of any "" threshold "" below which lower levels of DBP were not associated with lower risks of stroke and of CHD. Methods and results The 18 790 patients were stratified as : medium/high – very high global cardiovascular risk ; men/women ; older/younger ; current smokers/non-smokers ; higher/lower serum creatinine.. New guidelines are recommending BP targets lower than this st and ard. It is not known whether attempting to achieve the target BP level in the low and usual BP groups was associated with the same mortality and morbidity. CONCLUSIONS When treating elevated blood pressure, we found that the mean BP values ( < /= 135/85 mmHg ) were associated with a lower risk of death and hospitalization. The average difference in MAP between groups was 6 mm Hg. After the first year of antihypertensive treatment, the group with an increase in systolic and a decrease in diastolic BP presented the highest relative risk of mortality. The group with no changes in either systolic or diastolic BP ( RR 1.71 - 2.67 ; 95 % confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.89 ).

This study investigates the long-term ( 12-month ) benefits of BGAT. We conducted a prospective cohort study.. The study included patients with diabetes... We used a controlled clinical trial of insulin lispro and regular human insulin was performed in 14 patients with T1DM. At 6 months and 1 month before BGAT, the patients were r and omly assigned to one of three groups.. During the lead-in and treatment periods, subjects were assessed for their hypoglycaemia awareness status and whether in their view their ability to obtain or retain employment had been adversely affected by having diabetes. RESULTS The median baseline and follow-up HbA1c values were available for 6.7 mmol/l ( mean ± SEM ) and had decreased to 7.3 %. At 2.2 mmol/L, subjects wore the CGMS for 2 months, and a modified HYPO-Score was repeated. In the subjects, 39 % had a slightly lower total hypoglycaemic episode ( 6.9 % ), with a higher mean fall of 0.44 % from baseline insulin level.

23482592," BACKGROUND Obesity is associated with increased mortality. The effects of a weight-loss program on overall and cause-specific mortality are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between lifestyle and health with reproductive hormones in obese men from different countries of the European Union. We hypothesized that modifying these factors with a lifestyle-intervention program or the administration of metformin would prevent or delay the development of diabetes. METHODS We prospect ively studied 20 obese men ( body mass index : > 35 and < 55 ) with recently diagnosed ( < 6 months ) OSA and an apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ). Both groups were followed for 8 months, i.e., 22 weeks after the active weight loss in the treatment group. The outcome measures ( weight, sex hormones, total intake of fat, and metabolic variables ) were obtained at baseline and at three time-points during follow-up. RESULTS : All patients underwent International Index of Erectile Function ( IIEF)-5 question naire, and lower TT ( -5.09 nmol/liter ) and FT ( -53.72 pmol/liter )). The incidence of diabetes was 11.0, 7.8, and 4.8 %, respectively. In both sexes, the weight losses from baseline were significantly increased for both the bench press ( + 19.6 % ) and squat exercise ( + 32.7 % ). The lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence of both diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas group B. The negative relationship between BMI and testosterone levels was observed in men but not in women. The BMI reductions between times 0 and 2 were 24.7 ( p < 0.0001 ) and 6 % reported severe testosterone deficiency.

14583958," The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of smoking and smoking cessation on the risk of death after an acute myocardial infa rct ion. The study consisted of male patients under the age of 65 years old with coronary heart disease. The number of smokers in a  test score, number of cigarettes smoked daily, and serum cholesterol  were significant discriminators between the 67 men with and without smoking. The mean follow-up period was 35 months for those patients who died and 99 months for patients who survived. The mortality rate of patients who continued to smoke cigarettes was 2.9 % as compared with those who stopped smoking.. The overall mortality of the patients who were still smoking at the time of diagnosis was not the same grade d response for CHD. The main outcome measure was five year all cause mortality.. Since only a slight decrease in cholesterol levels was found in the smoking group, the magnitude of risk reduction when a patient with CHD stops smoking. Conclusion : The importance of smoking as a risk factor for coronary disease is beyond doubt, to our knowledge, the overall mortality rate was 58.2 % in patients with no smoking but was significantly lower than in patients who smoked. The significance of smoking during the study period was beyond doubt. The relative risk of smoking after the initial diagnosis was greater than those of smokers."
26356689," BACKGROUND We aimed to compare the clinical effects of different types of perioperative nutrition on the incidence of postoperative complications after colorectal surgery. We in-vestigated the effects of a carbohydrate drink, given shortly after surgery, on postoperative recovery. The study included patients undergoing abdominal surgery. The main outcome measure was the postoperative complication rate. Patients undergoing surgery were divided into two groups. The control group ( n = 39 ) and a drainage group with closed-suction drainage. The authors assessed the influence of age on perioperative complication and mortality rates in a large cohort of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.  As discussed elsewhere, age was not an independent correlate of major cardiac complications in this cohort ( 7 ). The patient's anesthetic care was st and ardized, and they were all given cefam and ole and metronidazole. In a double-blind protocol, their wounds were evaluated daily until discharge from the hospital and in the clinic after two weeks. RESULTS The incidence of bilateral lower limb deep vein thrombosis was significantly higher in patients with cancer than in patients without cancer ( 8.5 % versus 4.6 % ; p<0.01 ). At the same time points, mean corpuscular volume and hematocrit were measured.. The overall and infectious morbidity rates were significantly lower in no-MBP versus MBP group, 44 % versus 27 %, P = 0.001 ). Surgical-wound infections were found in 18 of 96 patients assigned to hypothermia ( 19 percent ) and remained unchanged with the use of antibiotics. The full study protocol included postoperative recovery after surgery ( ERAS ) and were significantly changed after the study.

28827256," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of a culturally appropriate diabetes self-management intervention for African American adults with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A prospect i ve, r and omized controlled trial of a psychological family-based intervention targeted at individuals with Type 2 diabetes and their spouses. RESULTS In the trial, 140 volunteer individuals with diabetes between 35 and 70 years of age... The intervention included group meetings to promote a culturally adapted Mediterranean diet, dietary behavior change, and a focus on emotions. The primary outcomes were changes in haemoglobin A1C ( HbA1c ) and blood glucose. Secondary outcomes included blood pressure, weight, functional status, self-efficacy, perceived cohesion, social network connectedness and diabetes knowledge. Results showed that both the individual and couples interventions yielded significant clinical improvements in primary and secondary outcomes. At post-intervention, 96 participants ( 89 % ) completed the study. The mean difference in the primary outcome was -5.0 kg, the secondary outcomes were glycemic control, social support, and total distress.. For the 174 ( 87 % ) participants returning for 8-month measures, significant improvement was observed in HbA1C. Family/friend support was significantly associated with eating fruits and vegetables and engaging in physical activity most days/week.. We sought to assess the effect of social network interventions on glycaemic control and quality of life. We found that the intervention group ( 6 months ) was significantly better than control group. The study also demonstrated that social support improved the outcome of diabetes.. Conclusion A family-centered, behavioral weight loss intervention led to clinical improvements and social support in patients with diabetes, there was no significant difference between groups. The social network intervention showed improved integration of patients with the existing networks leading to a greater reduction in HbA 1C.-.).A and-.}"
30666617," OBJECTIVE : The aim of the current study was to determine effects of probiotic treatment for diabetes and its associated complications.. The objective of this study assessed the clinical usefulness of combined probiotic and prebiotic therapy in the treatment of active CD. Methods : Thirty four types 2 diabetic patients aged between 25 to 65 years, and diagnosed with diabetes for less than 15 years were selected for this single- blinded clinical trial. Using balanced block r and om sampling, the patients were divided into two groups of intervention ( probiotics ) and placebo. The probiotic group received a daily capsule containing 108 colony forming units ( CFUs ) of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis with a total of min 1 × 107 CFU. The lipid profile, lipid accumulation product, plasma fatty acids, lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, adiponectin, and the antioxidant enzymes activities were analyzed. RESULTS In comparison with the dietary intervention group, there was no significant difference in FBS, total antioxidant capacity ( TAC ), erythrocyte superoxide dismutase ( SOD ), glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ), and catalase ( CAT ) activities were measured. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that a single daily administration of Bifidobacterium bifidum strain Bb can significantly modify the IME in healthy ( not diseased ) adults. No significant within- and between-group differences were observed for MDA, TAC, or CAT. SOD activity decreased only in  the probiotic group and GPx activity decreased in both study groups ( p < 0.05 ). Furthermore, several studies indicated that probiotic supplementation improved oxidative stress biomarkers  among adult subjects. Both CDAI and IOIBD scores were significantly reduced after treatment. Although, several studies have supposed that probiotics supplementation led to a positive effect on different health outcomes. However, these studies did not indicate the effect of probiotic supplementation on some oxidative stress markers  among adults."
26187342," BACKGROUND : The catechol O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) gene is essential in the encoding of cognitive functions. The dysfunction of this system is expressed in many diseases like Alzheimer's disease, dementia of Lewy body.. We hypothesized that levodopa would ( a ) ameliorate aging-dependent deficits in cognitive functions ( e.g., in aphasia therapy ). This study aimed to examine the effects of a dopaminergic agonist ( L-dopa ) and a dopaminergic antagonist ( haloperidol ) on the JTC bias and overconfidence in errors. The effects of training plus levodopa ( 100 mg ) on cognitive functions, a selective anticholinergic drug, biperiden, was compared to a selective acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting drug, rivastigmine, in healthy elderly subjects. RESULTS A double-blind, placebo-controlled, r and omised, cross-over study was performed in 16 healthy individuals. The results suggest that both clonidine and guanfacine facilitated PAL learning by improving “ frontal strategies, ” but only clonidine disrupted “ mnemonic processing ”. The negative effects on cognitive performance and trend effects on digit span backward and go reaction time indicate a mild sedative effect of haloperidol. The prevalence rate assessed by RRT was approximately 2.5-fold higher than that of the AQ. This popular topic attracts attention both from the general public and the scientific community. The objective was to explore innovative mechanisms of psychostimulant's action."

However, the effect of NAC on brain Glu levels in substance-dependent humans has not yet been investigated. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of NAC in the treatment of cocaine dependence. A sample of 1067 adults, 18 years and older, from all Australian states and territories, was recruited by r and omized.. Participants ( n = 149 ) had a Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Score of ≥12 at trial entry and, after eight weeks of open-label NAC treatment. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline on the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale ( PANSS ) and its components. Secondary readouts included the Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) Severity and Improvement scales, as well as general functioning and extrapyramidal rating scales. In the study, the primary outcome measures were the number of visits to CAM practitioners during treatment, compared between NAC and placebo. Overall, NAC demonstrates activity in reducing the severity of symptoms, with a good tolerability profile and minimal adverse effects. The annual "" out of pocket "" expenditure on NAC.. The current findings indicate that NAC can normalize elevated cocaine use in cocaine-dependent patients, there was some evidence it prevented return to cocaine use, total and differential leukocyte counts ( P < 0.05 ), and PANSS general [ -2.79 ( -5.38, -.20 ), p =.035 ], and the current study suggests that these beneficial effects might in part be mediated by the ability of NAC to modulate several neurological pathways, including glutamate dysregulation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The present study was undertaken to compare the effects of cilostazol, a new adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) receptor antagonist that inhibits platelet activation, and aspirin ( ticlopidine ). The study had a 4-week baseline step, followed by a 20-week double-blinded, r and omized treatment period. At base line, the viscosity values were significantly higher as compared with a reference group of healthy subjects. Patients with symptoms of intermittent claudication ( IC ) are at increased risk of cardiovascular events ( myocardial infa rct ion ( MI ) and stroke ). A progressive increase of maximal walking distance was noted during the three months of therapy with the drug. In both groups of patients C induced a significant decrease of blood pressure and an increase of PFWD, TWD, and WI.. The incidence of early permanent discontinuations of the study drug due to adverse events was almost identical in both treatment groups ( 11.94 % for clopidogrel vs 11.92 % for aspirin ). There were also a slight improvement of blood rheology in the clopidogrel and aspirin groups ( 0.81, 0.60 to 1.08 ), of which 64 and 65 were fatal.. There was also no significant difference in mortality. In conclusion, chronic administration of this agent had no significant effect on mortality ( P=0.31, 95 % CI : 1.04 - 5.10 ). In addition, there was a trend ( 3 % ) toward decreased apoB as well as increased apoA1, for the overall mortality.

The authors found that the population in | these villages was approximately 4,000, with an annual growth'rate of about three percent. In a double-blind intervention trial, 10 - 12-y-old children ( n = 310 ) in primary schools in two iodine-deficient areas in Bangladesh. The children were stratified by school and grade and r and omly assigned to receive 400 mg of iodine or a placebo.. All children were given a battery of cognitive and motor function tests and they were incomplete in summarizing the effects on this important age group. The current systematic review therefore examined the relationship between iodine and mental development of children 5 years old and under.. : The children, born to a mother with Graves'disease, developed transient hyperthyroidism. At the age of 9 y, the mean mental developmental index ( MDI ) score was 16 points lower for infants in Group A than for those in Group B ( p = 0.03 and 0.02, respectively ). The study suggests that maternal iodine supplementation markedly improved mental development in this population, but the levels of these children were still below normal ( odds ratio = 10.5 ; 95 % confidence interval = 3.9 - 34.."

OBJECTIVE : Probiotics modulating the intestinal microflora of preterm neonates may minimize enteral fungal colonization. A large double-blinded placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 69 preterm infants to investigate the efficacy of probiotic supplementation in preventing the occurrence of NEC. : The infants were r and omised to receive either a daily feeding supplementation with a multispecies probiotic ( L. rhamnosus ) or placebo for 30 days, and were followed up for 2 months. RESULTS : Infants were divided into two groups : Group A and B received a dose of 1.6 x 10(8 ) cells of B. breve supplement twice a day.. Outcomes included incidence of NEC and /or death after 7 days, frequency of proven sepsis, rates of feeding intolerance and duration of hospital stay. The 3 groups ( total n = 207 infants ) had similar baseline demographic variables, duration of parenteral nutrition, and rates of sepsis. The infants receiving an exclusively human milk diet had significantly lower rates of NEC or mortality... Probiotics  reduced median days of hospitalisation ( 6 days vs 3 days in probiotics ) ( p=0.018 ). The main secondary outcome was NEC.. The incidence of the primary outcomes were significantly lower than the control group ( 6.5 % vs 12.0 % ; p = 0.041 ).. In comparison between group A and group B, NEC was significantly lower in infants ≤ 1500 g ( 9.6 % vs 16.8 % ), the duration of hospitalization.

28531197," BACKGROUND Type 2 diabetes is a major public health problem in Australia with prevalence increasing in parallel with increasing obesity. Prevention is an essential component of strategies to reduce the diabetes burden. We conducted a cluster r and omised controlled trial assessing prevention of diabetes in adults with impaired glucose tolerance. We examined whether physicians ’ diabetes-specific treatment PDM preferences as well as their self-reported practice s are associated with the quality of diabetes care their patients receive. Methods : The study enrolled and omized to an enhanced st and ard care program ( one  NP  and one  nutrition session ) or a control group. The main measure in the intervention group is individual dietary advice aim ed at reducing weight and intake of saturated fat and increasing intake of dietary fibre. The intervention subjects were individually guided to increase their level of physical activity.  The control group receives general information about the benefits of weight reduction, physical activity and healthy diet. The average length of the program was 9.3 months. The primary outcomes were diabetes incidence, CVD incidence and mortality, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS The intervention was modest ( intervention : 14.6 % ; usual care : 13.2 % ) and attendance at individual consultations was high ( intervention ; 80 - 97 % ; control group : 86 - 94 % ). The risk reduction was related to the success in achieving the lifestyle intervention, the average weight loss ( intervention group vs control group ) was 0.614 ( 95 % CI 0.478 - 0.789 ), and this difference was sustained at the second year of follow-up. The overall incidence of diabetes was 7 % for intervention participants versus 11 % in control participants. The modest weight loss with metformin was maintained. Diabetes incidence rates during the DPP were 4.8 cases per 100 person-years ( 95 percent CI 4.1 - 5.7 ). Primary care is an important setting for diabetes prevention, for at-risk population, and for the delivery and uptake of type 2 diabetes prevention programs.. ."

Methods Single-photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) with [ 99mTc ] TRODAT-1 was performed on heroin-dependent patients ( n = 64 ) and healthy controls ( n= 15 ). The patients were r and omly assigned to treatment or the placebo. DAT availability was assessed with PET imaging both at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. DA D2 receptor levels were compared between the groups. : Striatal presynaptic DAT densities are decreased among type 1 alcoholics, and this finding is not associated with recent alcohol abuse. These studies replicate previous findings of lower striatal DAT of striatum and heroin craving or subjective anxiety. The exact pathophysiology of abuse or addiction associated with these sedative substances is not completely understood. The negative correlation of DAT availability with heroin use in both the right ( by ∼31.6 % ) and left striatum (by ∼33.2 % ).. The study showed that heroin addiction, like addiction to other drugs of abuse, is associated with low D(2/3 ) receptor binding and low presynaptic dopamines. However, neither of these outcome measures was associated with heroin craving in prolonged abstinence or in methadone maintenance treatment subjects.Conclusion : Use of alcohol, cannabis and opioids is highly prevalent and is associated the striatal dopaminergic systems of users of sedative substances, but currently these results are very heterogeneous..-). and-."
28854877," Background. The maternal mortality ratio ( MMR ) in Mexico and a has declined significantly during the last 20 years, but Ug and a is not on track to reach the millennium development goal of reducing MMR by 75 % by 2015. This study explores the impact of Zambia's Child Grant Program  on a range of maternal health utilization outcomes using a r and omized design and difference-in-differences multivariate regression from data collected over 24 months from 2010 to 2012. Results were collected in 2010 - 2011 and in 2012 among 2933 and 3094 women aged 15 - 49 years reporting 962 and 1494 births within two years before the respective surveys. Programme participation is measured by beneficiary status, programme months and cash transfers. RESULTS More than two-thirds of poor rural women delivered in a health facility. The Oportunidades conditional cash transfer programme is associated with better quality of prenatal care for low-income, rural women in Mexico. This result is probably a manifestation of the programme's empowerment goal, by encouraging beneficiaries to be informed and active health consumers. There was also a significant increase in the likelihood of facility-based delivery ( odds ratios [ OR ] : 2.04 compared with 5.6 % among non-beneficiaries. The financial intervention did not influence the number of visits, but was associated with increased caesarean sections and a decrease in many ultrasound tests. The interventions vary in design but have typically been used to increase health service utilisation by off setting some financial costs for users, or increasing household income and incentivising ‘ healthy behaviours.

24978932," OBJECTIVE To examine the relationship and differences between static and dynamic postural stability in healthy older adults. OBJECTIVE Before-after trials, with a 5 x 6 repeated- measures design. To date, no study has examined the effect of a fall-prevention exercise program on balance and leg strength in elderly adults. RESULTS Twenty-four men ( age : 21.6 ± 1.2 yrs, mass : 60.8 ± 7.6 kg, height : 165.0 ± 5.0 cm ) and ten males ( age ; 25.1 ± 3.0 yrs, weight : 63.3+/-7.9 kg ). For the fatigue condition, participants performed a repeated sit-to-st and movement, as fast as possible, until they could no longer continue. Participants then immediately began walking trials. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected on approach to, during, and after crossing a height-adjustable target obstacle ( 10 % and 20 % of leg length ). Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that fatigue was associated with a significant increase in all stability indices. The participants were analyzed statistically using the testing times being a repeated factor. No other significant between-condition differences ( P = 0.05 ) were observed for the other kinematic variables when negotiating the 10 % obstacle. The one-way ANOVA and post hoc comparisons demonstrated that a sample size of 40 was necessary to determine statistical differences in postural control. CONCLUSIONS The muscle endurance program provided a significant improvement in dynamic balance and fatigue of the frontal movers, but did not result in a significant difference in falls. The specific purpose of this review was to provide a detailed assessment of how anticipatory and reactive postural control tasks are influenced by traumatic brain injury and fractures and the No. 1 cause of emergency department visits by older individuals. Although declines in muscle strength and sensory function contribute to increased falls in older adults, skeletal muscle fatigue is often overlooked as an additional contributor to fall risk."
19808490," Background — Although implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) reduce mortality, many extrapulmonary vein areas may be the source of initiation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation. We sought to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the st and ard and newly proposed diagnostic ECG markers in the presence of a right bundle-branch block ( RBBB ). Methods and Results — Twenty-four young healthy subjects with paroxysmal AF scheduled for ablation to empirical antiarrhythmic therapy ( AAD group ) and 57 controls ( 21 men ; aged 40±17 years ) were included. Among the 100 patients with ARVD, a complete RBBB was present in 17 patients, and 15 patients had an incomplete RBBB.. The study was a 6- to 12-week open-label, multicenter, phase IIA study of 66 patients with the ICD.. All patients were programmed ( DDD-60 or DDDR-60 ) and evaluated after implantation and 3 and 6 months later. The primary end point was left ventricular end-systolic volume. Secondary end points included New York Heart Association class, respiration, blood pressures, and negative predictive value for identifying patients with any AF. The maximal esophageal temperature was significantly higher in patients undergoing general anesthesia ( group 1 ) versus patients undergoing conscious sedation ( group 2 ) ( 40.6 ± 1.4 ° C versus 39.6±0.8 ° C ; P < 0.003 ). The time to onset of AF was 7.7 % in group 1 and 21±9 seconds in group 2. The median daily dose ( for an individual patient ) to maintain an international normalized ratio between 2 and 3 was 15.6 mg ( P<0.001 )."
17488967," BACKGROUND Aspirin is known to improve the outcome of patients who have had a cerebral transient ischemic attack. Although both high- and low-dose aspirin therapies are effective for secondary prophylaxis in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease, the precise effect of aspirin to suppress platelet aggregation in women is one hypothesized mechanism. OBJECTIVE To examine the effect of oral aspirin ( 0, 40, 100, 300, or 500 mg ). The study was conducted to determine whether a 100 mg alternate day dose of aspirin given in regular and enteric coated formulations for a 2-week period is sufficient to inhibit platelet function in men and women. The primary end point was an in-hospital morbidity profile ; secondary end points were clinical and angiographic potency and hemorrhagic events. RESULTS Aspirin doses < 150 mg were prescribed to 29.9 % ( 6,128 ) of patients. The overall fatality was 0.15 %... The mean plasma SA levels of approximately 4 micrograms/mL were attained in 1 hour. The terminal half-lives ( t1/2 ) of aspirin and aspirin doses > or = 150 mg ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 1.06 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.94 to 1.19 ]. At the end of the 14-day observation period, we combined the control and DP groups to make a non-ASA group, and joined the ASA 300 mg and ASA group. The differences in the cumulative patency rates at 24 months were statistically significant between the three aspirin dosages, typically either 81 mg/d or 325 mg /d.. CONCLUSIONS To review the mechanism of action of aspirin. the clinical literature for relationships among  aspirin dosage, efficacy, and safety. The clinical efficacy of this dose and formulation of aspirin is adequate to fully inhibit platelet thromboxane production.. and.)... The data demonstrate that long-term aspirin dosages as low as 30 mg or even 300 mg may be adequate for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, particularly in/"
31645057," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and efficacy of an exclusively human milk-based diet compared with a diet of both human milk and bovine milk. Preterm infants have high zinc requirements. Several small trials have suggested that supplementing the enteral diet of very preterm infants with lactoferrin ( BLF ), an antimicrobial protein processed from cow's milk, prevents infections and associated complications. OBJECTIVE To determine whether the use of enteral nutrition ( MM ) or placebo ( n = 60 ) in preterm infants compared with the control group. Infants were fed either BLF or an exclusive human milk diet of pasteurized donor human milk. The major outcome was duration of parenteral nutrition. Secondary outcomes were growth, respiratory support, and necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ). RESULTS Birth weight ( 983 vs 996 g ) and  gestational age ( 27.5 vs 27.7 wk ), in BOV and placebo. The infants were fed enteral feedings. We attributed no enteral or organ-specific adverse events to TLf. There were 2 deaths in the TLf group ( 1 each due to posterior fossa hemorrhage and preterm infant death ). The incidence of NEC in group BOV was 21 % ( 5 cases ) vs 3 % in placebo group.  Morbidities were significantly lower in both groups at time of discharge from the NICU. The rate of hospital-acquired infections was 50 % compared with control group ( P =.002 ), and mortality rates were lower ( P <.003 )..

Many measures used to assess the real-world effectiveness and value of pain intensity, the numeric rating scale ( NRS ), and the 6-item PEG scale, and SF-36 Bodily Pain subscale in a sample of patients with persistent musculoskeletal pain. The purpose of this study was to compare baseline data from the 24-item, two 18-item and an 11-item RMDQ on 1,069 low back pain patients from six r and omized controlled trials.  Responsiveness was calculated using effect size, Guyatt ’s responsiveness index ( GRI ) and receiver operating characteristics ( ROC ). RESULTS : The PROMIS, PEG, and six well-known pain intensity measures were compared with each other. The global perceived effect scale ( GPE ) was used as an external criterion. The study showed that the VAS-D was more responsive than the other two pain scales. The  MCIC for the PI-NRS ranged from 3.5 to 4.7 points in the 2-week period due to a common pain condition. The WOMAC pain subscale was the most common ( 5.4 % ) pain condition to be compared to the PGIC. The mean difference between the NRS and VAS was not statistically significant.

28391233," BACKGROUND Although moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is related to premature mortality, the relationship between sedentary behaviors and mortality has not been fully explored and may represent a different paradigm than that associated with lack of exercise. We prospect ively examined the self-reported time spent by older persons on a set of sedentary activities.. We studied 6228 men and women ( aged 64.9±9.1 yrs ) from wave 4 ( 2008 - 09 ) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a prospect i ve study of community dwelling older adults. The authors identified 11,307 deaths in men and 7,923 deaths in women during the 14-year follow-up.  TV viewing and internet usage  were inversely associated with one another. Participants viewing TV ≥6hrs/d had lower grip strength ( Men, B = −1.20 kg, 95 % CI, −2.26, −0.14 ).. Correlations between activity reported in diaries and that reported on question naire were 0.62 and 0.59, respectively. Test-retest coefficients for the physical activity  ( > or = 6 hours/day ) and the sedentary behaviour  ( < 24.5 metabolic equivalent (MET)-hours/week ) were significantly associated ( P<0.05 ) with peak oxygen uptake ( R = 0.20 ), systolic blood pressure ( r = -0.18 ). No significant associations of  PASE score and diastolic blood pressure, resting heart rate, or percent body fat were noted. These results provide additional evidence to the validity of  the PASE as a measure of physical activity suitable for use in population surveillance of SB, using a systematic framework."
22851269," BACKGROUND Geriatric assessment has been suggested as a possibly useful approach in elderly patients with cancer. A comprehensive geriatric assessment ( CGA ) may help to identify more precisely those patients who are fit, compared to those who are vulnerable or frail. A phase II study was conducted to describe the role of geriatric assessment in oncology patients. A total of 364 cancer patients aged>70 years who were c and i date s of systemic chemotherapy between July 2006 and March 2008. The primary end point of these studies was the feasibility of six courses of chemotherapy.  Comorbidity was assessed with the cumulative illness rating scale ( CIRS-G ), functional impairment with WHO performance status ( WHO-PS ), basal ( ADL ) and instrumental ( IADL ) activities of daily living. Results : Overall, 73/110 patients ( 66.4 % ) were evaluable for response and 23 for toxicity.. The median age was 71 years ( range 71–87 ), and 68.1 % of patients ( p=0.002 ). The prevalence of being at risk varied from 60 % to 94 %. The mean of the geriatric assessment was not significantly different. CGA items were only associated with clinical outcome. The changes in the SF-36 scores from r and omization for emotional limitation, mental health and bodily pain ( also sustained at 1 year ). Conclusion The geriatric assessment is a multidisciplinary diagnostic process that evaluates the impact on treatment decision making, toxicity of treatment, and mortality. The goals of this systematic review were : 1 ) to provide an overview of all geriatric assessment instruments used in oncology that evaluate the older adult's medical, psychological, and functional capacity. No systematic review of those instruments in oncology has been conducted... ►A. The purpose of  this review was : 1) to examine the effectiveness of all geriatrics assessment instruments in terms of predicting or modifying outcomes ( including the incidence of toxicity, treatment choice, and.)."
16061898," The techniques of cost utility analysis ( CUA ) were used to evaluate the treatment of gallstone disease by open and laparoscopic cholecystectomy and by extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy ( ESWL ).  The application of the methods in this context raised three method ological questions which are not satisfactorily resolved in the literature. The first is whether an ex ante or ex post perspective is best adopted for the measurement of quality of life ( QoL ). The second is the method for converting a short term deterioration in QoL followed by full health into QALYs, but the reliability of that health, using all three formulations of  the TTO. The daily TTO appeared to be an improvement on the conventional formulation, correlating more strongly with health, eliciting re sponses that appeared that were more precise, and obtaining information about the value of health.

20459782," BACKGROUND To determine the effect of physical activity training on the physical activity and quality of life relationship. The aim of this study was to examine the association between h and grip strength  and 7-year incidence of dementia in older adults ( N = 424 ). We examined adherence to the LIFE-P PA intervention for the first 12 months of the trial. The participants were randomized into a control ( C ) group ( no intervention ), an occupational therapy ( OT ) group, and a resistance exercise group ( intervention group ). Assessment s of physical and cognitive status were made pre-intervention and after 6 months of intervention. Repeated measures ANOVA with Tukey post hoc comparisons constituted the analysis approach.. Moderate exercise showed no superiority over low-intensity exercise ; both groups improved about equally. The EHIGH group gained more lean mass ( P = 0.05 ) than the CONTROL group. The functional benefits from the exercise were not sustainable after these activities ceased and showed significant decline 10 weeks later. The training stimulus was three sets of four to eight repetitions of each exercise, total exercise, and gait speed. In a final model, the participants who reported > or = 150 min x wk(-1 ) of moderate activity demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in their Short Physical Performance Battery score compared with the control group... The outcomes were the absence of depression ( OR = 1.94, 95 % CI 1.10 - 3.42 ), having close personal contacts ( P <.05 ). Although physical activity may improve health, the improvement in gait speed was not significant. The study found that physical activity of healthy community-dwelling older ( > 65 years ) adults and the relationship between the outcomes of  functional limitations, disability, or loss of independence."
19433422," OBJECTIVE : The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the subjective report of concussion symptoms and neurocognitive function in athletes with concussion. Objective To evaluate the recovery curve of athletes who incur sport-related concussion. Methods and procedures : Twenty athletes ( N=72 ) were followed prospectively for the quality of reporting, internal validity ( bias and confounding ) and power, but also for external validity. Study Design : A total of 23 athletes were tested 2 days after injury. Postinjury neurocognitive performance ( Immediate Postconcussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing ) and symptom ( postconcussion symptom ) scores were compared with preinjury ( baseline ) scores and with those of an agex and education-matched noninjured athlete control group. RESULTS : The athletes with persistent trauma had significantly worse performance on the baseline test performance with respect to sex and to the total symptom score. Multivariate analyses of post-concussion data revealed a significant main effect of time on ImPACT scores.. The number and severity of symptoms were described. Conclusion : Athletes with concussion were found to have significantly poorer neurocognitive test results  and the majority of these players had a repeat concussion within the same season.. Using these data, the number of postconcussive symptoms and their duration may be used as a measure of injury severity and a guide for return to play."
22117033," Background — The mainstay of treatment for atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is the ablation of  left atrial ( LA ), this procedure is limited by a significant rate of AF recurrence. We investigated the efficacy of catheter ablation of AF  in patients with DM. Methods and Results : We conducted a r and omized multicenter comparison of these 2 treatment strategies on patients with paroxysmal AF, and PVI plus left linear lesions ( LL ). The patients were divided into high risk ( HR group ) and low risk ( LR group ) for AF. The primary end point was the absence of recurrent AF.. The following clinical characteristics differed between DM and no-DM patients. For CFE alone ( n = 34 ), spontaneous/induced AF was mapped using vali date d, automated CFE software and all sites < 120 ms were ablated until AF termination/non-inducibility.. After a mean follow-up of 13.8 + /- 8.6 months, 57 % of patients were in SR.. In patients taking statins, all four PV antra were isolated, followed by AF induction and ablation of all CFE sites. In the group of patients treated with ARB, there were no significant differences in any HRV parameters in the immediate aftermath of PVI, 17 of 18 ( 94 % ) were free from AF. Using Cox regression analysis to correct for baseline variables, treatment with statins did not predict the recurrence rate ( HR = 1.10 [ 95 % CI : 0.55 - 2.27 ] p = 0.79 ). We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to analyse the association between LA diameter and  AF recurrence after single circumferential pulmonary vein isolation ( CPVI ). It is controversial whether LA diameter can predict post-ablation AF recurrence to LV isolation ( CAPI )  and explore the potential mechanism."

The 2-weekly administration of docetaxel would be better tolerated than 3-weekly docetaxel in patients with this disease. METHODS Analysis of five consecutive Southwest Oncology Group ( SWOG ) phase II chemotherapy trials was undertaken. RESULTS The recently published results of a r and omized phase III study prompted an up date of this guideline. The median survival duration s for the nonorchiectomy and orchiectomy patients were 6 and 7 months, respectively ( P =.73 ). In a univariate analysis, orchiectomy patients had a significantly longer median time from diagnosis to first metastatic prostate cancer, enzalutamide, and radium.. Secondary end points were pain, prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) levels, and the quality of life. All statistical comparisons were against placebo. The overall survival was similar in both arms, the number of lesions required to assess tumour burden for response determination was similar to those seen during the 1-year trial in patients who continued to receive chemotherapy.. In most trials, early changes in PSA and /or pain were not seen in the placebo group..., total survival was not influenced by the doublet arm (. ).. The majority of patients with a nadir PSA level > 0.20 ng/ml, then 4-weekly until 2 years, and docetaxel ( 75 mg/m2 ) for 6 months were the same as the control group.

23499244," BACKGROUND Previous studies have demonstrated that electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) in the treatment of schizophrenia was investigated in a double-blind trial ; the clinical change after ECT was compared with that after a treatment procedure identical to it but for two exceptions. We studied records of schizophrenia in patients receiving ECT in one year ( 2005 ) ( n=101 ) retrospectively, as well as the consecutive data of patients between May 2007 and June 2008. The various indications for ECT in schizophrenia were studied by frequency analysis. Of the 202 schizophrenia patients who received ECT , the most common reason was ‘ to augment pharmacotherapy. treatment was given three times a week, with a minimum of eight treatments and a maximum of twelve. Clinical change was assessed by the Comprehensive Psychiatric Rating Scale ( PANSS ). The mean number of ECTs ( SD ) received was 8.4 ( 2.8 ). There was also a significant improvement in schizophrenia accompanied by catatonia, extreme depression, mania and other affective components.. Clinical improvement was compared using chi-square test, repeated measures ANOVA and analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ). Cognitive adverse effects were compared using t-test. The score on the global assessment of functioning also changed significantly ( mean 26.3 at baseline to 44.5 after 6 ECT sessions ).. The ECT is currently under-used in many psychiatric setting s due to its stigmatized perception by patients and mental health professionals. There were no adverse effects during the acute ECT course.

Although the advent of conventional drug therapies has simplified the treatment of anxiety in people with mental disorders, the effects of this herbal medication on the anxiety in patients undergoing m and ibular third molar extraction. Methods : In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial, 63 patients with moderate to severe anxiety of longer than 6 weeks duration were r and omized to placebo twice daily. Primary efficacy measures were assessed using the abdominal constriction assay and hot plate test. The anxiolytic activity was assessed during predose and 1-hour postdose completions of a 20-minute version of the Defined Intensity Stressor Simulation ( DISS ). There were no significant differences between groups in changes in sleep diary measures, including total sleep time ( TST ), sleep efficiency, sleep latency, wake after sleep onset ( WASO ), and sleep quality. The study showed that the placebo group had significantly increased self-ratings of anxiety tension and agitation, while the study group did not reach statistical significance. The outcome measures included a simple visual reaction test ( SVRT ), subjective sleepiness scales, SFST performance scores, and driving simulator performance parameters. In the current study, the anxiolytic effect was significantly lower ( p≤0.05 ) in the Treatment group ( 6.01±1.19 min ) when compared to the Control group.

31336032," This study compared the timing performance of humans on a modified temporal generalization task with 1, 3, or 5 presentations of the st and ard duration.  In the first two experiments participants received presentations of a st and ards at the beginning of each trial block and were instructed to encode either one or both of them. When instructed the participants were then asked to judge whether they then had the correct time- and event-based tone pair ( probing episodic memory ). As predicted, children between 8 and 12 years of age who were diagnosed with ASD  performed less well than age- and IQ-matched comparison individuals.  This observation is of considerable importance in the context of developmental theory because semantic and episodic order memory abilities can be dissociated in typically developing infants, they reach the age at which the behavioural markers associated with autism are first apparent. This raises the possibility that early emerging memory abnormalities play a role in shaping the developmental trajectory of autism spectrum condition ( ASC ). Studies and personal accounts from clinicians, parents, caregivers, and self-reports from autistic people themselves often refer to problems with time. Although a number of empirical studies have examined aspects relating to time in autistic individuals, there remains no clear consensus on whether or how these aspects may be affected in autism."

24683002," BACKGROUND In patients who have had a myocardial infa rct ion, the long-term risk of stroke and its relation to the extent of left ventricular dysfunction. The HELAS study ( Heart failure Long-term Antithrombotic Study ) is a multicentre, r and omised, controlled trial of oral anticoagulation, aspirin ( 300 mg/day ), and warfarin ( target international normalized ratio 2.5 ) in patients with CHF. The cumulative incidence of bleeding was estimated by means of survival analysis. The primary endpoint was the incidence of death. The incidence of thromboembolic complications and vascular mortality were significantly lower in the enalapril-treated group ( from 44 to 26 %, p = 0.002 ). We enrolled 1587 men and women ≥18 years of age with symptomatic heart failure for at least 3 months who were in sinus rhythm and had a mean follow-up time of 27 + /- 1 months. The monthly risk of major bleeding ( 50 % ) was found in patients dying from progressive heart failure. The estimated five-year rate of stroke in all the patients was 8.1 percent. The overall increase in left ventricular ejection fraction from 28.2+/-6 to 30.3+/-7 p<0.05.  Cardiovascular drug prescriptions were tested in a multivariate Cox model adjusted by other known predictive factors. The risk of death was not significantly influenced by the presence of atrial fibrillation, 0.89 ( 95 % CI.. ), and there is wide variation between the indications for aspirin. The death rate was markedly lower in patients who received aspirin, 17 % in 110 middle-risk patients, and 63 % in 20 high-risk individuals. CONCLUSIONS Patients with chronic heart failure ( heart failure ) are at risk of comboembolic events, including stroke, pulmonary embolism and peripheral arterial embolism, but the benefit of oral therapy is not established in certain patient groups, including patients with heart failure, and coronary ischaemic events, although there was no evidence of benefit of aspirin or other treatment in this population."
19270759," There has been much interest in the genetics of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ). The association between the dopamine transporter ( DAT ) gene and ADHD, we examined covert visual spatial orienting in ADHD and comparison boys, Study 2 comprised a dose-response study of methylpheni date for the ADHD group, and Study 3 was an investigation of biological and adoptive parents. In the present study, we investigated the association between DAT density using I-123-N-(3-iodopropen-2-yl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-chlorophenyl)tropane. We performed single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ), haplotype and linkage disequlibrium studies on 300 children. The 10-repeat allele of the DAT1 gene was associated with ADHD in a number of studies and appears to have biological significance. The ADHD group was sub-divided into those individuals with the two SNPs in TPH2's regulatory region ( rs4570625, P=0.049 ), and those with one or no copies of this allele ( low-risk DAT1 ).. The data suggest that the AD1 locus mediates ADHD, but not the other genetic variants. The results have been interpreted as reflecting a stronger anchorage of attention by ADHD children upon a cued location and an inability to shift covert attention easily to an alternative location."
24206044," BACKGROUND Previous studies examining the effect of green tea on type 2 diabetes mellitus  have produced mixed results due to their observational nature and qualitatively and quantitatively imprecise definitions of the effects of these compounds. The present study was conducted to determine the relationship between coffee consumption and the incidence of  Type 2 diabetes. The authors conducted a 2-week diet run-in period, a 12-week double-blind parallel multicenter trial was performed on 14 healthy volunteers, with a crossover design. We excluded case series, case reports, in vitro and animal studies. We administered a st and ardized capsule of Camellia sinensis compounds ( CSC ) twice a day. The subjects were r and omly assigned to either receive 1,500 mg of a decaffeinated GTE or placebo.. After 3 months, the body weight ( BW ), body mass index ( BMI ) and waist circumflex ( WC ) were measured. The mean difference in BMI was not significant. In the study, the level of glucose levels were higher after the intervention... The study showed that the insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) was used as the major outcome measurement. At baseline and after 16 weeks of treatment, there was only a 0.3 % reduction in BMI, a major source of caffeine, and lowered malondialdehyde. The changes were not significantly different between study arms.. We did not find a significant difference in the amount of coffee consumed daily ( 0 - 2, 3 - 4, 5 - 6, 7 - 9, > or = 10 cups ) were 1.00, 0.71 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] ), 0.48 - 1.05 ),. The results indicate the regular consumption of a GTE high in catechins led to a reduction in insulin sensitivity, and a rise in HOMA, and thereforeA-/+. and.,).). The intervention group showed no evidence of insulin sensitivity or glycaemic control after 6 months of treating with the--C or with a single dose of type II diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ), we conducted a meta- analysis to evaluate the impact of "
24772264," BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to compare the retention rate of a resin-based sealant ( Delton, Delton Plus and Concise ) and a conventional fissure sealant. MATERIAL S AND METHODS Using a split-mouth design, fifty children aged 7 - 8 years with newly erupted lower first permanent molars were included in the study. The authors performed fissure preparation with phosphoric acid gel on r and omly assigned maxillary and mandibular permanent premolars and molars from one side of the mouth ( Group I ) and performed air abrasion followed by acid etching on the contralateral two permanent first molars. The sealants were evaluated at baseline, 6 months, year and 2 years. In addition, Streptococcus mutans counts were assessed after the four material s in one permanent maxillary molar tooth. Results : In permanent m and ibular molars, Optibond Solo showed a lower percentage of retention ( 40.9 % ) than that of Delton.  Relative risks of caries in Delton-sealed teeth were significantly higher at 12 ( P =.025 ) and 24 months, in time, the preventive method most effective trying to counteract the onset. CONCLUSION The sealant retention rates were found in 20.06 % of RMGIC sealed occlusal surfaces, compared to 8.91 % for LCRB sealants. The results showed that placement of resin sealant, semi-annual application of NaF varnish, and annual application of SDF solution are all effective to prevent pit and fissure caries in permanent tooth, this method could be a good choice for fissure preparation before sealant placement for long-term success.A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON CLINICAL TRIALS OF DIFFERENT and. ).).

25632374," BACKGROUND The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25(OH)D ] and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) in subjects with high waist circumference. DATA AND SETTING : This study was a secondary analysis of data from a population -based, double-blind, placebo-controlled, r and omized trial design.. The cohort included 1179 postmenopausal women ( mean age 43 years, mean BMI 32 kg/m2 ).. There were no significant differences in body weight or fat mass change between the placebo and the calcium-supplemented groups (. ). The treatment groups consumed three 240-mL glasses of OJ ( regular or lite ) or placebo.. In the first trial, body weight remained stable for both groups throughout the maintenance study. The high dairy diet result ed in decreases in total body fat ( 2.16 kg ), trunk fat ( 1.03 kg, p < 0.01 ) and with 2-h postload glycemia ( r = -0.29 ), and a percentage ratio to fat-free mass ( FFM ). In older adults, there was no significant change in weight, waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR ) or percentage of triceps fat decreased ( P = 0.001 ). During the weight-reducing programme, a calcium+D supplementation was necessary in female overweight/obese very low-calcium consumers to reach significant fat mass loss that seemed to be partly explained by a decrease in serum vitamin D. There was a significant effect of 25[OH]D supplementation ( cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol ) on BMI change through a meta- analysis of published clinical trials."
16286432," OBJECTIVE To assess the development of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) from the year of diagnosis to 1985. The paper also describes the risk factors for work disability among patients with RA. A longitudinal, long-term prospect i ve study was conducted on a large cohort of RA patients who were gainfully employed at onset of RA. The patients were prospect ively followed for an average of 10 years and were treated according to the "" sawtooth "" strategy. Of these 698, the patient's age was obtained through a telephone survey of all patient visits. The cumulative duration of sick leaves and RA related disability pensions was counted.. RESULTS Of the patients who entered the second year of treatment, 35.7 % held a paid job.. The total direct costs for the 338 patients during one year ( third quarter 2000 to second quarter 2001 ) were € 3815 per patient-year. The prevalence of work disability at the end of the study was 37 %. The majority of patients that eventually got sick leave had stopped working the first year after onset. Among those who continued to work ( 44 patients ), those with high levels of discretion over the pace and activities of work.. Although the majority of workers with RA were in the labor market, they had the lowest average LPT/week, and the highest number of workers who were able to stay on the job. The 3 most important predictors for this work disability were the age group. The mean age of patients who experienced the disease was 58 years. The higher risk of workplace productivity... the incidence of RA and its related work disability is higher..

14583987," BACKGROUND To determine the effect of feeding different infant formulas on the incidence of asthma and the development of  asthma related outcomes in children at age 6 years. OBJECTIVE We sought to examine prospect ively whether supplementary feeding of CM at the maternity hospital would increase the risk when compared with feeding with pasteurized human milk or hydrolyzed formula. METHODS 216 high-risk infants whose mothers had elected not to breast-feed were r and omized to receive exclusively a partial whey hydrolysate formula or a conventional cow's milk formula. A blind follow up examination was done 18 months after the expected date of birth. RESULTS Of this cohort of infants, 14 % ( 95 % CI = 7. 7%-22.7 % ) were determined to have asthma. At 2 years of age, the majority of infants were found to be exclusively breast-fed. The infants were followed for 18 to 34 months of age. The median S-IgE value was significantly lower at 2 weeks of age in the whey hydrolysate ( p < 0.001 ). The parents were highly motivated and compliance was good. The rate of occurrence was similar between the three formula groups. The prevalence of asthma, third trimester antepartum haemorrhage, whooping cough, recurrent abdominal pain, and migraine.. In the subgroup of infants with a family history of atopy, however, those in trial A who received preterm formula rather than milk formulas had a significantly greater risk of developing one or more allergic reactions ( notably eczema ). In both CMPA groups there was a significant increase over basal values in trypsin, chymotrypsin, and lipase concentrations after 6 weeks. To determine whether use of hydrolysed formulas for infant feeding prevents allergy and food intolerance, to determine which infants benefit including infants at low or high risk of allergy or food intolerance.

26605535," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of a modified shoe that incorporates both lateral wedging and a variable-stiffness sole on knee joint loading in people with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. Biomechanical evaluation of orthoses shows that there are potentially beneficial biomechanical changes to joint loading ; however, evaluation in relation to clinical outcome measures in longitudinal studies is needed. RESULTS Ninety participants ( 30 per group ) underwent a 3-dimensional gait analysis  across 3 test conditions : modified shoes, st and ard control shoes, and barefoot. For each condition, the first peak knee adduction moment ( KAM ) and knee flexion moment ( KFM ) ( both expressed as Nm/[body weight × height]% ) as well as the KAM impulse and the patient-perceived global change scores. CONCLUSIONS The modified shoes significantly reduced the peak KAM as compared to the control shoes at one month, and change scores were compared between high and low users of insoles using general linear models. The performance of the checklist improved considerably after revision of a pilot version. The patients were r and omized to an insole or brace. The gait was analyzed with and without wearing the orthosis ( KR-20 : 0.54 ). Test-retest ( r 0.88 ) and inter-rater ( p=0.75 ) reliability of this measure was observed at 3 months, with 25 ( 69 % ) and 26 ( 72 % ) of 36 individuals reporting global improvement in pain and functioning, respectively. Regression analyses demonstrated that disease severity, baseline functioning, and magnitude of immediate change in knee joint load were predictive of clinical outcome after walking."
26746590," Previous research has shown that ecstasy ( 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) ) has been associated with cognitive impairments. However, it can not be excluded that observed differences between users and non-users are the cause rather than the consequence of ecstasy use. In humans, MDMA causes hyperthermia at warm ambient temperatures but hypothermia at cold ones. In this study we used an n-back task and fMRI to investigate the effects of MDMA on brain activation in humans with treatment-resistant PTSD. The two groups displayed similar past histories in relation to a range of illicit drugs, and were divided into low, medium and high users. The controls comprised 20 illicit recreational drug users who had never taken Ecstasy. At t1, all subjects had very limited amphetamine and /or ecstasy experience ( less than 5 units lifetime dose ). Based on the reported drug use at t2, subjects with continued ecstasy use ( 1.8±1.3 tablets ). Outcome measures used were the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) and the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale ( PDS ). There were no differences in cognitive impairment between the 2 groups. Subjective well-being, happiness, closeness to others, openness, and trust were increased by MDMA. Compared with placebo, we therefore focus on subjects with moderate use patterns, in order to assess the evidence for harmful effects. We did not see statistically significant reductions in CAPS scores ( p = 0.066 ), although there was clinical ly and statistically significant self-reported ( CIDI ). The current findings suggest that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can be administered to posttraumatic stress disorder patients without evidence of harm."
19821273," BACKGROUND We studied the effects of aspirin and aspirin in patients with transient ischaemic attack ( TIA ), and their combination with a calcium antagonist, was examined. The study subjects were 57 chronic CI patients ( 40 men, 17 women ; mean age, 68.5 years ) who experienced either stroke or thromboembolism. We compared clopidogrel with aspirin and omly assigned to either group A ( aspirin 300 mg daily ) with ( n = 9 ) or without ( n=1376 ) dipyridamole ( 200 mg twice daily ). The total number of patients screened was 4033 ; 1632 were enrolled, 821 r and omized to aspirin ( 75 mg day(-1 ) ) or clopidogrel. The primary outcome was total stroke ( p-selectin ) and the differences between treatment groups were not significant. The secondary endpoint was a composite of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infa rct ion, or death from any cause. This study was registered as an International St and ard R and omised Controlled Trial (. ) and with Clinical Trials.gov ( NCT00109382 ). RESULTS Aspirin is the most widely studied and prescribed antiplatelet agent for preventing serious vascular events, reducing the odds of such events among high vascular risk patients by about a quarter.. The use of ASA result ed in greater inhibition compared with clopidogrel with epinephrine ( p < 0.0001 ) and placebo. The combined end point of cardiovascular death ( ticlopidine and clopidogrel ) versus aspirin was present in 19 patients on clopidogrel ( 3.7 % vs. 2.5 % ; P=0.001 ), whereas a delayed reduction was seen in group B ( 72.0+/-3.0 % versus 52.6+/-4.2 % ). CONCLUSIONS The combination of ASA and clopidogrel appears superior to monotherapy with either aspirin or clopidogrel in preventing serious adverse events, including stroke, the combined use of the two agents. The dual-therapy group was significantly more effective than aspirin alone in preventing vascular events ( stroke, coronary artery..A.  Thienopyridine derivatives inhibit platelet activation by a different mechanism and so may be more effective."
24088547," BACKGROUND The effects of severe iodine deficiency during pregnancy can cause transient maternal hypothyroidism and impaired mental development. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of iodine supplementation on maternal thyroid function in pregnant women and their newborns. A total of 131 pregnant women were recruited and r and omized in two groups and treated daily for up to six months after delivery with 200 microg iodide ( group A ) or 50 microg iodine ( group B ).. In both groups the mothers were r or omized to be controls or to receive 200 micrograms iodine/day from weeks 17 - 18 of pregnancy.  Biochemical, anthropometric, and dietary data were collected from each child at baseline and after 28 wk.. The median urinary iodine concentration ( UIC ) was 113 μg/l, which falls between 100 and 199 μg/liter... There was no significant difference between TSH levels in women with positive or negative TPO antibodies. The thyrotropin ( TSH ) levels and kidneys of mothers were also assessed in the postpartum period, whereas the median serum thyroxine concentration was 115 nmol/l. The outcomes suggest that a relatively low iodine intake during pregnancy is not associated with increased iodine status, with a mean increase of 1.6 + /- 0.6 ml ( 16.2 %, P= 0.05 ). The findings from the current study indicate that the majority of these women had normal TSH, the prevalence of which was almost 6-fold higher in women who had received iodine..  The thythyroid volume increased, on the average, by 30 %, and the frequency of hypothyroxinemia was < 1 %. CONCLUSIONS We undertook a systematic review of  the impact of iodo supplementation in population s with mild-to-moderate iodine depletion. The benefits of i iodine administration in population.A). and."
19843330," BACKGROUND Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors improve the outcome among patients with stroke. This often manifests as comparatively high thresholds for starting treatment and modest targets in reducing blood pressure. Patients were r and omized to c and esartan, transient ischemic attacks ( TIA ) and diastolic blood pressure reductions were significantly more pronounced with amlodipine. The study was also design ed to provide an estimate of the number of cases required to perform a larger phase III efficacy study. RESULTS : Blood pressure reduction was only about 3/2 mmHg greater in the amlodipine-based regimen, whereas cardiac failure was non-significantly lower on valsartan... The primary end point was the composite of total mortality and all cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, and there was a non‐significant 11 % reduction in mortality. The secondary outcome was a composite of myocardial infa rct ion, stroke, or death from cardiorenal causes. The trial was a two-by-two factorial study evaluating both ramipril and placebo. The mean follow‐up was 2.6 years. Results : Patients on atenolol had a risk of 97/732 ( 13.3 % ) for the combined outcome event versus a risk estimate of 95/741 ( 12.8 % ). The relative risk by proportional hazards regression analysis was 0.71 ( P = 0.0009 ). For deaths from all causes, the adjusted hazard ratio for stroke ( 1.1 ), was lower than in previous uncorrected analyses. ( This regression dilution bias is quite general, so analogous corrections to the relations of cholesterol to CHD or of various other risk factors to stroke or to other diseases would likewise increase their estimated strengths. CONCLUSIONS While hypertension is a leading risk factor for an initial stroke. The role of blood pressure lowering to prevent subsequent stroke is less clear. The results of recent large clinical trials investigating effects of antihypertensive agents in patients with a history of stroke have not shown a significant benefit. The available trials to examine the role of antihyppertensive drugs in preventing recurrent stroke."
31611064," We investigated the effects of zinc supplementation on the response to interferon ( IFN ) and ribavirin therapy  in patients with chronic hepatitis C. In the group which received zinc acetate 600 mg a day for 7 days, serum zinc had been restored to normal by day 8. The aim of the present pilot study is to determine the effect of 30 mg elemental zinc on biochemical and virological response in a population of patients with liver cirrhosis and zinc deficiency. The control group ( n = 30 ) received placebo ( starch ).. The patients who continued treatment, the serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) level at the end of treatment and the follow-up period was compared to the control group. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response ( SVR ). The serum zinc levels were significantly lower in the zinc group than in healthy controls and further depressed by IFN/ribavirin. The mean differences of quantitative variables between and within groups were evaluated by independent sample s t-test and paired- sample s... Sustained eradication for the hepatitis C virus RNA.. the patients who never showed clinical signs of hepatic encephalopathy during the trial were 16 ( 53.30 % ) patients from the interventional group and in 8 of 10 control patients at 48 wk.

23913029," OBJECTIVE To examine the link between childhood obesity and cognitive functioning.. The study examined the effects of a multidisciplinary behavioral intervention including cognitive behavioral therapy, structured physical activity, and dietary counseling on short- and long-term weight loss and maintenance in children.. Method : Forty-two children in their preschool year ( mean age 4.2 years, body mass index [ BMI ] = 26 ± 4.6 kg/m², BMI z-score = 2.1 ± 0.4 ) were r and omized to either the 6 week EF-training condition or to a  control condition.. RESULTS There was a significant difference, F(1, 58)=7.44, p <.009, between males and females for relative VO2max, and scores on balance subtest in the obese. This study found that the obesity and its related behaviors were significantly associated with the hyperactivity/inattention subscale ( HI ) of the parent-rated Strengths and Difficulty Question naire ( SDQ ).. Using multiple logistic regression, children who failed the ATDG task were more likely to be overweight at 11 years ( relative risk, 1.29 ; 95 % confidence interval.. ), independent of income to needs ratio. The cognitive and achievement results suggest that obesity may be associated with poorer motor skills, but this relationship was mostly absent in children and adolescents.. Although obesity has been linked to poorer neurocognitive functioning in adults, the relationship between obesity and obesity-related behaviors with neurocognitive functioning has been less well studied. Although Obesity and obesity related behaviors are common in children, much less is known about this problem in children than in adults.. Further underst and ing of these relationships in children, particularly children with obesity and hyperactivity/impulsivity, throughout the world, may help us to understand the problem of obesity and related behaviors with cognitive functioning in youth..)."
22405279," Background and Purpose — Few reliable estimates of the long-term effectiveness after stroke of interventions for behaviour modification and ensuring concordance with therapies. This population -based study aim ed to describe disability, dependency, and related independent prognostic factors at 5 years after a first-ever stroke. Methods : We sent a question naire to r and omly selected residents in Berlin who were ≥50 years of age enquiring about knowledge of stroke risk factors.  Knowledge was assessed in an open-ended question. In addition, we enquired about the source of participants'information. Sociodemographic factors, including age, sex, educational level, and nationality.  PROTECT interventions were initiated before hospital discharge in all PROTECT – target ( underlying stroke mechanism large vessel atherosclerosis or small vessel disease ) and PROTECT - ACS ( At-risk for Coronary Sequelae ) patients. Results : Although there were no significant differences between the two groups at entry to study, at 3 and 6 mos after stroke, the intervention group showed better scores than the control group in functional status ( FIM ™ instrument ) and number of walks taken ( p<0.001 ). Of the 205 patients enrolled in the initial study, 102 patients attended for repeat interview ( 49 intervention/53 control ). A total of 626 ( 76.2 % ) respondents correctly listed ≥1 established stroke risk factor, but only 409 ( 49.8 % ) Respondents were observed in perceived health status, satisfaction with care or depression scores. Conclusion A feature of stroke and recurrent stroke include smoking, alcohol consumption, poor diet, and physical inactivity. We believe that these criteria provide the best compromise between practicability and acceptability of stroke prevention programs.A review.. The present study suggests that a low level of activity before the stroke is that it recurs ( 25 % within five-years ). and/)..."
24700446," We prospect ively examined the clinical and radiographic outcomes of the first 230 primary total hip replacement ( THR ) for osteoarthritis ( OA ). We compared 50 consecutive metal-metal resurfacing replacements in 50 patients with an uncemented porous-coated acetabular component. The average age was 57 years, and two patients ( mean age 62 ) were operated on with cemented THR. Of 200 patients, 14 ( 7.0 % ) required revision surgery at a mean time of 19.5 months ( range, 3 - 47 months ). Patients and reference group answered SF-36 and WOMAC question naires. The mean Harris hip score improved significantly ( paired t-test, p < 0.05 ) from 62.54 ( 8 to 92 ) pre-operatively to 97.7 ( 61 to 100 ). There was no difference in the postoperative Harris hip scores ( 46 vs 52 points ), but the patients with the hybrid THR attained better scores. At follow up, the only difference between the two groups was the rate of neck narrowing, with an average pain score of 15 points and an average function score of 26 points. The revision rate was similar. The relatively high polyethylene wear rate is attributed in part to the younger patient population and the use of 32-mm femoral heads paired with thin polyethylene liners. The adjusted incidence rate ratio for dislocation ( obese versus nonobese ) was 2.4 ( 95 % CI 1.4, 4.2 ). The overall incidence of revision, adverse events, and postoperative component malalignment compare among studies of metal-on-metal hip resurfacing with THA  among patients with hip osteoarthritis. Secondarily, we compared the revision frequency identified in this systematic review with revisions reported in four major joint replacement registries."
25899581," OBJECTIVE To determine the natural course of insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes, we followed 15 patients prospect ively for one year after the diagnosis of diabetes, whereas they also performed a cross-sectional study of 53 additional patients who had had diabetes for 2 to 32 years. RESULTS To compare the effects of a 3 months'antihypertensive treatment with carvedilol, a non-selective β-adrenoceptor blocker with α1-blocking properties, with the β1-specific receptor blocker metoprolol on insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic hypertensive patients. OBJECTIVE Retinopathy incidence was 56 % ( 429/764, 95 % CI 52 - 59 % ). Key risk factors included diabetes duration and glycemic control. We found no evidence of a threshold effect for HbA1c on insulin resistance.. Univariate associations were observed between incidence and albumin excretion rate, cholesterol, triglyceride, fibrinogen, von Willebr and factor, fasting insulin, waist-to-hip ratio, and insulin dose. In patients with diabetes, insulin sensitivity was also reduced by an average of 40 percent ( although there was considerable variation between patients ), and it was inversely related to glycemic control and relative body weight. Thus, in patients with newly diagnosed Type I diabetes, a transient normalization of insulin sensitivity may occur after an initial reduction, along with a partial recovery of endogenous insulin secretion, and diabetes status. Conclusion This study confirms previous findings of a reduction in insulin sensitivity after chronic metoprolol treatment, however, result ed in a slight increase in insulin resistance and a better lipid profile. We thus demonstrate that a β-blocker with low plasma insulin sensitivity ( R = 0.706.). Insulin-stimulated fATP correlated positively with whole-body insulin sensitivity, though not with total and abdominal adiposity. and the metabolic syndrome."

In addition to bringing physical and mental health benefits, the association between physical activity and affect in the daily lives of children with ADHD.. In this within subjects design, each participant experienced each of three treatments ( environments ) in single blind controlled trials. Seventeen children aged 7 to12 years old professionally diagnosed with ADHD were r and omly assigned to one of two groups in a 1/1 ratio, which requires a 5-min run without a rest interval. The proposed physical stimulus was performed with 28 volunteers : 14 with ADHD ( GE-EF ) and 14 without ADHD symptoms ( GC-EF. After each walk, concentration was measured using Digit Span Backwards. Results : Children with ADHD  concentrated better after the exercise compared with the control group, and the three groups were compared to evaluate the effect of the drug on cognition. The results showed that all physical fitness components studied were significantly related to both inhibition and switching, but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups. The findings suggest that the benefits of physical exercise can improve the performance of those with ADHD, especially the executive function. The authors found that acute physical activity utilizing exergaming has the potential to improve specific aspects of executive functions ( ADHD ). The objective of this research being reported here was to carry out a systematic review of articles relating that exercise sessions have on children and adolescents with this pathology."

Method and omized controlled trial with blinded evaluation. A total of 70 participants ( 14 women ), aged 44.5 + /- 6.1 years, and 6 men ( age 40+/-11 years ) completed baseline and intervention measures for step counts, % body fat, waist circumference and systolic/diastolic blood pressure. The study was multi-disciplinary and based in the community. RESULTS : Participants exercised alternately on a treadmill and recumbent cycle ergometer for a 6-month training period.. The intervention group received the same walking program.. the control group received no intervention... Secondary outcome measures were changes in self-reported leisure time in any sports/recreation in  the last 3 months, and all- purpose walking ( APW ) for exercise, tissue plasminogen activator and microalbuminuria. Results Significant differences between groups were recorded for physical activity after 6 and 12 weeks ( p<0.01 ). The experimental group had increased levels of physical activity from baseline to 6 months ( p < 0.001 ) and increased the average time spent walking per week by 72 minutes ( + 1 to + 137 minutes ). There were no significant changes. The control group, free-living step counts remained < 5400 steps.d(-1 ) and did not significantly differ from baseline for each group. CONCLUSIONS Findings have implication s for work-based physical activity promotion and the development of walking interventions, with or without support material s, to improve health outcomes in a Scottish community sample not meeting current physical activity recommendations.. Conclusion Using a r and omize controlled trials design, this study assessed the impact of a 12-week graduated pedometer to promote walking.. Although this intervention on daily step-counts, they were of a relatively short duration, with small clinical based sample s. Further research is required to demonstrate their effectiveness in adequately powered, community based studies."
27994451," Background : To evaluate the effects of an exercise adherence intervention for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ). While practice guidelines recommend regular physical activity ( PA ), these are often not sufficient to change the amount of daily physical activity a patient undertakes. Behaviour-change self-management programmes are design ed to address this, including setting motivational goals and providing social support. We performed a r and omized, three-period, cross-over study ( 21 days of treatment separated by two wash-out periods of 13 days ) with patients with COPD. The intervention group was offered an additional eight-session activity counselling program. The primary outcomes were daily walking time and time spent in at least moderate intense activities. Results : The Chronic Respiratory Question naire total score improved 15.1 points with exercise training compared with 8.7 points with rehabilitation alone. The difference of 7.5 points was not significant ( p = 0.08 ). The telehealth program with decision support showed good satisfaction ( mean 26.4 ± 14 min vs 12[2–26 ] min ). Conclusion The sample had a mean age of 68 ±11 and forced expiratory volume in one second 18 % predicted. Participants reported that logging their exercise and symptoms ( FEV1 ) of 40 ± was easy and that keeping track of their physical activity. There were no differences in daily activity at 20 weeks or any differences in any primary variable at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS The intervention enhanced exercise capacity in COPD, and as a result, interventions to improve physical activity, including the use of PA, are a current research focus. However, many trials have been small and inconclusive. OBJECTIVE The aim of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to study the effect of r and Omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) targeting PA in COPDs.. and).-"

Of the 58 patients, 44 ( 76 % ) had never been successfully treated with antidepressant medication. During a 12-week open-label treatment period, citalopram could be titrated up to a maximum dose of 60 mg/ day.. The primary outcome of remission of symptoms was defined as a score of 7 or less on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( HAM-D ). For patients with insufficient response to SSRIs, switching is often applied. This article aims to systematic ally review the evidence for switching pharmacotherapy after the initial SSRI. The overall response rate was 46 % ( 26/57 ). The total scores were highly correlated with IDS-SR(30 ), and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. The majority of patients who did not recover continued in an episode that looked more like dysthymia. The incidence of adverse effects was comparable between treatment groups..A"
16539827," This study aimed to assess the validity of the  Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ), Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale ( CES-D ), and the General Well-Being Schedule depression subscale ( GWB-D ), were studied in rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ). The question naires ( Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales [ AIMS ], Functional Status Index [ FSI ],  Health  Assessment  Question naire [ HAQ ], Index of  Well  Being [ IWB ], and Sickness Impact Profile  [ SIP ] ) were administered to 38 patients with ankylosing spondylitis. The study showed that the index was sufficiently sensitive to detect a statistically significant difference between the responses of patients with RA to an anti-inflammatory agent and to a simple analgesic. The instrument showed substantial improvements in Physical Function, Psychological Status, and Pain, as well as in overall Arthritis Impact. The validity of instruments measuring impairments in body structures and function were assessed. The objective is : 1 ) to make an inventory of constructs, based on the domains of  the International Classification of Functioning, Disabilities and Health problems ( ICF ), to analyse whether validation against the same construct result ed in higher correlation coefficients than validation against a dissimilar construct."
30019391," OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to investigate the durability of extensive dentin-enamel-bonded posterior ceramic coverages  in a 15 years follow-up. This study compared the clinical outcomes of metal-based fixed partial dentures luted conventionally with zinc phosphate and self-adhesive resin cement. The authors accessed the data base of an industry-scale machining center in Germany and obtained information on 34,911 computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing ( CAM ) all-ceramic posterior restorations. The restorations were heat pressed following the lost-wax method. In 106 restorations the classic Syntac was used in combination with the dual-cured resin composite Variolink. The other restorations were luted with  the chemically cured resin composite Bisfil 2B and bonded with 3-step etch and rinse systems, classic Gluma ( 37 ), Allbond 2 ( 57 ), Syntac ( 32 ), One step ( 20 ). The clinical reevaluations were performed at baseline and 13, 25, and 36 months after insertion of the PCRs. Two restorations ( 1 indirect composite inlay and 1 margin of a direct composite restoration )  failed during the second year because of fracture. A total of 47,474 crown restoration occasions were obtained from the literature. The overall survival rate of IP-PCRs was 100 %, and all-porcelain crowns the shortest-48 % at 10 years. Factors which were found to influence outcome of crowns included type of crown, age of patient, patient payment exemption status, patient attendance pattern and on vital teeth in 20.9 % ( p=0.014 ). Logistic regression indicated that single-tooth InCeram ® Zirconia and CAD/CAM-generated restorations are an alternative to conventional restorations if large coronal defects need to be treated surgically."
21827522," BACKGROUND The authors conducted a r and omized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a brief cognitive‐behavioral therapy ( CBT ) for patients with temporom and ibular disorders ( TMD ) who demonstrated poor psychosocial adaptation to their TMD condition. The authors classified 96 patients with acute TMD ( less than six months'duration ) as HR or an education/attention control condition ( n = 79 ). Participants completed outcome ( pain, activity interference, jaw function, and depression ) and process ( pain beliefs, catastrophizing, and coping ) measures before and at a one-year follow-up. Results demonstrated that, in terms of a self‐reported pain score, all three treatment groups had significantly decreased pain scores from pretreatment to posttreatment, while the no-treatment group did not. The combined biofeedback and CBST treatment produced the most comprehensive improvements across all outcome measures. In individual mediator analyses, change in perceived pain control was the mediator that explained the greatest proportion of the total treatment effect on each outcome. Analyzing the mediators as a group, self‐efficacy had unique mediating effects beyond those of control and the other mediators. We are trying to combine results of these studies and to explore the effectiveness."
23269815," BACKGROUND Low homocysteine and low B vitamin concentrations have been linked to the risk of vascular disease. Although numerous studies have assessed the impact of vitamin B-12 supplementation on cognitive function, the effect of dietary patterns on homocysteine concentrations. The objective was to investigate whether supplementation of the three vitamins can lower tHcy, and dietary intakes. We conducted a two-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, r and omized clinical trial involving 276 healthy participants, 65 years of age or older, with plasma homocysteine concentrations of at least 13 micromol per liter.. : We identified 712 breast cancer case patients and selected 712 individually matched control subjects.  Dietary information was obtained using food frequency question naires given in 1980, 1984, 1986, and 1990... The mean change in homocysteine was measured as alpha erythrocyte aspartate aminotransferase activation coefficient ( αEAST ) ; vitamin B12 and folate concentrations were measured in plasma. RESULTS : Baseline homocysteine concentrations were significantly less likely than non-supplement-users to have concentrations < 185 pmol/L (. ), and the activity coefficient of erythrocyte alpha-aspartic acid ( P < 0.001 ). The use of these data to estimate dose-response relations provides a useful means to summarize the body of evidence. CONCLUSIONS The results of this trial were significantly and inversely associated with baseline homocysteine concentration ( -0.3 microg/L ; 95 % CI, 0.01 to 0.55 ; P for trend=0.79 ).. Multivitamin/mineral supplementation can improve B-vitamin status and reduce homocysteine concentrations by 13 % and biomarkers. The study showed that the study population was small and observational studies have provided information on the association between vitamin B‑12 intake and biomarkers..

26914664," Background : To examine the predictive validity of the time spent in specific intensities of activity and inactivity,  cardiorespiratory fitness and body composition in children. Methods : A cross-sectional study was conducted in a r and om sample of children. Students were monitored with  calorie expenditure, measured by indirect calorimetry, as a criterion reference st and ard. The treatment group experienced significant increases in calorie expenditure over the control group, the physical activity intervention involved walking for 30 min and then sitting. The secondary aims are to determine the independent and combined effects of PA and SB on  children  from age 7 to 9 years ( data collected 2006/2007 and 2008/2009 ; analyzed in 2010 ) and determine whether the intervention is cost-effective. Methods / design A four-arm cluster-r and omized controlled trial ( RCT ) with a 2 × 2 factorial design, with children as the unit of analysis.. Physical activity intensity was estimated using five independently developed cut points : Freedson/Trost ( FT ), Puyau ( PU ), Treuth ( TR ), Mattocks ( MT ), and Evenson ( EV ). Classification accuracy was evaluated via weighted κ statistics and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( ROC-AUC ). In the cohort of girls measured in both 6th and 8th grade s, this association was significantly associated with follow up FMI ( β = 0.004, 95 % CI 0.0009–0.006 ). The activPAL count function was positively correlated with waist circumference in boys ( r =.33, p<0.001 ), but the association between MVPA and WC did not reach significance. The results of this study strongly support promotion of MVPA."
28752947," BACKGROUND Although basic research has uncovered biological mechanisms by which exercise could maintain and enhance adult brain health, experimental human studies with older adults have produced equivocal results. The finding supports the idea that it is possible to maintain good physical functioning by multi-component exercise program and thus postpone the age-related functional problems. Design : This 1-year r and omized, controlled exercise intervention trial assessed the effects of two different training programs and their combination on physical functioning and bone in older adults. RESULTS : Fifty-seven older adults ( 62–85 years ) participated in aerobic or strength- and -flexibility exercise training for 10 months. Neurocognitive tasks were selected to reflect a range from little ( e.g., simple reaction time ) to substantial ( i.e., Stroop Word – Color conflict ) executive control. Results : Performance in the aerobic ( -12 %, P=.047 ), therapist contact, and two instrumental ADLs. The FLEX group participated in a group exercise class that incorporated flexibility and balance activities. The mean inter-group difference was 10 % ( 95 % CI : 0–22 % ). The gait time to exhaustion was measured by the FLEX training group showed no change ( p = 0.47 ).. The 1-RM significantly increased ( P < or =.05 ) for all exercises tested for both the HEX and LEX groups... Functional training is a new training vision that was prepared from the gesture imitation of daily activities. Although your use has become popular in clinical practice, the influence of the several cardiorespiratory adjustments performed during the functional training in different population s and conditions is unknown. Conclusion : The use of this systematic review was limited to the study group. The study showed that the majority of training was performed in a clinical practice. The total PEDro score was not the same as the one used for the control group.).."
9755013," A prospect i ve, controlled clinical trial was carried out to assess the effect of physiotherapy and electroacupuncture in the treatment of neck pain. The results suggested that, while both methods were effective, electroacupuncture produced an earlier symptomatic improvement with increased neck movement, especially in patients with mild degenerative changes of the cervical spine. The outcome was the proportion of patients with neck pain, the mean visual analog scales for pain and activity showed no significant differences between manipulation and control groups. In the analysis, a significant increase in measured rotation that was maintained for three weeks than that of a placebo. The second group ( B ) was treated with the same inpatient MMCBT, that is, without any significant change in pain. The results showed that the majority of cases, no specific cause can be identified. In order to gain insight into the clinical course and prognostic factors of non-specific neck pain ; a systematic review was conducted."
19457497," Background and Purpose — The baroreceptor reflex arc is important in the recovery of activities of daily living and motor functions after stroke. In animals, dextroamphetamine ( AMPH ) paired with training enhances motor recovery. A small number of clinical studies have investigated the effects of the noradrenergic agonist amphetamine in patients with acute cerebral ischemia. Methods — One hundred twenty-four patients underwent simultaneous ECG and noninvasive beat-to-beat blood pressure ( BP ) monitoring within 72 hours of onset of symptoms. Subjects received dexamphetamine ( 5 mg initially, then 10 mg for 10 subsequent doses with 3- or 4-day separations ) or placebo in addition to inpatient physiotherapy. Secondary measures : motor scales ( Fugl – Meyer ( FM ) ), and functional scales ( Barthel index ( BI ) and modified Rankin score ( mRS ) ). Survival and dependency were assessed at 6 months. Outcomes were adjusted for age, sex, clinical stroke syndrome, time to r and omization, consciousness level, and follow-up 1 year later.. Results — Baseline hemiparesis was severe overall ( mean FM score 27.7±20.0 ). Motor scores improved during treatment in both groups ( mean change, baseline to 3 months 29.5±16.6 ). Repeated- measures ANOVA revealed no significant differences in recovery between the treatment groups for the entire cohort ( n=67 ) or for subgroups with a severe hemiparesis ( N=43 ), moderate hemiparesis ( n =24 ), or cortically based stroke. The use of drugs to enhance recovery ( "" rehabilitation pharmacology "" ) has been assessed. Amphetamine can improve outcome in experimental models of stroke, and several small clinical trials have assessed its use in stroke."
22786497," BACKGROUND Previous studies indicate that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) have been reported to be useful in the treatment of  depression. The authors performed a double-blind study of citalopram versus placebo in patients with recurrent unipolar, recurrent depression.. The efficacy of citalopram, a noncompetitive glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA)-receptor blocker, was compared with that of escitalopram, a compound that acts on different transporter system and may reduce craving, and the placebo. RESULTS : Patients with recurrent depression were r and omly assigned to receive citalopram ( 20 mg/day ), escitalopram, or a placebo. The primary efficacy measure was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ), there were no significant differences between the 2 groups. The secondary outcome measures were the proportion of patients who completed the study. The two drug groups were comparable in terms of sex, age, and depression severity. The antidepressant efficacy was assessed by the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( Hamilton-D, and Clinical Global Impression Scale for Severity. The evaluation of efficacy was performed with use of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale total score at all study visits. The superiority of citalopram compared with placebo was observed in both groups, with the majority of patients on citalopram ( n=37 ) than the other drugs. The clinical practice guidelines recommend that citalopram, as the sole antidepressant, should be considered amongst the antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care. The percentage of complete response after 5 weeks was higher than placebo, the second-generation antidepressants, especially citalopram, but the efficacy of escitalopram was lower than other antidepressants. Citalopram, one of these antidepressant drugs, and tricyclics, and other non-conventional antidepressants in treating depression./A-R+.) } --)."
27306431," Background To investigate the relationship between physical activity ( PA ) and health indicators among school-age children and adolescents. This study was a prospect i ve cohort study using data from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Growth and Health Study. The study was therefore to assess the 3 yr-follow-up of a cluster-r and omized controlled school-based physical activity program over nine month to identify best levels of evidence. RESULTS : A total of 102 schoolchildren ( age 10 - 14 years ) in Switzerl and were assessed using the self-report Mood and Feelings Question naire ( MFQ ).. Physical activity was assessed with 5 d of accelerometry and expressed in min/d of moderate or vigorous PA.  CVF was measured with a multistage treadmill test and was expressed as the oxygen consumption at a heart rate of 170 bpm.. The odds of being overweight and obese by age 14 ( outcome ) were estimated using logistic regression for complex sample s.. Those who exceeded the 300-minutes PA threshold at all 3 visits had a 2.6 mmHg lower mean increase in DBP from 11 to 14 years compared with those classified below the threshold in all visits... Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity to the same extent as PA.. Mixed-model regression indicated no relationship between PA, total PA, and the percentage of time spent in MVPA.. Although not statistically significant, lower levels of physical activity were associated with lower BMI, and higher levels of body composition, this might be through PA or trough an effect of PA on muscle mass. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the relationships between objective ly measured PA ( total and all intensities ), the health indicators in school-aged children and youth.. Emerging evidence suggests other intensities of PA, including light-intensity activity ( LPA ), may also be important, but there has been no rigorous evaluation of the evidence."

This study examined the relationship between the incidence of low back  and the association between these factors in young adults. The study was conducted in a cohort of young adults in their transition from school to working life. RESULTS A prospective cohort study was carried out among 669 healthy male conscripts. In Finl and, military service is compulsory for male citizens and 90 % of young men enter into the service. A total of 144 nurses from six Hong Kong district hospitals completed a face-to-face baseline interview, which was followed-up by a telephone interview. The main study measures were demographic characteristics, work activities, work stress, physical leisure activities and  the nature of back pain. In the active treatment groups, patients improved regarding perceived disability, main complaints, and current pain at follow-up. Odds ratios ( OR ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) were calculated. Results. The cumulative incidence of LBP was 16 %.. The overall incidence was 21.3 % ( 95 % CI 1.22–1.99, P ≤ 0.01 ).

28371813," BACKGROUND : To assess the effectiveness of a home based exercise programme to reduce falls and injuries in older adults. A municipality in the north of England. The main outcome measure was the cost-effectiveness of a multidisciplinary fall prevention program compared with usual Dutch healthcare in older people. The intervention group was compared with controls. The number of active life-years was examined at baseline and at follow-up visits for weeks 9 to 24. The study was performed from a societal perspective. The control group received the usual care. The outcome measures were the total cost of a once-weekly or twice-weekly exercise programme ( control group ). The analysis was carried out with three different time perspectives. Main outcome measures : Number of falls, number of injuries result ing from falls, costs of implementing the programme, and hospital costs as a result of falls. Results : Falls were reduced by 46 % ( incidence rate ratio 0.54, 95 % confidence interval 0.32 to 0.90 ). For Otago delivered to persons aged 80 years and older, the net benefit was $ 429.18 and the ROI was 127 %. The cost of the intervention program for older people was $ NZ1803 ( £ 523 ) to the control group. The results are preliminary and a longer study is required to confirm the results. The economic evaluation of this programme was 0.41 ( 95%CI=0.18, 0.65 ) per fall prevented. The costs of health interventions in this setting were less than home modifications, but home modifications cost only $ 14,794 ( 95 % CI = € 8300 to € 87 120 ).Conclusion : Healthy ageing and health promotion ( HP ) programmes for older adults are a cost-effective approach to prevent falls in primary care. andA/-R+) .},)."

The measurement of athletic movement skill may afford practitioners insight into the greatest days absent from training and match play. Study Design Descriptive epidemiology study. The players ( 44 ± 7 years ; 178 ± 7 cm, 84 ± 11 kg ) were evaluated. The ACL injury incidence was monitored monthly throughout the season. The student t test and Fisher's exact test were compared to the injured and noninjured subjects, and the following:. The FMS, which consisted of 7 movement tests ( each score range : 0–3, total score range, and a 10-yd shuttle run ). The incidence of running injuries ( time lost because of injury ⩽ 4 weeks ) was investigated through a follow-up survey during the 6-month season. RESULTS The FMS score was not different between those injured ( n = 74 ) and those not ( 14.1 ± 2.4 ; P =.57 ). A significant effect of developmental level was evident on 9 of the assessment s ( d = 0.27–0.88 ; p ⩽ 0.05 ).

We conducted a 12-week double-blind trial of citalopram, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in treating co-occurring symptoms of PTSD. Patients were r and omized 2:1 to either placebo. The initial dosage was 5 mg/day and then titrated every 1 to 2 weeks over 8 weeks to a maximum of 20 mg treatment. RESULTS Fifteen subjects entered treatment, fourteen of whom returned for subsequent visits. Of 10 patients who received lamotrigine, 5 ( 50 % ) responded according to the CAPS-2 total score and the proportion of responders on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale ( CGI-I ). The primary outcome measures were the 17-item total severity score of the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale-Severity ( CAPS-S ) and -Improvement.. The results suggest that PTSD is characterized by specific psychobiological dysfunctions, the CGI-2, and in the case of PTSD, that the placebo group had significantly greater decreases in PTSD -related symptoms than both other groups. Considering side effects, subjects on sertraline reported more gastrointestinal problems, with early terminators having more insomnia.. Conclusion"
21529374," BACKGROUND Dietary patterns that promote mild metabolic acidosis are recommended for optimum health in children. The objective was to test the effect of dietary protein on the parathyroid hormone ( PTH ), and the rate of bone loss.. We explored the association between dietary protein intake and urinary calcium excretion in healthy women.. The study consisted of a 2-wk adjustment period followed by a 4-d experimental period in which 20 healthy women consumed, in r and om order, the following 4 diets... Supplementation of the diet with CaCl and to a lesser extent with milk.. Net acid excretion was assessed by using the European Prospect i ve Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Norfolk ( EPIC-Norfolk ) food-frequency question naire. RESULTS A more acidic dietary intake ( high PRAL ) was significantly associated with lower serum PTH, a decrease of 0.6±0.6 ng/ml in serum osteocalcin, and a decrease in urinary calcium. In boys only, femoral neck SA- BMC was also significantly and positively associated with the intakes of both fruit and dietary vitamin C. There was no significant effect of protein intake on hip BMD. In the study, alkaline diets and products are marketed to avoid or counteract this acid, but the body regulate its pH to prevent and cure disease. CONCLUSIONS Higher dietary protein intakes may have positive effects on bone mineral status in both younger and older age groups, especially at the spine and femoral neck. The rate of pyrdinium cross-link excretion did not vary with protein intake but was approximately 33 % lower ( P < 0.01 ) during periods of high compared with low calcium intake. The additive effect of a high dietary acid load on bone-related parameters was not significant..). and--."

We compared the efficacy of a technology-based heart failure monitoring system, in particular whether they used a fixed effect model, which assumes that all the included patients are estimating the same true effect. METHODS This was a r and omized trial. Patients hospitalized with New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure, with a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 35 % were assigned to either control group or intervention group. The intervention group received a predischarge visit, two home visits, and then regular telephone calls over 9 months. The primary outcome was hospital readmission, and secondary outcomes were mortality. The control group received usual care. The study was conducted at six academic health systems in California. The group had fewer readmissions for any reason ( 86 v 114, P=0.018 ).

METHODS This double-blind, placebo-controlled study was discontinued early when adult bipolar patients in this single-center, randomized controlled trial, with bipolar disorder, who had been treated with adjunctive thrombiramate versus lithium carbonate and placebo. Efficacy end points included the Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ), Children's Depression Rating Scale, and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement. RESULTS Fifty-six children and adolescents ( 6 - 17 years ) with a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder were enrolled and titrated from 25 to 400 mg/day. The core study duration in all trials was 3 weeks. The study was conducted from October 2001 through October 2003. The primary outcome measure was the change in YMRS score from baseline to last study visit. Results : The mean score was not significantly different for the placebo group ( P<0.003 ) and from 20.9(2.9 ) to 9.6(3.5 ). Mean YMRS reductions in lithium-treated groups were significantly greater ( p < or = 0.001 ). The mean modal dosage of this study was 180 mg daily. There was a mean 1.8 kg decrease in patient weight  from the start of the study to week 16 ( P < 0.05 ). No serious adverse effects were observed.

The study examined the effect of electronic self-monitoring using smartphones on depressive and manic symptoms. The findings suggested that patients using the MONARCA system had more sustained depressive symptoms than patients using a smartphone for normal communicative purpose, but had fewer manic symptoms during the trial. METHOD A total of 78 patients with bipolar disorder according to ICD-10 criteria, aged 18 - 60 years, and with 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D(24 ) ). The effect of the application was tested in a parallel-group ( RCT ), a qualitative study ( second phase ) and a r and omized controlled trial ( third phase ). We will explore potential mechanisms of change, the impact of mood, mood symptoms, social support, and illness beliefs. RESULTS Participants in both groups showed baseline to endpoint reductions in mood symptoms and improvements in functionality, quality of life and medication adherence. The MoodSwings-Plus group showed a greater number of within-group changes on symptoms and functioning in depression and mania.. The outcomes were found to be highly correlated ( Pearson coefficient r = −.718 ; p <.001 ), whilst the correlation of ratings for mania with mood scores compared to LC-self. The data from interviews with a sub sample of 39 participants who did not complete the online program  were analyzed using “ thematic analysis ” to identify patterns in bipolar disorder. The results of this trial will inform the monitoring of mood and the outcome of bipolar disorder, to evaluate the role of electronic therapy on clinical outcomes. The paper-based mood charting tools are used in the diagnosis of mood disorders and to explore the effects of -.).. The authors' study."
26219990," BACKGROUND Patients with cystic fibrosis ( CF ) have many risk factors for reduced bone mineral density ( BMD ).. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a 6-month conditioning programme on peak oxygen uptake ( primary outcome ) and other markers of fitness, physical activity, anthropometry, lung function and quality of life. We studied 31 patients, 21 exercise and ten control, aged 10 to 30 years, with pulmonary involvement ranging from mild to severe. The exercise and control groups were not significantly different with respect to age, sex, pulmonary function, exercise tolerance, or cardiorespiratory fitness. After three months of physical conditioning, the exercise group had significantly increased exercise capacity and peak oxygen consumption and significantly lower heart rates for submaximal work loads. Patients were seen at baseline and after 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. The FEV1 decreased significantly in the control group. The relationship between all these variables and BMD measurements was analysed. There were no significant differences between the three groups in terms of disease severity, and length of stay in hospital. CONCLUSIONS The Shwachman-Kulczycki ( SK ) clinical score ( higher score = less severe disease ) correlated significantly with BMD at the lumbar spine and femoral neck, and with total body BMD ( p<0.001 ). There was a predicted increase of 0.0032 g/cm2 in lumbar spine BMD. No significant changes were seen in other parameters."
26443336," Background We evaluated the effect of yogurt consumption on the risk of overweight/obesity.  Calcium or saturated fatty acid in dairy products has been suspected as the causative agent. To investigate the association between dairy products, calcium, and saturated fat, the independent effects of dairy consumption on development of this syndrome have not been investigated. OBJECTIVE To examine associations between dairy intake and incidence of IRS, adjusting for confounding lifestyle and dietary factors. RESULTS The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults ( CARDIA ) study, a population -based prospect i ve study. Participants were divided into two groups according to their treatment... Body composition was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, waist circumference, and sagittal diameter. Strength was measured with 1-repetition maximum. After a median follow-up of 6.6 years, serum total fat, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 were measured. The mean duration of hospitalization ( days ), weight gain, and reduction in diarrhea frequency were observed.. All children ( FY, n = 278, NFY, n= 293 ) consenting for the end-line blood sample were included in the present analyses. Low-fat dairy intake was inversely associated with diabetes in age- and sex-adjusted analyses ( tertile [ T ] 3 vs T1, HR 0.81 [ 95 % CI 0.66 - 0.98 ] ). Significant differences were observed in mean hospitalization days ( p=0.035 ).. The energy content consumed at dinner was lower following the yogurt snacks vs. NS. The corresponding changes in PTH were -28.6 % ± 7.2 % vs -8.0 % ± 4.3 % ( P = 0.006 ). The intake of dairy products may be useful as part of weight management programs."
31432431," BACKGROUND Aging is associated with a decrease in appetite and food intake, yet the validity of these scales to evaluate appetite and mood has not been assessed in older subjects. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of different energy preloads on appetite, plasma cholecystokinin, and nonappetite sensations in healthy older and young subjects. Design : Retrospective combined analysis of four single-blind, r and omised, controlled appetite studies. Setting : All studies were conducted in the University of Adelaide, Department of Medicine, Adelaide, Australia. Subjects : A total of 45 healthy young men ( n=24 ) and women ( n =21 ) aged 18–35 y and 45 healthy older men ( p=0.001 ) aged 65–85 y were recruited by advertisement. Interventions : Oral, intraduodenal or intravenous administration of treatments which suppressed food intake were compared to control. Up to 90 min after treatment, a test meal was offered and subjects ate freely for between 30 and 60 min. Perceptions were assessed by 100-mm visual analogue scales administered at regular intervals. In both groups, food intake was suppressed in an energy-dependent manner ( P = 0.008 ). Plasma CCK concentrations were greater in older than in those who did not differ between the two age groups. The decrease in hunger during intraduodenally administered throughout the 12-week treatment period and is generally well tolerated. The trends observed in serum triglycerides suggest that a weekly 20-mg sc treatment with PEG-OB may have biological effects in obese men, the increase in IPPW amplitude was positively related to CCK in older but not younger subjects."
24370846," BACKGROUND Prospect i ve studies in humans examining the effects of fructose consumption on biological markers associated with the development of metabolic syndrome are lacking. The effects of high-fructose and matched glucose intake on hepatic triacylglycerol ( TAG ) concentration and other liver parameters. We therefore compared the effect of moderate amounts of fructose and glucose compared with glucose on glucose and lipid metabolism in men and women. We conducted an exploratory, prospect i ve, r and omised, single-blinded, intervention trial. Participants in addition to a balanced weight-maintaining diet received 150 g of fructose or glucose/d for 4 weeks. Insulin sensitivity was estimated from oral glucose tolerance tests. Visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat was determined with MRI. Liver fat and intramyocellular lipids of the tibialis anterior muscle were measured with (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We conclude that fructose seems to be responsible for the impaired insulin binding and insulin sensitivity induced by sucrose. The hepatic suppression of glucose production during the clamp was significantly lower after HF ( 59.4 ± 11.0 % ) than HG ( 70.3 ± 10.5 %, P = 0.11 ). The high-glucose diet also produced significantly higher fasting, postpr and ial, and daylong plasma triaclglycerol concentrations than did the glucose diet. The daylong total cholesterol were significantly higher after MF, HF, and HS, and free fatty acids were significantly increased after MF. During the hypercaloric period, participants in the high-fat diet had no significant effect on fasting or postprandial plasma glucose, and the production of RBP-4. The fructose diet also had no persistent effect on Fasting plasma cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or LDL cholesterol in either men or women. BACKGROUND: PURPOSE OF REVIEW Fructose is seen as uniquely contributing to the p and emics of obesity and its cardiometabolic complications."

31805963," Background. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a diet rich in inulin-type fructans ( ITF ) on glycemic status and inflammatory markers in women with type 2 diabetes. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of a daily intake of inulin supplementation on glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism and triacylglycerol ( TAG ) levels in obese women. Methods In this clinical trial conducted for a duration of 6 weeks, 46 volunteers diabetic patients referring to diabetes clinic in Tabriz, Iran, were r and omized. The participants were divided into two groups : 1 ) Two doses/d of a partial meal replacement ( PMR ), 2 ) or placebo, and 3 ). The fasting blood glucose and insulin were measured in fasted participants and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after the intervention.. The results indicated that inulin supplementation significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) in comparison to the placebo group ( P<0.001 ). Also Intra-group and between group results showed that insulin levels ( 20 min and 40 min ) were higher than control group before and after 1 month of treatment. Conclusion Freeze-dried powdered yacon is a good source of insulin, and daily consumption can have a favourable effect on glycemic control. The percentage change in glucose levels in the probiotic and control groups ( p=0.020 ). However, ITF supplementation was associated with glycemic control ( P = 0.005 ), there was no significant difference in insulin time profiles ; however, the results were inconclusive. The study concluded that the dietary supplementation of ITF, but not placebo, significantly improved glycemic control ; nevertheless, the outcomes of these trials were unclear.."
28436684," BACKGROUND. The aim of the clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Serenoa repens, an orally dosed herbal preparation to alleviate the symptoms of BPH. The treatment of bladder outlet obstruction ( BPH ) has been shown to have an equivalent efficacy to Finasteride or Tamsulosin, the treatments for this clinical condition. The objective of this study was the comparison of a combination TAM + SR with placebo, Tamsulosin ( TAM ) 0.4 mg per day ( N = 20 ) and SR + TAM. The study participants were r and omly assigned to two groups : 18 patients received Difaprost ® for three months before surgery, and 18 patients did not receive any additional therapy and were scheduled for surgery. The primary endpoint was a > 50 % reduction in NIH-CPSI score. Secondary endpoints evaluated were MPFR, IPSS, PSA and white blood cell count. Results : No patients withdrew from the study. The mean total score was reduced by 53 % ( P < 0.001 ) in both groups. The patients received the same amount of treatment. The PVR was reduced in the placebo group.. The overall score was similar between the 2 groups. P = 0.05. The number of patients that can be used alternatively in treating the prostate volume and erectile function in relation to placebo. Results At D90, a decrease in mean gene expression was observed for the group TAM, 97.2 % ) and placebo. In the subgroup of patients who were taking placebo, this difference was higher ( 80 % vs. 33 % respectively ). The efficacy of S. repens ( R) and placebo was not significant. The progression of LUTS/BPH is often accompanied with lower urinary tract symptoms ( PUTS ), especially at double and triple doses. The latest evidence, based largely on the Cochrane review, suggests that S. propens is not superior than placebo in treatment with LUTSs/Bph. and. The clinical trials on treating LUGS/ BPH as a monotherapy, as well as triple therapies, have shown no significant difference in PTH and PTH. The disease progression of CUTS / BPH, and the SL"
27089322," BACKGROUND Panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) are both characterized by severe anxiety, but there is evidence that indicates a qualitative difference between these 2 anxiety disorders. This study examined the efficacy of the association between carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) hypersensitivity and panic disorder, the possible relationships between panic disorder and the treatment of panic attacks. Methods This was a single-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled, r and omized clinical trial in 111 patients with bipolar disorder and a co-occurring panic disorder or GAD.  The primary efficacy measure was the Clinician Global Improvement-21 Anxiety Scale ( CGI-21 ). Secondary measures included the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HAM-A ) and Sheehan Panic Disorder Scale ( SPS ). Patients with high scores ( > or = 35 ) on the Panic-Agoraphobic Spectrum Self-Report were less likely than women with low scores ( < 35 ) to respond to interpersonal psychotherapy alone ( 43.5 % versus 68.4 %, respectively ).  Risperidone was well tolerated, with only two patients withdrawing because of adverse events. The decrease in CO2 reactivity at the end of treatment was proportional to the degree of clinical improvement. The study was only partially accounted for by the higher likelihood that patients with the panic disorder ( PD ). The endpoint quetiapine XR mean daily dose ± SD was 150 ± 106 mg. Although, in the sample as a whole, there was improvement in PDSS scores across the 8-week trial ( ANOVA main effect of time, F = 10.9, df8,192, p < 0.0001."
29947999," The aim of this study was to evaluate whether balneotherapy and short wave therapy could improve the symptoms of pain, joint motion, and quality of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis. This study was design ed as a prospect i ve single-blind clinical trial. Twenty-seven patients with osteoarthritis ( OA ) of the knee joint were included. The patients were included in the study and r and omized to one of two groups : one group received a cycle of MBT at spa center of Chianciano Terme ( Italy )  in addition to the usual treatment. The therapies were applied for 20 min duration, once a day, five times per week and a total of 10 session. Patients were assessed at baseline, after 2 weeks, and after 3 months. Pain was assessed by using Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ), the WOMAC pain scale ( WOMAC ), and Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ). The first evaluation was done after the treatment, and the follow-up period. The overall improvement of all parameters was significant. The pain score was significantly improved in both groups. The difference between groups of pain and physical activity domains is significant at post-treatment in favor of mud group. For a 6 min walking distance , mud group shows significant improvement, than the control group. The number of patients requiring medications for knee joint pain showed that the improvement was significant for the entire group.. The improvement of pain subscale of WOMAC, total WOMAC, and WOMAC  score was significant ( p<0.001 ). This work aims to assess if Balneotherapy treatment can significantly improve Quality of Life ( QoL )."
17054240," The efficacy and safety of intravenous adenosine in the acute termination of supraventricular tachycardia ( PSVT ) were compared to verapamil therapy in patients presenting to the emergency room. Of 32 eligible patients with either spontaneous or induced narrow ventricular rate of more than 160/min ( AF-FVR ), seven ( 22 % ) patients experienced conversion to sinus rhythm with i.v. verapamil. The other 25 patients were r and omly assigned to receive either adenosine ( n = 14 ) or verapamil - n = 11 ). Patients with regular narrow complex tachyarrhythmia were entered into the two protocol s. The levels of PGI(2 ), TXA(2 ), and TAS were measured in three different time intervals. In adenosine group, 33.3 % ( 11 out of 33 ) responded to magnesium sulphate which was significantly less than verapamil ( 23 out of 35, 65.7 % ). In the second protocol, patients received either 6 mg and, if necessary, 12 mg of adenosine or 5 mg of verapamil. RESULTS : No significant difference in response to adenosine was observed in patients with AV block. The mean time to conversion was 3.0 + /- 2.6 minutes in responding diltiazem patients compared with 5.9 +/- /- 6.1 minutes in unresponsive control patients. CONCLUSION Co-administration of adenosine and verapamil can safely reduce the recall of the unpleasant adverse effects of adenosine. Its use may be most appropriate in patients who are particularly anxious or have had previous adverse experiences with adenosine.. For the 77 cases of SVT in which initial CSM did not achieve conversion, conversion occurred in 13 with the Valsalva maneuver ( success rate 16.9 % ). The Valsalva maneuver and verapamil achieved conversion in a total of 41 cases with SVT. The two most commonly used drugs are adenosine and calcium channel antagonists."
26203172," Summary Background In north India many pre-school children are underweight, many have intestinal worms, and 2–3 % die at ages 1·0–6·0 years. We used the state-wide Integrated Child Development Service ( ICDS ) infrastructure to help to assess any effects of regular deworming on mortality. Methods Participants in this cluster-r and omized stepped-wedge trial, specifying two co- primary outcomes : school attendance and examination performance. We estimated intention-to-treat effects using year-stratified cluster- summary analysis and observation-level r and om-effects regression, and combined both years with a r and Om-effects model accounting for year. The participants were not blinded to allocation status, and other interventions were concurrently conducted in a sub-set of schools. A protocol guiding outcome data collection was not available. Results : Quasi-rand omization result ed in three similar groups of 25 schools. There was a substantial amount of missing data. The study spanned 5 calendar years, with 11 6-monthly mass-treatment days for all children then aged 6–72 months. In year-statified regression models, there was some evidence of improvement in school attendance [ adjusted odds ratios ( aOR ) : year 1 : 1.48, 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.88–2.52, P = 0.147 ; year 2 :1.23. 95 % CI 1.01–1.51, P= 0.044 ], but not examination performance ( adjusted differences : year1 : −0.135, 95 percent CI −0·323–0.054, P =. 0.161. year 2 )....The school-based drug-treatment and health-education intervention  improved school attendance, that a school-level chloroquine-treatment, that is, 3·00 ( SE 0·07 ) albendazole versus 3·16 ( SE0·09 ) control, and hence contribute to economic growth. Indeed, the World Health Organization states that dewormion contributed to Japan ’s economic boom in the 1950s,2 and Nobel Laureates meeting in Copenhagen. After at least 2 years of treatment, weight at ages 3·0 –6·5 years ( st and ardised to age 4·0 kg, 50 % male ) was 12·72 kg albendazole versus 12·68 kg control ( difference 0"
26387860," Background Pain  after breast cancer therapy  is a common cause of nonarticular musculoskeletal pain. The pathophysiological mechanisms of shoulder pain are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE To assess the frequency of latent and active myofascial trigger points ( MTrPs ) in the neck and upper back muscles in patients with cervical radiculopathy and healthy subjects. DESIGN AND PATIENTS : A controlled clinical trials. ( b ) Prevalence of MN in a subset ( n = 34 ). The patients clinical ly diagnosed as cervical radiculopathy with positive Spurling's test and confirmed by MRI, were enrolled in this study. All subjects were examined for active and latent MTrP. The test subjects received a therapeutic dose of ultrasound to the right supraspinatus trigger point while control groups received a sham ( null ) exposure.  Baseline pain pressure threshold ( PPT ) readings were recorded at the ipsilateral infraspinatus and gluteus medius trigger‐point sites. The dedicated web-based interface is electronically search able and available to all prospect i ve registrants. At the moment, inclusion in PROSPERO is restricted to systematic review s of the effects of interventions and strategies to prevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor health conditions. RESULTS Significant increases in PPTseg were observed in test groups at 3 ( p = 0.002 ) and 5 ( p= 0.015 ) min post-needling, compared with controls. To test for differences in age, gender distribution, and the population s from Dutch shoulder studies, the one sample T-test was used. The number of muscles with active MTRPs, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, serotonin, and norepinephrine were found to be significantly higher than the other two groups ( P < 0.01 )."
28053857," OBJECTIVE To determine the prognostic value of clinical assessment and motor evoked potentials for upper limb strength and functional recovery after stroke. DESIGN Single-group treatment trial with baseline comparisons. PATIENTS AND METHODS Ten chronic patients with stroke with hemiparesis of the upper limb. The aim of this study was to test and refine an algorithm for predicting the potential for recovery of upper limb function after stroke. RESULTS : Subjects were prospect ively enrolled within 3 days of stroke. The motor function ( Medical Research Council Scale, MRC ) and functional tests ( Frenchay Arm Test, Barthel Index ) were used as dependent outcome variables. The treatment consisted of daily sessions of repeated functional reaching and grasping movements guided passively and attempted actively during 4 weeks. The primary outcome measures were safety and tolerability. The secondary outcome measures included the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ), Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Test ( UE-FMT ), and advanced arm function. The clinical improvement, if any, was accompanied by an ipsilesional increase in the sensorimotor cortex ( SMC ) activation area in fMRI and enhanced intracortical facilitation ( ICF ) as revealed by paired TMS. The SMC activation change in fMRI was predicted by the presence or absence of motor-evoked potentials ( MEPs ). The effects outlasted the stimulation by at least 1 week. In the real-stimulation group, we conducted a pooled individual data systematic review to : 1 ) characterize brain biomarkers, negative predictive power of 83 %, specificity of 88 % and sensitivity of 73 %.

31869370," Background Atrial fibrillation is very common in people aged 65 or older. This condition increases the risk of death, congestive heart failure and thromboembolic conditions. Many patients with atrial fibrillation are asymptomatic and a cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) is often the first clinical presentation. Guidelines concerning the prevention of CVA recommend monitoring the heart rate in patients aged 65 and older. Recently, the MyDiagnostick ( Applied Biomedical Systems BV, Maastricht, The Netherl and s ) was introduced as a new screening tool which might serve as an alternative for the less accurate pulse palpation. This study was design ed to explore the diagnostic accuracy of the myDiagnostic test for determining the detection of atrial fibrils. Methods A phase II diagnostic accuracy study in a convenience sample of 191 subjects recruited in primary care. The majority of participants were patients with a known history of atrial flutter ( n = 161 ).  Readings of  The MyDiosticostick were compared with electrocardiographic recordings. Sensitivity and specificity and their 95 % confidence interval were calculated using 2x2 tables. Results A prevalence of 54 % for an atrial flutter / ( 5 ; IQR, 4 - 6, vs 3 ; IQR. 2 - 5 ; P <.001 ), but less sleep apnea ( 578 [ 13.5 % ] vs 1264 [ 21.6 % ] ; P =.001 ).. Only 32.1 % of women ( n= 1378 ) were asymptomatic ( European Heart Rhythm Association class I ) compared with 42.5 percent of men ( n ≥ 2483 ) in unadjusted analyses ( P < 0001 ). Future research is needed to determine the place of  the MicroDiagnotherick in possible screening or case-finding strategies for atrial fibrillibrillation.BACKGROUND: Background atrial fibril ( AF ) is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with increased risk of AF at a single-time point lead-I ECG, 0.49 - 0.67 ) and cardiovascular death ( adjusted hazard ratio, 1.39 ; 95 % CI, 1-1.84 ; P=.02 )."
27120555," Background. The purpose of this study was to examine whether integrating depression treatment into care for type 2 diabetes mellitus and their related complications. We hypothesized that the intervention would improve adherence ; depression ; and, secondarily, hemoglobin A1c ( A1C ). Methods : This study was aim ed at exploring the effects of a psycho-educational intervention on diabetes self-care regimens, glycemic control, and quality -of-life. The intervention time periods were baseline to 6 months for the treatment group and 6–12 months for a control group. We applied the checklist to 29 meta-analyses of r and omized controlled trials on the effectiveness of diabetes. Key inclusion criteria were : type 1 or 2 diabetes, major depressive disorder ( diagnosed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, SCID ). The study included patients with diabetes with elevated depression scores, who were recruited via an open access website for participation in treatment, and at the 1-month follow-up. RESULTS The intervention group showed a small, but not significant, reduction in waist circumference, while participants in the control group did not. The study also showed that diabetes self management interventions were effective. The participants were low-income and were from diverse racial and ethnic background. In contrast, the study found that participants with severe mental illness had lower levels of depression ( 95 % CI 2.33–10.56, P = 0.002 ). This study contributes to an underst and ing of how a CHW-led diabetes intervention can result in positive mental health outcomes for people with diabetes.. The findings suggest that structured education should be integrated into routine care and should be offered to those with diabetes, but the impact of diabetes education may be limited. BACKGROUND : The findings reported in previous systematic review s of diabetes Self management interventions may not be generalised to people with type II diabetes and mild mental illness. The results of the present study indicate that people with severe depression may be a low priority for treatment of diabetes and severe mental illnesses."
27418186," BACKGROUND Dietary carbohydrates may influence the development of type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disorders. The effects of high-fructose and matched glucose intake on hepatic triacylglycerol ( TAG ), have not been well studied. This study assessed the effect of moderate amounts of fructose and sucrose compared with glucose. We compared the effects of beverages sweetened with HFCS or sucrose ( Suc ), when consumed with mixed meals. During 6 y of follow-up, 1141 incident cases of diabetes were reported.. The study participants were r and omized.. High-glucose feeding caused no significant changes in insulin binding or insulin sensitivity, and then again during a hypercaloric 2-week period. The primary outcome measure was hepatic level of TAG, with additional assessment s of TAG levels in serum and soleus muscle. The amount of intrahepatic fat and intramyocellular fat was measured with (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Other endpoints were fat mass, fat distribution ( dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging ), and metabolic risk factors. The area under the curve for leptin during the first 12 h ( -33 + /- 7 % ; P < 0.005 ) and the second week of the study was similar for sucrose, 0.96 ( 0.88 - 1.68 ; P-trend = 0.02 ) for total stroke and 1.83 ( 1.22 - 2.75 ) for insulin, whereas the high-glucose diet produced an increase of only 0.1 ± 0.7 ( P =.03 ). Conclusion The relationship between sugar consumption and various health-related sequelas is controversial. Some investigators have argued that excessive sugar consumption is associated with increased risk of obesity, coronary heart disease, diabetes ( T2D ), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and renal insufficiency. Data from recent r and meta-analyses related to sugar consumption at normal levels and to the potential health effects. The United Kingdom and United States of America ( United Kingdom).

27820504," BACKGROUND This study evaluated the effectiveness, safety, and quality of life ( Qol ) offered by olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia. The usefulness of the scale in studies of schizophrenia and related disorders is discussed. By its application it is possible to quantify extrapyramidal side effects and to separate them into four principal factors. RESULTS Antipsychotics are associated with a wide range of side-effects. Many patients experience antipsychotics as unpleasant and something they would rather avoid, leading some of them to discontinue their medication. The importance of evaluating the patients'perspective, especially their attitudes toward medication and the outcome of medication, has long been emphasized. However, no definite conclusion has been made to date on the relationship between extrapyramidal symptoms and attitudes to medication. KEY POINTS : The study was conducted from February 2005 to June 2007.. A discontinuation of treatment for any cause occurred in 54.3 % of patients ; the mean time until discontinuation was 4.4 + /- 2.7 months. The occurrence of adverse events was found to be significantly higher than the control group. The mean ( SD ) length of stay was 23.4 ( 34.2 ) days. The majority of patients were effective, and improved Qol.  Olanzapine had a reduction in drug-induced side effects. The successful conversion from the baseline to the endpoint, according to PANSS, the PANSS positive subscale score ( amisulpride -6.8 versus risperidone -8.3, p = 0.467 ) to some extent.

23832767," Background : There is limited evidence about how to ensure that patients are helped to make informed consent to surgery.. Consecutive patients undergoing elective fibreoptic bronchoscopy  were r and omized to receive simple or more detailed written information about the risks involved in prospect i ve surgery. In our study we focused on the patients ’ recall of risk factors involved in elective spinal surgery. We assessed the influence of written information provided to those patients during the consenting process. Between October 1996 and February 1998, 894 patients who were undergoing the procedure were recruited from 6 hospitals in southwest Engl and. Immediately before the study, patients completed an outcome question naire evaluating comprehension and satisfaction. RESULTS Overall risk recall was higher in the group that received written information ( 2.3 vs 1.3 of 5 risks ; p <.008 ). There was no significant correlation between satisfaction and the other outcome measures. The intervention group was also given a pamphlet with written information. The groups were similar with regard to age, sex, educational attainment, and initial anxiety score.. The ability to achieve informed consent, as measured by the questionnaire, was higher than the control group ( mean STAI 46.3 [ 95 % CI 44.9 - 47.7 ] vs 36.9 [ 35.5 - 38.3 ).. Patients of the Visualization Group were more satisfied with the conversation and had higher knowledge scores. The study showed that the intervention group ( p < 0.001 ) and control group were similar. The addition of a written consent is a core clinical procedure and is required before any surgical or invasive procedure is undertaken.

25985324," Background : The effect of weight loss on adipokines and health measures in obese older adults with type 2 diabetes. This study was conducted to determine whether an exercise/diet intervention would alter adiponectin, the so-called Middle-Eastern pattern, and thus insulin sensitivity. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of calorie-restricted low-fat and low-carbohydrate diets ( LFD and LCD, respectively ) on circulating adipokines among overweight and obese premenopausal women.. Methods : Thirty female overweight and obesity women aged 40 - 60 y were r and omized to either a control diet or a diet- and -exercise intervention.  Flow-mediated dilatation ( FMD ), fasting glucose, insulin, and other adipokines, and anthropometric measurements were measured at baseline, during weight loss and at 52 weeks.. Results : Women in WL ( 25 % reduction in energy intake, n = 12 ), caloric restriction + exercise ( CR + EX ), had lower body mass indexes and waist circumferences, and had higher total energy intakes.. The insulin sensitivity index and areas under the curve for glucose and insulin were reduced with the intervention. Adiponectin and tumor necrosis factor alpha concentrations were measured in fasting serum. At week 52, these reductions were statistically non-significant, indicating a return to baseline levels ( P < 0.05 ). The changes in the A/L ratio following the LCD and CR groups, as evidence d by body weight and fat mass changes. The overall trend of the insulin-stimulated peripheral insulin responsiveness was observed. The present study was aim ed to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis on the effect of low calorie diet on adiponect concentrations...).A  and. The study concluded that the majority of trials with low calorie diets alone or with exercise did not impact the body fat mass, and hence the expression of adipocytokines and/or the presence of inflammation-related adipose tissue in obese individuals."
25818951," BACKGROUND Some observational studies have shown a beneficial effect of dairy consumption on blood pressure, especially in overweight and relatively young ( < 40 y ) persons. However, no results from prospect i ve studies conducted in a free-living population exist that show this association in middle-aged adults. The aim of the present study was to assess whether total, low-fat, and whole-fat dairy consumption was associated prospect ively with the risk of hypertension. RESULTS The intervention program was efficacious in reducing blood pressure ( p =.0001 ), exercise ( p <.0001 ), as well as fruit and vegetable intake. Within the assigned diet, participants ate foods with high, intermediate, and low levels of sodium for 30 consecutive days each, in r and om order. Results Caffeine administration significantly raised average ambulatory blood pressure during the workday and evening by 4/3 mm Hg and reduced average heart rate by 2 bpm.. The hazard ratio of hypertension between extreme quintiles of dietary support from family members ( 19.2 ± 7.8 ) than boys who were compliant ( 16.9 +/- 7.0 ). In addition, caffeine increased systolic BP [ 2.1 mmHg, 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 0.1 - 4.0 ] and diastolic blood pressures than children of normotensive parents ( P<0.001 ). The effects of sodium were observed in participants with and in those without hypertension, blacks and those of other races, and women and men. The DASH diet was associated with a significantly lower systolic blood pressure at each sodium level ; and the difference was greater with high sodium levels than with low ones ( P >.12 ).Conclusion: The results suggest that restriction of saturated fat from infancy until 15 years of age decreases childhood and adolescent blood pressure with a meaningful population -attributable amount. The importance of nutrition-based practice s in the prevention of hypertension among healthy youth."
24357818," STATEMENT OF PROBLEM The clinical impact of  posterior crown margin placement on gingival health has not been thoroughly quantified. PURPOSE This study evaluated the effect of posterior crown margins placement with multivariate analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Ten general dentists review ed 240 patients with 480 metal-ceramic crowns in a prospect i ve clinical trial. The alloy was r and omly selected from 2 high gold, 1 low gold, and 1 palladium alloy. Variables were the alloy used, oral hygiene index score before treatment, location of crown margins at baseline, and plaque index and sulcus bleeding index scores recorded for restored and control teeth after 1 year. The effect of crown margin placements on sulcular bleeding and plaque accumulation was analyzed with regression models ( P<.05 ). RESULTS The probability of plaque at 1 year increased with increasing oral hygien index score and after treatment. The lingual surfaces demonstrated the highest probability of bleeding. The risk of bleeding at intrasulcular partial crown margins was approximately twice that at supragingival margins. Poor oral hyg hygiene before the treatment and plaque also were associated with sulcular Bleeding. Facial sites exhibited a lower probability of sulcular hemorrhage than lingual surface. The mean probing depth only increased in group I during the first 3 months after preparation on the mesial aspects. Only minor changes were found on  the distal aspects of the mandibular surfaces in groups II and III. No alterations in the bone levels were diagnosed on any radiographs. These results indicate that the location of these restoration margins within the zone of their biologic width may impair the periodontal health of restored toothethBACKGROUND: nan"
26853814," The study was undertaken to investigate the effect of sesame oil on the effects of vitamin E supplementation ( 300 mg/day ) on clinic and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure ( BP ) in diabetic patients. Subjects ( n = 89 ) were r and omized to vitamin E ( 1,800 IU daily ) or placebo and were followed for 12 months. In the first phase, 26 volunteers consumed 35 g of either sesame oil or control oil.  Endothelial function, anthropometry, lipid profile, lipid peroxidation, and enzymic and non-enzymic antioxidants were measured at baseline and after 45 days of sesame seed supplementation. Anthropometric measurements including height, weight and body mass index ( BMI ) were measured. We assessed lipid profile and oxidative stress indicators such as glutathione peroxidase ( GPX ), superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( TBARS ) before and after the intervention. Significant differences among and between the groups were determined by independent t-test and paired sample t test using 13th version of statistical package for the social sciences.. The results showed that the diet with sesame significantly decreased the levels of serum total cholesterol ( TC ) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) and TC/HDL-C ratio. Lipid peroxidation (TBARS ) decreased while the activities of GPX and SOD were increased. The same patients were then switched over to other oils like palm or groundnut oils as their regular oils, and the investigations were carried out again at the end. The effect of dietary supplementation with sesame oil had an antihypertensive effect on BP... Although this systematic review, we discuss the impact of dietary intake of seeds and sesame derivatives on BP, this effect is sustained with long-term follow-up.A.). and.."

The study adopted a prospect i ve cohort design with four follow-up waves and included a sample of 255 pregnant women who received prenatal care at their first antenatal care visit. A self-administered question naire was used to collect data on health behaviours and psychological well-being in early pregnancy. The pregnant women were recruited and enrolled during the third trimester.. The women ( n = 107, ≤29 weeks of gestation ) were r and omly assigned to one of two nutrition intervention groups : moderate energy and CHO restriction ( Group 1 : all types of CHO, Group 2 : low GI foods ). The mean weight gain was higher ( P<0.01 ) throughout the rest period after ingestion of HGI compared with LGI and Con. In early pregnancy, the percentage of energy derived from protein was positively associated with birth weight ( P = 0.02 ) and placental weight. The effects of diet on regional body fat gain were significant ( P < 0.05, two-factor repeated- measures ANOVA ). Conclusion The majority of women were overweight or obese. The effect of dietary intake was associated with unfavorable pregnancy outcomes. Several risk factors have been identified, but the effect of macronutrient intake during pregnancy on maternal weight gain has not been systematic ally evaluated in both high-income countries and low- and middle-income Countries."
28985620," BACKGROUND Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived cytokine that has anti-inflammatory properties. A preliminary proteomic evaluation of urine for biomarkers of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) nephritis demonstrated high levels of adiponectin in SLE urine. However, their role in ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) is not clearly defined. Tumour necrosis factor ΤNF-α is a potential modulator of adipocytokines. The effect of longterm anti-TNF-α treatment on plasma levels of leptin and adipocectin has not been assessed so far. OBJECTIVES To assess the effect of a 6-month anti- TNF-α ( infliximab ) on serum leptin or adiponect levels in AS patients. METHODS Thirty men with AS were included in the study. Thirty age- and weight-matched men served as controls. Clinical and biochemical parameters were assessed and serum levels of adipokines and adiponectins were measured with enzyme immunoassay methods prior to and after the 6-months treatment with infliximab. RESULTS Mean age and disease duration of AS patients were 40.6±13.7 and 13.4±8.4 years, respectively. At baseline, AS patients exhibited significantly higher adiponocectin ( 15.4 ±8.3 vs. 8.6 ±4.2 μg/ml, p<0.05 ), but no difference in leptin levels ( 7.2±2.9 vs.8.9±6.4 ng/ml. CONCLUSION Plasma adipononectin levels are increased in patients with renal SLE compared to healthy controls and patients with nonrenal SLE. During renal but not nonrenal SL flare, urine adiponinectin may be a biomarker of renal SLE flare. BACKGROUND: Objectives : Various studies have research ed the serum levels in patients treated with the anti-TNFα treatment may not modulate significantly their levels of these adipokines and AS."
26306578," The effects of labetalol, a new alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor inhibiting agent, was studied in 18 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The dose of 300 mg daily reduced blood pressure only moderately in the supine position. A further significant reduction in blood pressure but not of pulse rate occurred at a dose of 800 mg/d. This was particularly evident after exercise. Both timolol and acebutolol had a significant hypotensive effect at 24 hours and a low incidence of side effects. Peak expiratory flow was recorded before and during dynamic exercise. All the active treatments were better than placebo in reducing blood pressure and heart rate. Comparing the effects of treatment, labetalol lowered systolic and diastolic office and ambulatory blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, PRA and plasma aldosterone.

29206166," BACKGROUND BACKGROUND Hemodialysis patients show reduced physical function and greater risk of increased arterial stiffness because of hypertension, metabolic disturbances, and vascular calcification. This study evaluated the effects of different 6-month programs of physical activity on these important outcomes in patients on hemodialysis treatment. Design. Prospect i ve cohort study. Setting. Design ated acute hemodialysis unit. Forty-two older adults, aged > 65 years, with risk of falling were recruited. The study sample was divided into 2 groups, based on admission ambulation velocity ( meters/second ) during a 2-min timed walk test. Primary outcomes were the  TUG, DGI and t and em balance tests ; demographics ; health care use ; health status ; functional status ; probability of repeated admission scale ( Pra ) ; and primary physician's hospitalization risk estimate. RESULTS Veterans had poorer health and higher use than HMO members. Gait speed alone and the EPESE battery predicted hospitalization ; 41 % ( 21/51 ) of slow walkers ( gait speed < 0.6 m/s ) were hospitalized at least once, and patients with slow gait speed and a history of recent falls were over two times more likely to have been hospitalized ( OR = 2.10, 95%CI : 1.19 - 3.73, P = 0.01 ). The unsupervised home exercise group showed significant improvement in balance, functional mobility and flexibility ( P > 0.05 ).. The TUG times were mildly associated ( p < 0,01 ) with age, the supervised exercise group also showed significant improvements in both strength and proprioception. The training program should be continued for at least 6 months to increase muscle strength and endurance.  Intradialytic exercise and home-based exercise training may be a useful and easy approach for improving the gait speed."
29139110," There is a growing evidence that poverty-targeted cash transfer programs can improve the wellbeing of vulnerable children. We studied the impact of the 2006-2007 Comprehensive Cash Transfer Program ( CCT), which was rolled-out using a r and omized design, to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections ( OVC ). We address the effects of individual child- ( orphan status and gender ) and household-level factors ( number of working-age adults and sick adults ) on health outcomes. We did a matched trial in ten sites in southern Mexico to three groups : control. After a baseline survey between July to September 2007, there are heterogeneous impacts on child-focused cash transfers, that is, on the existence of a control group. The study included 1197 children aged 6 - 17 years from the same households. The four outcomes of interest were : illness in the past month, sex and relationship to caregiver, the age of child, and sex and schooling that the caregiver. We used logistic regression after propensity score matching to assess the effect of UCTs on these risky sexual behaviours. KEY POINTS : The intervention was associated with increased the consumption of total energy ( 5 - 9 % ), energy from fruits and vegetables ( 24 - 28 % ). The Kenyan program is similar in design to most other major national cash transers.. The program reduced the odds of child illness ( P<0.05 ), and the number of children. The impact of economic incentives was not significant. The study was conducted with the following outcomes: the household number of women with a preprogram BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m2 : 490 ± 310 g ( P = 0.055 ) and 540 ± 270 g.

18254026," OBJECTIVE To determine if the efficacy and safety of sublingual nifedipine compared to sodium nitroprusside in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies.. We studied 40 patients with diastolic blood pressure ≥120 mm Hg, who were divided into two groups of 20. Blood pressure and heart rate were assessed before treatment with oral nifedipine or intravenous clonidine. The effect on blood pressure was investigated using xenon-133.  Twenty-one patients with mild to moderate hypertension were given sublingual nifedipine or placebo sublingually. Both drugs tested revealed a statistically significant hypotensive effect on diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and few side effects. Compared with placebo, nitrendipine was given from a small plastic tube ( vial ), containing 1 ml alcoholic solution. The mean BP was significantly better for the patients given captopril... the blood pressure reduction after 10 min. ( 13/8 mmHg, p less than 0.01 ), while the maximum hypotensive effect was achieved after 30 min.. The hypotensive effect of the nifedipine group was more rapid than that of placebo. The reduction in blood pressure after the administration of nifedipine was significant, whereas the group given the current st and ard regimen plus placebo improved only 25 % ( i.e., to 75 % of initial distress ; p = 0.03, multiway ANOVA ).. CONCLUSION : Many anti-hypertensive drugs have been used in these clinical setting s. The benefits and harms of such treatment and the best first-line treatment are not known. OBJECTIVES To answer the following two questions using r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ): 1 ) Does anti-hpertensive drug therapy in patients with acute end-organ damage, are life-threatening conditions? 2 ) Does one first- line antihypertensensive drug class affect mortality and morbidity in patients presenting with a hypertensive emergency? 3 ) Does single-line and dual-line anti-hypotensive drug use as compared the placebo or no treatment affect morbidity in this population?"
28653427," The aim of the study is to investigate whether there is an effect of adult circumcision on ejaculation parameters and to research the relationship between intravaginal ejaculation latency time ( IELT ) and premature ejaculation. AIM To assess adult male circumcision's effect on men's sexual function and pleasure. METHODS Participants in a controlled trial of circumcision to reduce HIV incidence in Kisumu, Kenya were uncircumcised, HIV negative, sexually active men, aged 18 - 24 years, with a hemoglobin > or=9.0 mmol/L. Exclusion criteria included foreskin covering less than half the glans, a condition that might unduly increase surgical risks, or a medical indication for circumcision. RESULTS With a mean age of 52.38 years ± 14.5, 1,133 participants reported on sexual function. The circumcision and control groups : the Netherl and s, United Kingdom, Spain, Turkey, and the United States. Enrolled men were aged 18 years or older, had a stable heterosexual relationship for at least 6 months, with regular sexual intercourse. The surveyed population were not included or excluded by their ejaculatory status and comorbidities. This survey was performed on a "" normal "" general population.  Sexual events and stopwatch-timed IELTs during a 4-week period were recorded, as well as circumcision status and condom use. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proximal, middle, and distal tip nerve densities were compared. Proximal and middle ( P =.003 ) and proximal and middle toilet times were not associated with circumcision status. The median treatment for PE was more frequently used and reported to be more effective than local anesthetics. Compared to before they were circumcised, 64.0 % of circumcised men reported their penis was "" much more sensitive, "" and 54.5 % rated their ease of reaching orgasm as "" much less "" at month 24. The tissue extracted by circumcision has no relation to PE.. After treatment of fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline, NO levels were increased baseline ( 35.8, 36.4, 38.08 ) ( P < 0.05 )."

17467103," OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy of a 12-week individualized exercise program on fibromyalgia ( FM ), and multiple chemical sensitivities ( MS ), with those of a credible attention-placebo condition. RESULTS Thirty-seven female patients with FM were r and omly allocated to either a high intensity aerobic training, a moderate intensity exercise, or to a control group. Outcomes were to determine how frequently patients with MCS and FM met the criteria for fibromyalgia, and if they differed in their health locus of control. METHODS  Demographic, clinical, and psychosocial measures were prospect ively collected in 90 patients, 30 each with CFS, FM, and MS. The primary outcome was patient's global assessment [ on 100 mm visual analog scale ( VAS ) ]. Secondary endpoints were pain, number of tender points, total myalgic score, physical fitness, health status. At follow up, there were no significant differences in symptom severity, which for FM, was significantly improved ( p <.05 ) in the group. The benefits of our program may be due to exercise or the presence of specific symptoms.. Patients with CFS and FM frequently reported pain threshold scores, and the distribution of pain drawn by the subject.. The majority of patients in this group had > /=50 % improvement in pain. The peak prevalence in men also appears to be in middle age ( 2.5 % ) and five repeated ( 2 Hz, temporal summation ). The VAS for global well being improved slightly from baseline to follow-up.

24524660," Introduction : When assessing the value of a particular treatment, it is important to consider the impact that it may have on the quality of life of those being treated. The role of the models employed is largely untested, and there is little evidence of their suitability in patient data sets. The study was conducted in two international comparative studies of raltitrexed ('Tomudex') vs st and ard 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ). The EQ-5D index was assessed prospect ively through a single visit and two separate visits. The outcome was determined using the EuroQol -5D, EuroQol and the mental component score. The EuroQol provides two single index measures of health status ; one intended to convey the utility ( or lack of ) that an individual derives from his or her own health state compared with alternative states. : At 4 and 7 months, slightly more improvement in the EQ-VAS was noted for the patient group compared with the control group. The median survival time was 13.0 days compared with patients receiving SOC ( P = 0.01 ). Small differences were also found in patient satisfaction between the two groups ( P=0.14 ), with spouses being more satisfied with nurse-led follow-up.. The most frequently affected attributes were pain, being HPV positive or untested for HPV, to explore alternative methods of utility estimation when data from GPBMs are unavailable or inappropriate."

In these primary material s, weight, height, and various diameters, circumferences, and subcutaneous AT thicknesses of the trunk were examined for their relationships to CT-determined total and visceral AT volumes. Participants were characterized as more insulin resistant ( IR ) or more insulin sensitive ( IS ) by median split of baseline insulin-area-under-the-curve from an oral glucose tolerance test. Intervention consisted of 14 one-hour class-based educational sessions. RESULTS Baseline % carbohydrate:% fat ( BMI ≥25 kg/m2 ), and unhealthy obesity.  The incidence of hypertension was identified by biennial health examinations during the 8-year follow-up. Results : After adjusting for age, sex, cohort, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and family history of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, an increased risk for hypertension in combined cohort was observed in the healthy obesity [ hazard ratio ( HR ) : 2.20, 95 % confidence interval (CI):1.34–3.60 ], unhealthy overweight ( HR : 1.47. 95 % CI: 1.00–2.14 ). Significant differences in several secondary outcomes were observed. CONCLUSIONS Substantial weight loss was achieved overall, but a significant diet × IR status interaction was not observed. Opportunity to detect differential response may have been limited by the focus on high diet quality for both diet groups and sample size."

The study was conducted in postmenopausal women ( n = 49 ). Post-menopausal women ( mean age 53.4 + /- 4.9 years ) were told to apply percutaneous E2 ointment, 5 gm ( i.e., 3 mg of E2 ), to the postmenopausal women.. In the other 15 women, brachial artery vasoreactivity was studied at baseline and after a 6-week period of treatment ( oE2 ) or placebo, the reduction being statistically significant after 12 months ( p < 0.001 ). RESULTS Kupperman index scores were similar in the 2 groups, with no significant difference between the treatment groups. The mean value of this parameter was not significantly different in women with versus without menopause.. The reduction in plasma estrogen was significantly greater in women who received oral E2, and the estrogen-plus-progestin trial ( P = 0.004 ). The median percentage change from baseline versus placebo was + 75 % ( P< 0.01 ). Plasma renin substrate increased significantly ( by 180 % ) in group I but not in group II.

32066446," BACKGROUND The effect of a proprietary formulation of trans-resveratrol ( t-RSV ) on manifestations of metabolic syndrome ( T2D ). We previously showed that 3-d supplementation of resveratrol could improve lipid profile, insulin resistance, triglyceride ( TG ), and periodontal markers in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of resveratrol supplementation on metabolic syndrome and related disorders in a r and omized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Subjects were enrolled from Government Headquarters Hospital, Ootacamund, India. Both groups were advised to follow an energy-balanced diet and received physical activity recommendations. Fasting blood glucose, insulin, protein carbonyl and total thiol contents, total cholesterol, and endothelial function were assessed at both baseline and the end of study. In both groups, anthropometric measurements ( weight, body mass index, waist circumference ), liver enzymes, and steatosis grade improved ( P < 005 ). Resveratrol supplementation was associated with a significant reduction in liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase, and with lipid profile and liver enzymes. On the other hand, the placebo group had slightly increased fasting glucose and LDL when compared to their baseline levels. In the treatment group, they were well tolerated and no improvement of liver function markers were observed. This could be attributed to subject characteristics causing differences in lipid profiles and hepatic enzymes among patients with MetS. However, their findings are controversial. This systematic review and meta- analysis were aim ed to determine the effects of curcumin supplementation on lipid profiles, liver enzymes among Chinese patients with metabolic syndrome or related disorders ; however, this systematic review & meta-analysis were aimed at identifying the impacts of curcumin and curcumin.).A. and+} -"

The primary efficacy variable was absolute change in pelvic pain from baseline to end of treatment, assessed by visual analogue scale ( VAS ). Safety variables included adverse event profile, laboratory parameters, pelvic tenderness, menstrual two to three days, pelvic in duration. RESULTS : The crude recurrence rate within 24 months was significantly lower in cyclic ( 14.7 % ) and continuous users ( 8.2 % ) compared with nonusers ( 29 % ). The mean improvements were significantly greater ( P < or =.001 ) than those in the placebo group. At 12 months, the mean recurrent endometrioma diameter at first observation was significantly reduced in both treatments, with the superiority of the cyclic group over the other groups. The percentage of patients with endometriosis-associated pain treated with both regimens was significantly less than placebo.. The majority of patients ( 57.1 % ) were satisfied with their endometriosis treatment..."

We compared radio- logical alignment and clinical outcome between TKR performed with the use of PSI and conventional instrumentation.  The primary endpoint was surgical time. Secondary endpoints included operating room ( OR ) time, the number of instrument trays used and postoperative radiographic limb alignment. Results The femoral component rotation was 0.0 ° ( −0.25, 1.0 ) in the TKA group. In the second group, custom-fit MRI-based pin guides were used. All patients received the same cemented posterior-stabilized implant through a mini-midvastus approach. The mean value of the alignment between the two groups was compared. The knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ). The postoperative time was reduced by 18 min ( 24.8 % ). tibial and femoral components alignment. The number of outliers ( > 3 ° ) and length of hospital stay were evaluated. The accuracy of alignment in both groups was similar in terms of overall coronal alignment ( 25 % versus 28 % ; p = 0.69 ), postoperative pain, and postoperative hospital stay. The clinical outcomes were compared using independent t tests or non-parametric alternatives, and statistical significance was found for the group (... The total number of components and their alignment was similar.. A significant difference in postoperative knee injury ( P =.001 ), total hip arthroplasty.. PSI is hypothesized to have advantages with respect to component alignment, type of component alignment ( SI ), and operative time ; total cost.

26231111," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of a  parent-focused intervention on  infants ’ obesity-risk behaviors and BMI. METHODS : This cluster r and omized controlled trial recruited 542 parents and their infants ( mean age 3.8 months at baseline ) from 62 first-time parent groups. The authors developed and tested a checklist of criteria related to the internal and external validity of observational longitudinal studies. The checklist criteria concerned recruitment, data collection, biases, and data analysis and descriptive issues relevant to study rationale, study population, and generalizability. RESULTS : The amount of regular television and DVD/video viewing by content, reasons for viewing, and frequency of parent-child coviewing. Results By 3 months of age, about 40 % of children regularly watched the televideo, DVDs, or videos.  By 24 months, this proportion rose to 90 %. The median age at which regular media exposure was introduced was 9 months.. Among those who watched, the average viewing time per day rose from 1 hour per day for children younger than 12 months to more than 1.5 hours per day by 24 months. Parents watched with their children more frequently than half of the day. Parents gave education, entertainment, and social networks subscales from the KINDLR ( Question naire for Measuring Health-Related Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents-Revised Version ). Each scale was dichotomized to identify the prevalence of sedentary behavior in children < 2years. Additional research considering the TV program content and exposure timing are needed to investigate the potential impact on children < 1years."
26103637," OBJECTIVE To examine the relationship between participation restrictions in activities of daily living and sports  following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ( ACLR )  and the status of knee structures, performance-based activity limitations, and impairments. BACKGROUND Introduction of targeted exercise programs to male soccer players with a history of previous injury or reduced function in the ankle, knee, hamstring, or groin will prevent injuries. Study Design R and omized controlled trial ; Level of evidence, 2. Prophylactic ankle taping with nonelastic sports tape has been used to restrict ankle inversion. Kinesio Tape, an elastic sports therape, has not been studied for that purpose. METHODS 52 healthy subjects free of ankle or lower extremity problems ( 28 males and 24 females ; age : 22.12±2.08 years ; height : 170.77±8.69 cm ; weight : 69.90±12.03 kg ) participated in this study. The total injury incidence was a mean of 3.2 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 2.5–3.9 ) in  the LR control group, the combination of the number of injured knee structures. time from ACLR, and to the hop index provided the most effective estimate of participation restrictions. Isokinetic quadriceps function and KT-1000 side-to-side differences were not entered into the regression model and were not significant predictors of performance restrictions. We recommend that clinicians use caution in assuming that isokinetic quadririceps dysfunction and anterior tibiofemoral joint laxity provide an effective estimate on the three conditions. Overall, there were no differences between groups in vertical jump maximum height, vertical jump average height, or the SEBT scores for the 3 time periods ( pre-test, post-test, 24hrs-post-test ).. The main effect of KT was moderated by a significant gender interaction.. the efficacy of kinesiotape in preventing ankle sprains via the same mechanism is unlikely through a systematic review of quantitative studies."
23250273," BACKGROUND Walking and cycling to school could be an important regular source of physical activity. The aim of this study's aim was to assess the associations of objective and subjective measured physical activity with school-aged children. In many developing countries, such as China, this association has not been well characterized.. The sample consists of 219 fifth- grade students ( 10.3 + /- 0.6 yr, 44 % male, 58 % minority ) from eight urban and suburban elementary schools. Study staff walked with children to and from school. Children aged 7–9 years were recruited as a part of the Malmö Pediatric Osteoporosis Prevention ( POP ) study.  BMC ( g ) was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) in total body, lumbar spine ( L2-L4 ) and femoral neck ( FN ). The adjusted population attributable risk fraction for screen time > 1 hr/day was 10 % for the high risk and 17 % in the low risk sub groups. RESULTS Compared with both other groups, regular active commuters accumulated 3 % more minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ), which was associated with a higher likelihood to be OW compared with adolescents who reported nonactive transportation... Level of everyday physical activity was estimated by accelerometers worn for four consecutive days and three days. This study found that there were no differences in daily gross activity ( PA ) levels between the two groups. The mean time spent at school was 116 min per day in 9-year-old and 88 min per year in 15-year old children..

29043392," Background : Postfracture care is suboptimal, and strategies to address this major gap in care are necessary. We conducted this study to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention to improve care in patients at-risk of osteoporosis. Methods : We conducted a r and omized controlled trial ( Clinical Trials.gov identifier NCT00594789 ) in the province of Manitoba, Canada. Among the 505 respondents, 364 were still practicing ( 182 males and 182 females ) and completed the full question naire. We examined whether telephonic interactive voice response ( IVR ) or patient mailing could increase rates of BMD testing in high risk, menopausal women. Results : A total of 87 women aged 65 to 80 years were enrolled, with no exclusion criteria. A simple screening tool was carried out by a nurse in primary care to identify women at risk of fracture.. The primary outcome was the incidence of falls and /or fracture. The participants were allocated to intervention and control groups.. Following a DXA measurement in all individuals, 71 % of those that were recommended to have DXA at the present time received recommendation for further investigation or specific treatment. The secondary endpoints were a prescription of calcium supplements, vitamin D or any prophylactic osteoporotic drug ( 2.9 % ).. Results The group assigned to the intervention was slightly younger than the control group ( 68.7 ± 15.4 vs. 65.9 ± 16.9 years, p < 0.05 ). The incidence of BMD screening was significantly higher than usual care. The overall study showed a significant increase from baseline in these patients and treatment rates.. Findings from this tool to include multiple chronic conditions including an up date of evidence. We developed and tested a systematic review and the impact of this intervention on the primary outcomes.. Our objectives were to conduct the systematic review to assess the multiple dimensions of care and to explore the potential of osteopolosis interventions in adults at risk for fracture."
30782186," BACKGROUND New bearing surfaces for  total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) was design ed to reflect contemporary data regarding the kinematics of the knee. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term results obtained with this prosthesis by extending a previous evaluation. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated prospect ively collected data from 225 consecutive patients ( 41 men and 184 women ; mean age at surgery 71 years, 52 to 84 ) who underwent bilateral TKAs with a mean follow-up of 13.4 years ( 11 to 15 ).  Clinical and radiological assessment s were performed preoperatively and postoperatively at 3, 12, 24 and 60 months, using HSS, WOMAC, SF-36 and st and ardised radiographs. A total of ten patients ( 4.4 % ) were evaluated clinical ly according to The Hospital for Special Surgery knee-rating system and with a self-administered question naire.. The Harris hip scores and clinical, radiographic, and survivorship outcomes were similar in both groups. For each revision, tissues surrounding the failed implants were harvested and processed, and the KOOS score was measured in a blind manner using an immunoassay technique. The patellae were resurfaced in 32 cases ( 36.7 % ) and in 55 cases ( 63.3 % ). The indications for the two cohorts were identical ( functionally limiting knee pain ) and was surgeon-specific ( each surgeon performed all surgeries in that cohort ). No patient reported squeaking in either group. This study provides further supportive evidence that the ceramic femoral components are comparable with other implants and excellent functional outcomes ten years post-operatively. The ceramic femoral component in TKA is not commonly used in total hip arthroplasty."
31528342," OBJECTIVE Eating disorders ( EDs ) are serious problems among college-age women and may be preventable. An indicated online eating disorder ( ED ) intervention, design ed to reduce ED and comorbid pathology, was evaluated. METHOD 206 women ( M age = 20 ± 1.8 years ; 51 % White/Caucasian, 11 % African American, 10 % Hispanic, 21 % Asian/Asian American, 7 % other ) at very high risk for ED onset ( i.e., with high weight/shape concerns plus a history of being teased, current or lifetime depression, and /or non clinical levels of compensatory behaviors ) were r and omized to a 10-week, Internet-based, cognitive-behavioral intervention or waitlist control. Assessment s included the Eating Disorder Examination ( EDE, to assess ED onset ), EDE- Question naire, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders, and Beck Depression Inventory-II. RESULTS ED attitudes and behaviors improved more in the intervention than control group ( p =.02, d = 0.31 ) ; although ED onset rate was 27 % lower, this difference was not significant ( p=.28, NNT = 15 ). In the subgroup with highest shape concerns, ED outcome rate was significantly lower in those who received this intervention.. One patient population with a unique but poorly understood vulnerability to eating disorders, is people with bipolar disorder. The intervention was especially associated with lower remission rates if receiving medication only ( 10 % vs. 42 % for participants without overvaluation ). Overvaluation moderated dimensional outcomes : Participants with overvaluation had significantly greater reductions in eating disorder psychopathology and depression levels if receiving CBT.. The role of disordered eating in contributing to physical and mental health outcomes.. Bipolar disorder is a complex, serious mental illness that confers significant functional impairment, primarily due to time spent in manic, depressed, or mixed state episodes, the financial, social and emotional sequelae of illness episodes. One significant contributor to disability is physical ill health, with the average life expectancy of someone with BD disorder notably reduced due the physical health of this group, such as higher risk of depressive relapse [ 2, 3 ]. The past two decades has seen increased focus on preventing and improving the metabolic health of lean adolescent girls alone [ 1 ], whatever pop culture offerings such as Netflix ’s To The Bone might continue to present"
18986755," PURPOSE To assess the efficacy of sildenafil as treatment for erectile dysfunction ( ED )  in a clinical practice setting. In this study, we evaluated the role of intracavernosal alprostadil ( PGE1 ) or placebo nightly for 36 weeks, followed by an 8-week drug-free period before assessment of erectile function. In all, 40 men who had experienced unsatisfactory erections with both the 50 and 100 mg sildenafil doses were treated with four bi-weekly 20 μg IC-PGE1 injections given in the clinic and provided with either placebo or 50 mg sildenafil capsules for the next 4 weeks. RESULTS Of 22 patients, 18 started on sildenafil, and four started on low-dose Trimix ( 20 U ). Preoperative sexual function of all patients was evaluated by the International Index of Erectile Function-5 question naire. Of the 31 patients, 22 ( 71 % ) had a decrease in penile length ( p < 0.001 ). The size of the penis was significantly smaller after prostatectomy, and there was a significant difference for penile length between the 2 groups. The IIEF score was not significantly altered in patients with the same baseline characteristics. After a mean followup of 6 months ( 3–8 months ), 11/22 ( 50 % ) patients had return of spontaneous partial erections. The results of this pilot study appear to show that the basal severity of ED and etiological diagnosis are the prognostic factors most significantly associated with treatment outcome. In group 1, all but 1 patient reporting normal postoperative erections also showed normal erections at the first night after catheter removal. These results are significant for selecting adequate pharmacological treatment of ED in this population but also as a preventive strategy in penile rehabilitation programs. CONCLUSIONS To eluci date the pathophysiologic mechanisms of post-RP ED, to assess that penile erection and the potential of PDE5-Is for treating the corpora cavernosa. EVIDENCE-.A and  ."
21266418," The objective of this study was to determine whether vitamin D supplementation of breast-fed infants during the first year of life is associated with greater bone mineral content and /or areal bone mineral density ( aBMD ) in later childhood. The design was a retrospective cohort study. One hundred and six healthy prepubertal Caucasian girls ( median age, 8 yr ; range, 7 - 9 yr ) were enrolled and omly assigned to receive either 100, 200, or 400 IU of vitamin D a day. The study showed that season of birth and dose of Vitamin D supplementation did not affect the growth rate of infants born in the same latitude. The mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25(OH)D ) concentrations were higher ( 71.6 ± 19.9 and 52.4 ± 16.5 nmol/l ) than the winter ones. The majority of the girls ( n = 91 ) were eutrophic. The prevalence of rickets was lower than expected.. The average daily vitamin D levels were < or = 10 ng/mL in 16 subjects ( 31,42 ), and in 33% of girls.. In winter severe hypovitaminosis D ( S-25(OH)(D<20 nmol/L ) occurred in 13.4 % of  the participants and in 67.7 % S-vitamin D deficiency ( P = 0.01, 0.038, and 0.004, respectively ). In addition, hip BMD also showed a tendency to increase when 0.75 and 1.0 microg/day ED-71 groups were combined together in both upper and lower serum vitamin D status. The incidence of rickets and vitamin D deficiency was not significantly reduced by the intervention with vitamin D ( 10 μg/d ), but it decreased the incidence of osteomalacia.

29018544," STUDY DESIGN R and omized clinical trial. OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of attentional focus instructions during training on the transfer of a learned balance capability to a more challenging condition among subjects with ankle ligament injury. BACKGROUND Jumping and l and ing activities play a major role in many sports and daily activities. Feedback may assist individuals in decreasing the chances of sustaining an injury. METHODS AND MEASURES Nonimpaired college students ( N=63 ) were r and omly assigned to either an augmented or sensory feedback condition.. All subjects were asked to perform maximal vertical jumps onto a force plate for 3 testing sessions ( baseline, 2-minute post-test, and 1-week post-treatment ). The participants were also videotaped running on a treadmill at a st and ardized speed and performing a repeated tuck jump for 10 seconds. RESULTS There was a significant reduction in vGRF ( p=0.033 ), FPPA ( p<0.001 ) and an increase in contact time. Primary outcome measures were movement duration, peak velocity of the wrist, size of peak aperture and peak elbow extension. CONCLUSIONS Feedback inducing an EF of attention produced shorter movement duration s { first feedback order group : IF mean 2.53 seconds ( SD 1.85 ), S3 : −3.9 ± 1.3 Nm/kg ), these changes may result in decreased performance. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Verbal augmented feedback ( VAF ) is commonly used in physiotherapy rehabilitation of individuals with lower extremity musculoskeletal dysfunction or to induce motor learning for injury prevention. Its effectiveness for acquisition, retention and transfer in this population is unknown. Second, to determine its effect on motor learning and the stages of acquisition."
29326185," BACKGROUND : To assess the effectiveness of a disease management programme for patients with coronary heart disease ( MI ). The feasibility of a large-scale prospective randomized controlled trial to improve the adherence to evidence-based therapies. We sought to evaluate the impact of a multifaceted intervention that used a collaborative care model and was directed through primary care physicians and an oral glucose-tolerance test, was analysed. RESULTS Of 1465 patients who were screened, 402 took part in the intervention group ( 50 % previous myocardial infa rtion ). Physician extender visits were conducted according to a treatment algorithm based on contemporary practice guidelines. The primary outcome was the primary end point of achievement of low-density lipoprotein treatment goals at 3 months after discharge and achievement of additional evidence -based practice goals. Results : Overall composite performance was compared between cohorts at the end of study and the control group. Although we observed a similar proportion of patients who completed the study ( the local opinion leader ), they had similar baseline performance ( median score 83.7 % vs 84.2 % ).. The secondary end point was a composite score of the 7 clinical indicators, and their respective treatment.. Of the 219 patients, 66 % had at least one risk factor ( LDL or blood pressure above target levels or current smoking ). We found that the majority of patients ( 92 % ) had the following outcomes. Patients in intervention clinics had greater improvements ( from 70.0 % to 85.5 % ) than patients in control clinics ( 71 % vs. 79 %, p <.001.. We determined whether interventions targeted at healthcare professionals are effective to enhance prescribing and health outcomes in patients with IHDs.

31080644," Background This study aims to investigate the influence of the application of enhanced recovery after surgery ( ERAS ). We frequently apply the Modified-ERAS program following esophagectomy. We investigated the impact of a program of gastrointestinal rehabilitation and early postoperative enteral nutrition upon complications and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing esophagectomy. Methods The ERAS program was initiated in 2009. Patients who underwent esophagectomy and were treated according to the ERAS program were included. Items of ERAS included preoperative nutrition, early extubation, early removal of nasogastric tube, and early mobilization. Primary outcome parameters were hospital stay and the incidence of postoperative complications.. The variables recorded for each patient included the first day of gas passage, defecation and bowel sounds ( BSs ), postoperative morbidity, length of stay ( LOS ), and C-reactive protein ( CRP ). The feasibility analysis was performed among a sample of ERAS patients to determine the number of achieved items per patient. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy, risks, quality of life and cost-effectiveness of RATE as an alternative to open transthoracic esophagectomy for treatment of esophageal cancer. RESULTS The proportion of patients who completely egested Gastrografin by postoperative day 4, the level of postoperative mobilisation, and achievement ratio for a 100-m walk ( P = 0.01 ). There were no significant differences in the postoperative complication ( 15.5 % vs 21.2 % ), nor the length of hospital stay. The percentage of patients with this protocol was similar between the two groups. The postoperative recovery was significantly lower than the control group. The hospital stay was shorter ( p < 0.001 ), 30-day postoperative morbidity ( OR 0.78 ).. We believe that Fast track is a fast track protocol s used in oesophagectomy  since its implementation, thus decreasing the cost associated with postoperative recovery. The full track system and.)."
27124041," BACKGROUND : The effectiveness of bariatric surgery for type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) has been proposed as an effective alternative to the current st and ard procedure. This report describes 1-year changes in CVD risk factors in a trial design. The aim of this study was to compare the long-term effects of RYGB compared with the usual lifestyle intervention on the incidence of major CVD events. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : This study consisted of a multicentered, r and omized trial at 4 teaching hospitals in the United States and Taiwan. The primary end point was a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.0 % or less. We evaluated food intake and nutrient adequacy ( T0, T3, T12 ), as well as serum vitamin and mineral concentration. Twenty-seven subjects, primarily premenopausal women, representing 8.5 % of the cohort and 22 % of patients the weight and BMI, and an intensive lifestyle weight loss intervention ( LWLI ). A total of 91 % of participants were receiving antihyperglycemic medications. The 2 groups were similar in terms of body mass index, age, sex, comorbidities, and eating behavior. At 3 years, the ratio of obese patients was lower in RYGB than for LRYGB.. The mean weight loss was lower and the proportion of diabetics than the medical-therapy group. The LSG group had lower risk-adjusted morbidity, readmission and reoperation/intervention rates compared to both groups. The RYGB group had higher mean percentage reductions in weight from baseline than did the LAGB group. 2- and 10-year incidence rates of T1DM, 7.8 % ( 1.9 % ) and 3.3 %.

We studied prospect ively and consecutively an unselected and community‐based sample of 881 patients with acute stroke.. We performed a multicenter, r and omized, double-blind trial to test whether piracetam twice daily, or placebo.. The testing data base comprises h and search ing data from 161 clinical journals.. Thirty-two patients received piraceetam as an initial intravenous bolus, 12 patients daily for 4 weeks and 4.8 g daily for 8 weeks. The primary end point was neurologic outcome after 4 weeks.. Aphasia was diagnosed in 34 % of the patients during the acute phase, and two thirds of them remained so 12 months later... There was a significant improvement in the language tasks ( Gray Oral Reading Test ) and reading comprehension ( Purdue Pegboard Test ). The difference between the treated group was statistically not different or better than the single term ( 97.6 % ).. Objective We demonstrated that the improvement of language performance was a common symptom in post-stroke patients. The non-verbal neuropsychological test performance was the only clinical measure to be significantly improved in patients with cerebral palsy, including language improvement."
15674903," BACKGROUND Few primary care physicians routinely counsel for exercise, despite the benefits of physical activity to the transition of adults to adulthood. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of a mailed stage-targeted print intervention design ed to promote physical activity among adults aged 40 to 64 years. The intervention group received health screening, a brief intervention, and, 2 weeks later, a booster telephone call from a nurse practitioner. Participants were assessed regarding current physical activity behavior, motivational readiness to adopt regular physical activity, and psychological constructs associated with physical activity participation ( e.g. self-efficacy, decisional balance ). RESULTS The main outcome measures of interest included weight ( controls, + 1.0 kg vs. treatment, -2.2 kg, p < 0.05 ), and various chronic diseases and conditions. At the 6-month follow-up, the intervention group were significantly more likely to have progressed in stage of motivational readiness for physical activity.. There was no significant impact on physical activity levels at the 12 months. The results indicated a short-term motivational effect from being informed of CHFT results... The effects of interventions for promoting physical activity were observed ( F 1,719 = 2.18, p =.14 ).

28836492," BACKGROUND Epidemiological evidence supports that a diet high in whole grains is associated with lowered risk of chronic diseases included coronary heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer. We showed previously that consumption of the heat-treated food by omnivores could be reflected by higher plasma levels of advanced glycation end products ( AGEs ) in comparison with vegetarians, who in cooking ( by keeping away from meat ) use lower temperatures and less time for heating. Research design and methods A r and omized, controlled, crossover trial was conducted in 45 subjects with T2D ( n=74 ) with a fixed amount of selected WG wheat or RW products for 8 wk. At baseline and every 4 wk, blood, urine, feces, and serum levels of adiponectin. The faecal flora from patients with HI and LI differed significantly from each other at 1 and 13 months during the diet. This finding of an association between intestinal flora and disease activity may have implication s for our underst and ing of how diet can affect RA. RESULTS The whole grain diet was significantly higher in dietary fiber, vitamin B6, folate, selenium, copper, zinc, iron, magnesium and cystine. Similarly, urinary FA at 8 wk doubled the baseline concentration only in WG subjects. Concomitant reduction in plasma tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) after 8 wk and increased interleukin (IL)-10 only after 4 wk with WG compared with RW ( P = 0.04 ). In conclusion, consumption of fatty fish  decreased the levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, plasleukin-6, and pulse wave velocity.

26118568," Background The tissue sparing surgery ( DAA ) is generally accepted method for minimal invasive arthroplasty of the hip. As good results for total hip arthroplasty are already published, there is a lack of evidence for the implantation of bipolar hip hemiarthroplasty ( BHH ) in elderly patients with osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to compare the learning curve of an experienced surgeon with different TSS approaches for hip fracture. The primary end point was the postoperative recovery of hip function after primary THA , ( 2 ) general health outcomes, ( 3 ) operative time and surgical complications, and ( 4 ) accuracy of component placement. Material s and methods Sixty patients scheduled to be operated for a primary THR were enrolled in the study and were retrospectively review ed to evaluate the early complication rate and radiographic accuracy of implant placement. The same outcome measures were analyzed for significant differences between patients with or without complications in each group. Results The Smith-Petersen approach yielded a statistically significant increase in postoperative pain within the first 4 days and an increase in operation time. Complications were documented and followed up 1 year postoperatively. The Harris Hip Score ( HHS ), the Trendelenburg sign, and 1 loose stem ( minimally invasive ). The effectiveness of MIS-BHA for femoral neck fracture is limited to the initial postoperative period. Therefore, we think that the less invasive direct lateral approach may not provide an advantage over the traditional approach"
25236305," BACKGROUND To determine the efficacy of a 3-month clinic-based behavioral nutrition intervention emphasizing a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and low fat dairy (. ). The study was a 12-week, r and omized, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled study. After a single-blind placebo run-in period ( 4 weeks ), patients with mean sitting systolic blood pressure ( BP ) ( 25 mg twice daily ), or diastolic BP.. The primary end point was change in seated systolic BP ( SBP ) from baseline to study end.. Each treatment arm was 30 days. No significant differences were observed in mean systolic ( DBP ) and diastolic blood pressure, or between placebo and the other calcium channel blockers. Using 24-h blood pressure monitoring there were no significant differences in SBP, diastolic BP, or both. The combined primary endpoint was fatal and non-fatal stroke, myocardial infa rct ion, and other cardiovascular death. Analysis was done by intention to treat. The mean age was 12.85 years and follow-up was 2.42 years (. The prevalence of hypertension in children is rising, most likely due to a concurrent rise in obesity rates. In children with hypertension, non-pharmacological measures are often recommended as first-line therapy, but a significant proportion of children will eventually require pharmacological treatment to reduce blood pressure. The overall incidence of hypertension, especially those with evidence of end organ damage, was not statistically lower than placebo. In contrast, in children the proportion of patients with hypertension was significantly higher than in adults. There is a paucity of data on the effects of antihypertensive agents in children, but it is known that children with obesity, as monotherapy compared to placebo, on systolic or diastolic arterial pressure, and on kidney damage. The dose-related effects of drugs in children are unclear, as well as the role of placebo and/or a single medication, in children with severe hypertension."
17943736," The aim of the clinical trial was to investigate the effects of a daily dosage of 3 g n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) on peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ). The study was designed as a double blind placebo controlled trial of high-density lipoprotein ( LDL)-raising treatment and placebo in patients with peripheral vascular disease. The primary end-point was the incidence of coronary heart disease ( CHD ).. The secondary end-points were the following:. The trial. : Patients with coronary artery disease were treated with placebo, two types of lipid-lowering therapy, which is double-blind and placebo-controlled, and one in the beta-fibrinogen ( FIBB ). There was no significant difference between the two groups. The incidence of diabetes ( n=158 ) was associated with 15 % higher triglyceride levels at baseline compared to non-diabetics ( n =654 ) ( P<0.05 ).. The pain-free walking distance increased on average ( + /- SEM ) by 83.2 % and low-density lipo-cholesterol by approximately 9.0 %. The change in lumen volume correlated significantly with change in HDL, ie, HDL cholesterol ( r =.34, P <.01 ) and HDL-C in type IV hyperlipoproteinemics. The principal comparisons were to be of those allocated simvastatin ( i.e. 20 and 40 mg doses combined ) and placebo. The combined treatment group showed a significant reduction of all-cause mortality ( p = 0.02 ). It may also reduce cardiovascular events and /or local disease progression in people with PAD. The results indicate that SLP treatment alone may not reduce CV events in those with PAD and the lower limb peripheral artery disease...

26027632," OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of a structured exercise program on functional capacity and quality of life in patients with intermittent claudication ( IC ). OBJECTIVE Secondary data analyses using distribution- and anchor-based methods to determine meaningful change. RESULTS Over a 6-year period, 178 patients ( 108 men ; median age, 70 years ) with PAD.. We r and omized to a supervised exercise , 33 completed  supervised exercise, and 30 completed usual-care control. Patients were assessed prior to and at 1 and 3 months post treatment.. The exercise program consisted of intermittent walking to nearly maximal walking distances. Primary outcome measures included the 6-minute walk, walking velocity over four meters at usual and fastest pace, and the short physical performance battery ( SPPB ) ( 0 - 12 scale, 12 = best ). The institution-based rehabilitation program was compared with the control group... Adherence to home-based and supervised exercise was similar ( P=0.712 ) and exceeded 80 %. Both exercise programs increased the mean walking distance ( P < 0.001 ) and peak walking time ( P<0.01 ). At baseline, the hospital-based program was treated with treadmill walking three times a week for one hour/visit. In treated subjects, maximal calf blood flow ( measured by a plethysmograph ) increased 38 + /- 45 % ( p less than 0.05 ), while the supervised exercise group had a significantly better 43 % improvement in base line score ( P = 0.03 ). We assessed the effectiveness of the exercise program. The mean relative improvement compared with baseline was statistically significant after 12 months of exercise, but its use is limited by cost. Unsupervised exercise ( UE ) is widely accepted as an effective therapy for peripheral arterial disease.. Although a supervised program results in optimal walking performance, a highly supervised exercise program may be considered as a less costly alternative for patients with IC."
28294172," BACKGROUND Vitamin C ( ASA ) and vitamins C and E may inhibit the development of diabetes mellitus, but the evidence is limited and inconclusive. Plasma vitamin C level is a good biomarker of insulin resistance. In the present study, we investigated the effect of oral vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene on glycemic control in diabetic patients. : In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test the efficacy of vitamin C on circulating biomarkers of glycaemic and insulin regulation. RESULTS : Subjects were randomized to receive either vitamin C ( r and omized ) or placebo... The study participants were divided into two groups.. : The baseline and after 1 month of lifestyle and diet modifications, groups A, B, and C were prescribed 1000 mg Vitamin C, 600 mg gemfibrozil and combination of both, respectively.. Before the study initiation and after 6th week of drug prescription, the blood sample s were taken and analyzed for total cholesterol ( Total-C ), HDL-C, TG, fasting blood sugar ( FBS ), and hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ).. After a median follow-up of 9.2 y, a total of 895 incident cases occurred among 6574 women who were free of diabetes at baseline.. There was a trend toward a modest reduction in diabetes risk in the placebo group ( 25.8 % ) and high ( 34.6±20.4 to 73.8±23.3 ). Vitamin C supplementation significantly increased the incidence of diabetes, but not the prevalence of diabetes.. In a trial of the vitamin C treatment, the odds ratio of diabetes in patients with a low BMI compared with the control group was 1.13 ( p=0.017 ). The vitamin C and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) have observed contrasting results on the effects of oral supplementation and-.)."
31095078," Purpose This study sought to determine if a 12-week intermittent ( INT ; 2 3 15 min·d−1 ) exercise program yielded similar improvements in cardiovascular health and fitness in overweight adult females and to compare the programs ’ relative effects on oxidative stress. Methods : R and om sample from the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ). Participants. A total of 4511 adults aged 18 to 64 years old ( LB, n = 28, age = 40.9 + /- 7.3 yrs ). Clinical ly measured body mass index ( BMI ) and the percentage of body fat ( fat% ). Following measurement of  resting energy expenditure ( REE ), subjects were asked to follow a self-monitored calorie restricted diet ( 80 % of REE ) for an additional 12 weeks of training. Subjects exercised incrementally for weeks 1–4 and training was conducted at 70–80 % heart rate reserve for weeks 5–24. Both groups showed comparable exercise adherence, completing 96.6 ± 12.2 % ( CON ) and 96.3 % ± 17.7 % ( INT ) of the prescribed exercise time. The INT walked at a lower percentage of & OV0312;O2max, maximum heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure ( p < 0.05 ). The interaction between ethnicity and MVPA in predicting percent body fat was significant ( P=0.01, 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) ( 0.58, 4.43 ).. Moderate to long exercise episodes of < 10 min in duration have health-related benefits or, alternatively, if the benefits are only realized when the duration of physical activity episodes is ≥10 min."
21127200," OBJECTIVES To determine the effectiveness of an active ergonomics training ( AET ) program on the occurrence of upper limb disorders among computer users. The study included clinical and epidemiological studies, measurement of the vibration produced by the power tools used, to quantify workplace factors associated with the onset of forearm pain. Methods : A r and omized controlled intervention trial was conducted with 86 participants. Baseline WRF predicted successful WRF at 2 months, whereas being depressed and a workers'compensation cl aim ant predicted being out of work. The intervention consisted of psychological and physical sessions provided by a medical specialist, a psychologist, a physiotherapist and an occupational therapist. RESULTS Among 6,038 first-stage responders, 3,152 reported upper limb symptoms and 1,960 were subsequently examined. Of subjects with pain, 44.8 % had 1 or more specific soft-tissue disorders. The overall outcome variable was the severity of complaints. The majority of subjects in the intervention groups had a reduction in pain ( 55 % versus 34 % ). The group that received the alternative mouse had a protective, but non-significant ( p = 0.20 ), effect on incident cases of right upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders ( HR 0.57, 95 % CI 0.24 to 1.34 ), the majority of workers. The between observer repeatability of physical signs varied from good to excellent, with κ coefficients of 0.66 - 1.00 for most categorical observations, and mean absolute differences of 1.4 ° –11.9 ° for measurements of shoulder movement. The sensitivity of these findings in terms of return-to-work, and other somatic symptoms are important predictors of outcome of work-aged adults with upper limb pain."
26972954," OBJECTIVE To determine whether the effectiveness of a single education and self management structured programme for diabetes mellitus  in a primary care setting can be safely transferred to practice nurses. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We used a group-based randomized controlled trial, with general practice s as the unit of r and omisation. Setting General practice s in the United Kingdom. Participants 59 of 69 primary care practice s that agreed to participate recruited sufficient patients and were r or omized. The patients in this study were randomized to either intervention group or control group. Clinical, biochemical, and medication-related data were collected on 604 ( 82.6 % ) and 6 months. The main outcome measure was change in HbA(1c ). A diabetes-specific risk engine was used to estimate changes in glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ), total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. RESULTS A total of 180 patients ( 91 % ) completed the study.  Mean ( 95 % CI ) reductions were greater in intervention patients than for comparison patients ( median values ) : fasting plasma glucose concentration ( 7.9 v 8.7 mmol/l, P=0.002 ; systolic and diastolic blood pressure, P = 0.001 ). The intervention did not improve A1C ( P =0.54 ), LDL ( P= 0.46 ), or treatment adherence. In the intervention group, the patients were increasingly freed from the feeling of being under the control of physician and treatment-related restrictions, which -- together with higher perceived self-efficacy, contributed to the improvement in HbA1C... The study showed that the interventions targeting primary care or community based professionals on glycaemic and cardiovascular risk factor control in people with diabetes."
17010257," The effect of oral iron supplementation on growth in children aged 1 - 8 y was assessed in a double-masked, placebo-controlled field trial. The children were classified into anemic and normal groups according to their initial hemoglobin and transferrin saturation levels and were r and omly assigned to either iron or placebo treatment for 12 wk. In the baseline before intervention the groups did not differ significantly in age, sex ratio, prevalence and intensity of intestinal helminthic infections, most anthropometric measurements or hemoglobin levels.. A baseline appetite test was conducted twice on each child by quantitatively measuring the ad libitum consumption of a midmorning snack. A complete data set was analysed for 140 subjects. The mean hemoglobin concentration was not significantly different between the daily ( mean + /- SD ; 6.5 + / - 6.0 g/L ) and placebo groups. The height increments were significantly lower in the iron supplementation group ( P < 0.001 ) than that of infants fed formula fortified with 6 mg/L.. The same effect on length was seen in infants with anemia ( 20 % vs. 38 % ) and in those with normal hemoglobin ( Hb ). There were no differences among the other groups in growth. The growth of all children was insufficient to maintain the same Z-scores for height for age and weight for height."
27273067," BACKGROUND Barley has high amounts of soluble fiber but is not extensively consumed in the US diet. This study investigated whether consumption of barley would reduce the visceral fat area as well as the serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ).. The purpose of the study was to compare the effects of two sources of dietary fiber ( nonstarch polysaccharides, NSP ) on blood lipids and glucose concentrations. RESULTS Mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects ( 9 postmenopausal women, 9 premenopausal women, and 7 men ) consumed controlled American Heart Association Step 1 diets for 17 wk. After this adaptation period, subjects were r and omly assigned to groups consuming either rice ( placebo group ) or a mixture of rice and pearl barley with a high beta-glucan content ( test group ). Fasting blood sample s were collected twice weekly.. Blood sample s was collected on days 0, 21, 49, 70 and 98 in both study arms. Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol ( C ), and triacylglycerols were measured enzymatically and lipid fractions were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results : Compared with the carbohydrate diet, the protein diet further decreased mean systolic blood pressure by 1.4 mm Hg ( P = 0.002 ) and by 3.5 mm Hg, and intermediate VLDL fractions were significantly lower ( p < 0.0001 ) after the 3 g/d groups. There were no differences among the treatments in terms of LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol, apo A-I, and glucose. During the intervention diet periods, a difference was found between treatment groups for the mean change in LDL ( 0.21 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.02–0.40 ), non-HDL-C, and apolipoprotein B ( apoB ). The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis of barley as a therapeutic food owing to its high content of β-glucan ( β-glucosidase ), a viscous soluble fibre, and low-dose-.).. The study was not significantly affected by the placebo group."

The Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension ( STOP-Hypertension ) was a prospect i ve, double-blind trial in 2334 patients with hypertension that compared the effects of a 4-year treatment based on either metoprolol or a non-calcium antagonist strategy ( NCAS ). The ADaPT investigation ( "" ACE inhibitor-based versus diuretic-based antihypertensive treatment in patients with heart failure. The IMPACT-HF was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial conducted in 1094 patients aged 18 to 70 years with hypertensive renal disease.. Patients were r and omized to carvedilol initiation pre-hospital discharge or to postdischarge initiation ( > 2 weeks ) of beta-blockade. The primary endpoint was the number of patients treated with a treatment difference in mean arterial blood pressure ( goal MAP ) of either 102 - 107 mm Hg or < or = 92 mm Hg. The study was stopped after a median follow-up of 3.3 years. By that time, there were some studies with a high risk ( p=0.039 ) or atenolol ( p = 0.034 ). A primary endpoint occurred in 403 patients in the diltiazem group and in 400 in those on placebo. The mean difference in BP control between the active treatment and placebo groups was identical with both treatments, but 24-hour ambulatory systolic/diastolic blood pressure changes were greater with atenolol ( 95 % CI 0.58 - 1.15 ). Beta‐blockers were thought to have similar beneficial effects on mortality and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) when used as first‐line therapy for hypertension. The benefit of beta‐blockers as first‑line treatment for hypertension is unclear. and,. . The risk of mortality and morbidity in adults with hypertension is similar to that -/"
25164349," The techniques of endoscopic sphincterotomy ( LC ) were used to evaluate the treatment of gallstone disease. The most part of the patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy , the reason for having the gallbladder removed may rest on common practice rather than evidence -based medicine. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical effectiveness of treatment with observation ( watchful waiting ). The patients with gallbladder disease between August 2001 and July 2004 completed preoperative and postoperative GI gallbladder symptom surveys ( GISS )  and  SF36 QOL surveys. The overall prevalence of gallbladder disease ( cases with stones ) and choleystectomy ( 0.71, 0.91 ) and answered question naires on pain, quality of life ( PGWB index and NHP Part II ). Sixteen patients were enrolled for the examination programme. The mean difference in health status at inclusion and after follow-up was calculated for patients without gallstones, for patients with gallstones who were operated on and for patients who were not operated on. RESULTS : Of patients r and omized to observation, 35 of 69 patients ( 51 % ) had pain, but they also show that nearly one half of operated patients were dissatisfied with the procedure. The incidence of chronic pain patients was higher in the group of patients with intense acute postoperative pain than in patients with low acute pain ( p = 0.030 ).. The results suggest that there was a low rate and severity of common bile duct injuries, with a high intraoperative recognition rate.

25865603," Objective : To determine the validity and reliability of the  total neuropathy score ( TNS ) in patients with chronic neuropathic pain. In 40 CMT patients, we assessed reliability of Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale ( ONLS ), 10-m timed walk ( T10MW ), 9-hole-peg test ( 9-HPT ), and the relation between sensory loss, intrinsic muscle strength, and h and dexterity was explored in 45 patients.. The internal consistency of all three question naires was very high, the authors used the TNS as the outcome measure. The TNS was related to both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness,  quality of life ( QoL ), to items assessing sharp and deep pain than for items assessing cold, sensitive, and itchy pain. The results showed that the PGI-I category of "" much better "" or above was our a priori definition of a CID. For both, TR‐R and IO‐R, there were high correlations ( r = 0.80–0.93 ) at the affected test area. The changes in the PI‐NRS from baseline to the endpoint were similar for all subjects. The opioid analgesic did not significantly reduce pain intensity, but rather increased the pain severity. The psychometric properties of a particular measure should demonstrate appropriate method ological quality. This research should be used to evaluate change following an intervention in clinical trials on chronic neuropathy. The outcomes of interest are the domains of pain and physical functioning, for which individual properties ( eg, reliability/validity ) have been reported."

Seventy patients classified with AS by the modified New York criteria were included. The patients were r and omly assigned into 2 groups. The intervention group ( IG ) performed 50 min of walking followed by stretching exercises 3 times a week for 12 weeks. The control group ( CG ) performed only stretching exercises. The outcome measurements were the Bath indexes [ Bath AS Functional Index ( BASFI ), Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI ), and Bath AS Metrology Index ( ASMI ) ], Health Assessment Question naire for the Spondyloarthropathies ( HAQ-S ), AS Disease activity Score ( ASDAS ), the 6-min walk test ( 6MWT ), chest expansion, and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36. Aerobic capacity was assessed by ergospirometry on a treadmill. Routine laboratory techniques were used in determining lipid levels. Results. The ASDAS scores outperformed the BASDAI and its single components in all setting s : patient- or physician-based, reflecting status or change, with normal or raised C-reactive protein ( CRP ), in the presence or absence of peripheral arthritis. There were no major differences between the four ASAS scores. The progression of radiological joint damage was not increased by exercise to the ankle joint. A mean treatment effect of −0.7 ( 95%CI : −1.4, 0.1 ) was seen in ASDAS score. The IG showed significant improvement in cardiopulmonary capacity compared with CG. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels did not change in either group. Conclusion To evaluate the impact of an aerobic fitness program on disease activity, defined by using the Birmingham Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score ( BASDAI ) and on C- reactive protein ( ESR ), erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( BAS FI ),.."

We sought to compare the effects of catheter ablation for AF on the outcomes of patients with LV systolic dysfunction. The authors evaluated patients with AF and symptomatic LV dysfunction ( LA ), who underwent catheter ablation ( CA ).  Patients with persistent AF, symptomatic HF, and LV ejection fraction < 50 % were r and omized to catheter ablation or medical rate control.  All patients underwent the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure question naire ( LVHF ), and they comprised the study group. The patients were followed for 1 month, 3 months, 6-, 9-, and 12-month intervals. RESULTS After a mean follow-up of 14+/-2 months, the LVEF was achieved in 21/26 ( 81 % ), compared with 54 % in controls.. The LV systolic function was significantly improved in the ablation group ( 55.6 ± 6.2 vs. 52.4 ± 5.5, P=0.03 ). At 12 months, 88 % of ablation patients maintained sinus rhythm ( single-procedure success 68 % ). The cohort had significant improvement in left ventricular function ( 2.9 ± 0.3 to 12.9±11.8 cm2, P<0.001 )...

We compared the effects of diltiazem with that of diuretics, beta-blockers, or both on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The combined results demonstrate positive, continuous, and apparently independent associations, with no significant heterogeneity of effect among different studies.. Within the range of DBP studied ( about 70 - 110 mm Hg ), there was no evidence of any "" threshold "" below which lower levels of BP were not associated with lower risks of stroke and of CHD. Of the participants, the majority ( 85 % ) were not receiving beta blockers, and the remainder were. The incidence of fatal and non-fatal stroke, myocardial infa rct ion, and other serious adverse events. The mean age was 72 years, 57 % were women, and 14 % were black. The study is being conducted in 172 centres in 10 countries ( Australia, Belgium, China, France, Italy, Irel and, Japan, New Zeal and, Sweden.. We assessed the effectiveness of lowering blood pressure in preventing recurrent vascular events in patients with previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. The results emphasize that although the incidence of stroke was low, the benefit was not observed in this study of seven years.. The overall mortality was low. High blood pressure is a risk factor for stroke. The treatment of hypertension and to lower blood pressure may have reduced the risk of stroke in patients over the age of 60..

28264715," BACKGROUND Clinical studies have shown that biphasic shocks are more effective than monophasic shocks for atrial fibrillation. We evaluated prospect ively the relation between type and duration of atrial tachyarrhythmias and the probability of successful cardioversion. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship of digoxin use to mortality in patients with permanent atrial flutter. The study was conducted using the three dimensions of systematic error, r and om error, and design error.. We analyzed 453 consecutive patients undergoing their first transthoracic electrical cardioversion ( AF ) and 95 attempts for atrial flutter ( AS ). Patients in the ablation group underwent further r or omization to pulmonary-vein isolation or a biatrial maze procedure. The reference group consisted of 168 678 subjects who did not receive any rate-control drug. The clinical end point was all-cause mortality. During a follow-up of 4.9±3.7 years, 167 patients ( 17.7 % ) and 372 ( 39.7 percent ) were treated with digoxin. In univariate Cox analyses, in-treatment digoxin use was associated with a higher rate of death from arrhythmia than the patients assigned to placebo. In patients with AFL/AT, the lowest total cumulative energy was attained with an initial energy setting of 50 J, and this was similar to those with AF.. The incidence of atrial flutter, at a maximum of 200 J, was higher than with AF, and atrial flutter had an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.12 ( 95 % confidence interval=1.10 - 1.14 ). The results were observed consistently in subgroup analyses and among the USA. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmmia with an incidence of approximately 200,000 new patients per year. Atrial flutter is often based on interventions aim ing at either a rhythm control strategy or a rate control strategy. The evidence on the comparable effects of these strategies is unclear."

The study was designed to assess the efficacy of a technology-based heart failure monitoring system, we compared the outcomes of a r and omized controlled trial that was supported by the Department of Veterans'Affairs ( DVA ). Of 490 patients who were recruited, 409 were surveyed at baseline ( 214 in the intervention group and 195 controls ). At follow-up, 288 were surveyed ( 155 intervention and 133 controls ),. Information on cost of care and quality of life ( QOL ) was collected before the commencement of intervention. The primary outcome was mortality and rate of hospitalizations ( P = 0.006 ), and secondary outcomes were: QOL, titration to maximum tolerated dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and the mean telephone contact. Comparative outcomes were assessed using relative risk ( RR ), relative risk reduction, and Cox proportional hazards model for adjusting by potential confounders. RESULTS The rate of death or hospitalization for HF was reduced ( hazard ratio, 0.64, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 0.43 to 0.88 ; P=0.008 ), while the rate of rehospitalization. The quality -of-life question naire score improved only in those patients with HF.

30283040," BACKGROUND Postoperative abdominal adhesions are one of the major factors which significantly and adversely affect surgery outcome due to intra- and postoperative morbidity and reduce future female fertility. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of aspirin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, in the prevention of adhesion formation. The rats were r and omized into four groups after seven st and ardized primary traumatic lesion to the right uterine horn. After surgery, the rats were divided into three groups : control, chitosan and simvastatin group. After laminectomy was performed at L1 level, atorvastatin 30 mg/kg/day, p.o. ( 10 rats ), and the control group received no additional treatment. At the day 21, animals were euthanized and then the postoperative adhesion was evaluated by macroscopic assessment, hydroxyproline content analysis and histological analysis. The number of autophagosomes and tissue plasminogen activator total antigen ( P < 0.05 ), increased TF and PAI-1 mRNA expression in glomerular mesangial cells and plasma activities. The lowest adhesion score was found in those treated with simvastatin. The hydroxypro- tion of aspirin was significantly improved compared to PG. While only five ( 6 percent ) of 90 control patients had significant differences in HSS and VAS pain at each time point compared with baseline for TG. The decrease in early postoperative RHI relative to preoperative RHI was significantly associated with adverse cardiovascular events  after surgery. Of them, 46 patients ( 48 % ) had first- grade adhesion, while in control group, 11 rats ( 68.8 % ) were found to have abdominal adhesion. Many research ers studied the anti-adhesive effect of statin, of which results were inconsistent. Thus, we purpose d to perform a systematic review and meta- analysis to determine the effect of atorvastatin on postoperative adhesion.). and."

28899233," Background. Preference-based measures of health-related quality of life all use the same dead = 0.00 to perfect health = 1.00 scale, but there are substantial differences among measures. Objective. The objective was to examine agreement in classifying patients as better, stable, or worse. Methods. The EQ-5D, Health Utilities Index Mark 2 and Mark 3, Quality of Well-Being – Self-Administered scale, Short-Form 36 ( Short-form 6D ), and disease-targeted measures were administered prospect ively in 2 clinical cohorts. The study was conducted at academic medical centers : University of California, Los Angeles ; University of Southern California, San Diego ; and University of Wisconsin – Madison ; and Northwestern University. The SF-12 summary scores were calculated for 1,380 respondents. The respondents assessed the patient's health state using 4 measures : rating scale ( RS ), time tradeoff ( TTO ), st and ard gamble ( SG ). In both cohorts, subjects completed surveys at baseline and at 1 and 6 months. The NEI-VFQ-25 and MLHF were used as gold st and ards to assign patients to categories of change. Agreement was assessed using κ. Also, to determine the efficacy of the technique we compared the perceived state of health ( measured by the EQ5D ) to PD patients respect to those reported with conservative therapies. Results Eighty-one residents ( 89.0 % of eligible ) participated. Complete data for baseline and the 6-month follow-up were available for these two options. The preference scaling system in generic utility-based quality of health measures provides a metric that is directly interpretable and avoids many of  the criticisms of MCID measures. The method is sensitive enough to suggest clinical utility values for health domains and scores for CVD."
26442959," OBJECTIVE To determine whether an internet-based diabetes management program can improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A treatment network consisting of a diabetes specialist and four general practitioners was established. The study was to evaluate the impact of using a nurse-led diabetes care program ( Comprehensive Diabetes Management Program, CDMP ) for poorly controlled diabetes patients. The control group ( n = 50 ) or control ( glucometer transmission without feedback ) groups were recruited to the study. Participants were r and omized to either Diabetes TeleCare, a 12-month, 13-session curriculum delivered using telehealth strategies, or usual care. The primary outcomes were changes in patient-reported diabetes symptoms, blood pressure, foot exam, and other clinical ( blood pressure ) and laboratory ( lipid ) values. RESULTS Of 130 patients ( aged 35.7 ± 9.4 years ; diabetes duration 16.5 ± 10.5 years ), 11 dropped out.  Time for education was 6 h ( range 2–15 h ) in group A and 12 h ( 2.5 % ) in the non-DialBetics control group. The proportion of patients meeting clinical goals at follow-up tended to be higher than AC for A1c ( IC = 45 % ; AC = 28 % ). The mean declines in glycated hemoglobin were also significantly ( 12.6 + /- 6.1 % vs. 5.7 % ), the difference was not statistically significant. The intervention group had higher overall scores on quality of life measures and treatment satisfaction. However, the intervention showed no significant difference in HbA1c, type of diabetes mellitus, or blood pressure and lipid levels ( all P > 0.05 ). CONCLUSIONS A teleassistance system using real-time transmission of the telemedicine program has a significant impact on diabetes outcomes or what kind of nutritional counseling is most effective."

Participants were aged 3 - 5 years and attended centre-based childcare. The time spent in MVPA , measured with accelerometers, at the child care center and over the 24-hour day among 388 preschoolers in the intervention group. The RECESS group received two additional 30-minute periods of outdoor free play time per day for two days. The CON group followed their normal classroom schedule. Between group differences in physical activity variables were tested with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences between groups in changes from baseline in average total daily ( CON, 48.2 ± 114.5 ; RECESS, 58.2+/-74.6 ) and during school day (.. The study demonstrates that a physical activity program implemented by staff within a preschool setting is feasible, acceptable and potentially efficacious. The positive association with size of indoor area per child and location of the preschool building on the playground seem important correlates to be targeted in future studies. The majority of preschoolers spend a substantial portion of their day enrolled in centre based childcare ; the amounts of physical activity and sedentary time accumulated in this environment are critical to preschoolers ’ ability to meet movement guidelines. The purpose of this systematic review was to provide a comprehensive overview of  the objective ly assessed physical activity  and  sedentary times  of preschoolers in centre- based childcare."

30872787," Objective : To determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25(OH)D ) levels and renal function in healthy children. We evaluated whether supplementation with vitamin D could improve serum vitamin D status and bone turnover. Methods In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 76 healthy participants were enrolled and omized to receive either vitamin D3 ( 600 mg ) or placebo ( n = 32 ), then their infants, from birth to age 6 months. The participants were r and omly assigned to 1 of 3 intervention groups : vitamin D + placebo, vitamin D( 600 IU ), or vitamin D₃ + placebo. The mean ( SD ) serum 25( OH)D at baseline was 31.6 ( 8.7 ) nmol/L, and the dose – response relationship was curvilinear with a plateau around 6 weeks. Serum calcium, 25-OH-vitamin D, and vitamin D metabolites, serum calcium and parathyroid hormone concentrations were measured at baseline and post intervention. At baseline, the proportions with serum 25[OH]D ≥20 ng/mL for placebo, lower-dose, and higher-dose groups were 54 %, 64 %, and 55 %, respectively. The number of days with 25(OHD)D ≥ 20 ng/L was significantly higher in the vitamin D group ( median 46·5 ; IQR 14·8 - 73·3 ). The frequency of calcitriol supplementation was higher in group 3 ( median 18·5 ( s.d. 24.5 ) ). There was no significant change in serum 25OHD levels ( p<0.001 ). Conclusion : Daily vitamin D is needed to achieve an optimal vitamin D concentration for different population s.

From among 20 000 women selected at r and om on the telephone survey of facial pain, 2000 were invited for an RDC /TMD examination ; 782 examinations were completed.. Prevalence was estimated in analyses that were weighted to correct sampling biases. Differences among demographic strata were evaluated with logistic regression. The prevalence of M-TMD was estimated to be 10.5 % ( 95 % CL = 8.5 - 13.0 % ). Three examiners, with varying levels of experience in diagnosing TMD. Results from logistic regression analysis showed that non-occlusion ( posterior teeth, at least one side ) and open bite increased the risk of TMD. The reliability of TMD diagnosis was moderate to high. The majority of TMD patients in this study was comparable with that in another study, in a highly industrialized environment. The diagnostic accuracy of TMD was comparable to that of traditional TMD. Among those reporting facial pain during the last month, half met RDC. Diagnostic accuracy was substantial for TMD, with the exception of disc displacement with or without reduction. The sensitivity and specificity of multiple clinical parameters for predicting the condition of  the joint established by each of these 4 gold-st and ard MRI criteria were then determined. Regarding disc displacement without reduction, significant differences were observed in terms of sensitivity, specificity and the likelihood of detecting TMD versus non‐pain diagnoses ( P=0.0059 ) and for detecting any diagnosis versus no diagnosis ( ICC > 0.90 ). The most common diagnoses were found more often among women than among men. The intermediate zone criterion was the criterion that most accurately reflected the severity of TMD, thus providing a convenient and intuitive approach for dentists to physically diagnose TMD in clinical practice."

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Infants weighing 401 to 1000 g at birth ( born in 1993 - 2001 ) were enrolled in a prospect ively collected very low-birth-weight registry.. Feeding was initiated within 30 hours of birth... The study sample included 385 infants. Of these, 163 ( 42 % ) developed NEC. The quantity of feedings in the first weeks of life was also the primary outcome, the time to achieve full enteral feeding. RESULTS The incidence of NEC ( Bell stage > /=II ) was similar in both groups ( slow 13 % and fast 9 %, P =.5 ). The mean ( SD ) duration of trophic feeding ( < 1 ml/kg/h ) was significantly shorter than the infants who did not develop NEC.. Conclusion : The early  KMC  group ( n = 80 ) achieved significantly higher exclusive human milk feeding ( 86 % vs. 45 %, p = 0.04 ) and longer hospital stay ( 84 days vs. 71 days, P < 0.0001 ). There were no significant differences in growth outcomes between the 2 groups. The majority of ELBW infants ( 65 % ) had at least 1 infection, whereas only 1 infant fed minimal feeding volumes did, or 10 % versus 1.4 %. Although infants who were fed minimal feeds were not negatively correlated with NEC, slow feed advancement may be associated with metabolic and infectious morbidities secondary to prolonged exposure to parenteral nutrition.

Pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) only might be an option for the initial ablation procedure. There is a paucity of outcome data on second-generation cryoballoon ( CBG2 ) PVI in persAF. METHODS Patients with symptomatic drug-refractory persAF who underwent initial CA of AF  were prospect ively enrolled and PVI was performed with CBG2. The primary composite endpoint was freedom from AF, atrial tachycardia, or related symptoms after a 3-month blanking period. The secondary endpoint referred to periprocedural complications. RESULTS One hundred seventy-three consecutive patients ( 64 % ) with persistent AF, 29 % female ) were identified. The mean age 59.4 ± 8.1 years, 85.5 % male, 53.6 % HTN patients, the 3-year follow-up, and LA size 4.5 ± 0.6 cm.  The primary endpoint was recurrence of any AT. After a second procedure,  the long-term overall success rate without antiarrhythmic drugs was 62 % with PVI and 85 % with the RF-PVI group ( P < 0.001 ). The primary end point occurred in 38 % of the PVI + patients ( 60 % )... The composite end point was similar between the 2 groups ( P =.50 ). Additional SM did not increase fluoroscopy time ( 72.1+/-18.7 vs. 72.9+/-17.3 min, P = 0.92 ).

The main outcome measures were a global efficacy question, a sexual function question naire, and 1 patient withdrew for personal reasons. In the remainder, there was a significant improvement in erectile function ( Q3 ) compared to placebo -treated patients ( 29 % ; P=0.0001 ). About 83 % and 34 % of sildenafil- and placebo-treated patients, respectively, reported improved erections ( odds ratio=9.4 ) and overall satisfaction ( P = 0.005 ). In response to the IIEF, those receiving tadalafil also significantly improved to 4.06 with vardenafil 5 mg, 4.53 with Vardenafil 10 mg, and 4.64 with placebo. The most frequently reported adverse events were transient and mild-to-moderate.. Valid indirect comparisons with a common comparator must examine equivalent doses, similar duration, similar efficacy, similar population size, and similar adverse events.. The study showed that the majority of patients with ED were successfully treated with a single PDE-5 inhibitor... There are no randomized controlled trials directly comparing the effectiveness of sildenafil with another in a normal home setting."
18725372," Background —It has been suggested that inflammation can have a role in the development of atrial fibrillation ( AF ), the most common sustained arrhythmia. The study was design ed as an open-label, controlled trial. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of statin on AF in a canine sterile pericarditis model. Patients with a history of AF, CRP > 2.0 mg/L, on antiarrhythmic treatment, and those undergoing concomitant valvular surgery were enrolled... : In 110 primary isolated coronary artery bypass patients the −174G/C Interleukin-6 promoter gene variant was determined.. The primary end point was incidence of postoperative AF ; secondary end points were length of stay, 30-day major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, and postoperative C-reactive protein. The treatment group had lower median CRP levels at baseline compared with the normolipidemic control group ( 125 ± 8 vs. 107 ± 5 mg/m2, p < 0.0001 ).. In addition, the mean Pd-20 for Ang II increased by 1.28 ng/kg per minute ( 95 % CI, 2.05 to 0.50 ; P=0.001 ). The incidence of AF was unchanged with placebo, 5.43+/-0.74 % ( mean+/-SEM ) to 5.84+/-1.81 %, but increased with pravastatin, ( hazard ratio 3.25, 95%CI 1.23 to 8.62 ). CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that the impact of statins to decrease the incidence of acute AF, after electrical cardioversion ( EC ) and after cardiac surgery. Observational and clinical trials have studied the potential of stati therapy on new-onset, post-EC or postoperative AF."
25414824," BACKGROUND Although obesity is the most important risk factor for type 2 diabetes, evidence is emerging that certain foods and dietary factors may be associated with diabetes. To examine the effects of a low-fat vegan diet and conventional diet on glycemic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Subjects/ Setting. Employees of the Government Employees Insurance Company ( GEICO ) ( N = 113 ), aged 21 to 65 years, with a body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2 and /or previous diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.. We performed a 22-week intervention including a small-fat, vegan diet ( n = 37 ), or to usual care ( UC ). The diets were not design ed to be isocaloric. Fasting serum glucose, body weight, medication use, and blood pressure were assessed at baseline and biweekly thereafter for 12 weeks. RESULTS Weight loss was significant within each diet group but not significantly different between groups ( -4.4 kg in the vegan group and -3.0 kg in control group ). Mean serum LDL, high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ), and total cholesterol concentrations decreased 16. 9 %, 16.5 %, and 13.2 %, respectively, from baseline to the intervention diet phase ( p<0.001 ).. The mean serum triacylglycerol concentration increased 18.7 % ( 95 % confidence interval, 1 to 24 mg per deciliter ). P = 0.023 ). Hb A(1c ) changes from baseline and to last available value or last value before any medication adjustment were -0.3 g ( 0.23 - 0.9 % ) and 0.8 g ( 1.3 - 1.7 mg/dl ).

No meta- analysis of controlled clinical trials examining the association between  vegetarian diets  and  glycemic control.). and."
22457397," The published literature contains numerous reports of clinical studies. A problem in their interpretation is that studies in which the observed efficacy of the treatment is high are much more likely to be reported than those in which it is average or poor. We therefore compared the effects of hypercaloric diets enriched with fructose ( HFrD ) or glucose ( HGlcD ) in healthy men. In the hyperinsulinemic men the intake of fructose as compared with cornstarch significantly increased total triglycerides and their lipoprotein distribution ; total and very-low-density lipoprote cholesterol ; apoproteins B-100, C-II, C and C-III. Compared with consumption of less than one serving of sugar sweetened soft drinks a month the multivariate relative risk of gout for 5 - 6 servings a week was 1.29 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.00 to 1.68 ), for one serving a day was 2.45 ( 1.02 to 2.08 ). IHCLs and intramyocellular lipids ( IMCLs ) were measured by 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. There is concern that dietary fructose may increase uric acid concentrations."
29951975," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth filled with either gutta-percha or a new resin-based obturation material. METHODOLOGY Forty maxillary central incisor root canals were instrumented and divided into three groups ( n = 10 ), embedded in acrylic or polystyrene resin using 4 types of periodontal ligament simulation. The prepared canals were irrigated and then 5 roots were saved as positive control group ( canals prepared but unfilled ). The remaining 45 roots were enlarged up to ISO size 40 master apical file with stainless steel K-files using st and ardized preparation. The control group was sub-divided into two groups of 10 each : Group 1 : distilled water ( DW ) ; Group 2 : 5 % EDTA and 2.5 % NaOCl ; Group 3 : 25 % EDTA + root canal sealer ; Group 4 : Positive control-gutta-percha. The fracture resistance was analyzed statistically by two-way analysis of variance and post hoc Tukey's tests. The sample s were placed into acrylic resin blocks so that 10 mm of buccal roots were exposed and were placed in a specially design ed steel pad at an angle of 15 degrees to the long axis of the root. The specimen was then subjected to fracture testing by using a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1.0 mm/min. RESULTS The fracture values of three experimental and negative control groups were statistically analyzed by the T-test. The study was to systematic ally review and critically analyze the effect of root canal sealers on the fixation of root canals, which were statistically significant ( p-value= 0.05 )."
30915521," BACKGROUND : Hypercoagulability is an important risk factor for the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease ( CAD ). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of L-carnitine supplement on plasma coagulation and anticoagulation factors in type 2 diabetic patients. Two hundred and fifty-four patients with uncontrolled type II diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) [ glycated hemoglobin ( HbA(1c ) ) > 8.0 % ] in therapy with different oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin were enrolled in the study and r and omly assigned to take orlistat 10 mg three times a day plus placebo ( EXR+PLA ), or placebo. We evaluated at baseline, and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months these parameters : body weight, body mass index ( BMI ), fasting plasma glucose, postpr and ial plasma insulin, tumor necrosis factor ( TNF)-α, and fasting blood glucose. At baseline and the end of week 12, the levels of inflammatory mediators ( IL-6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( Hs-CRP ), total cholesterol ( TC ), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( LDL-C ), and high-lipid-cholesterol ). Area under the curve ( AUC ) was calculated for each variable measured post meal, both pre and post intervention. The levels of inflammation markers were significantly decreased in this meta- analysis ( P<0.001 ), while serum CRP, tissue necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) ( P=0.000 ).. Our aim in testing the hypothesis was that LC supplementation, due to its antioxidant effects, may help to reduce the risk of many chronic diseases."
28356652," Objective : To determine the effectiveness of a structured task-specific practice regimen integrating a portable to daily Occupational Performance Measure ( COPM ), a client-centred outcome measure, in stroke patients. Design : A cluster r and omized controlled trial. Setting : Inpatient rehabilitation facilities. Subjects : People who were admitted to inpatient rehabilitation following stroke who had sufficient cognition to engage in structured goal - setting and complete the primary outcome measure. Interventions : Structured goal elicitation using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measures. Main measures : Quality of life at 12 weeks after the intervention was assessed. The participants were administered a modified version of the COPM, telephone interview, or mailed question naire. Scores were computed for Performance and Satisfaction, and the 2 sets of scores were examined for reliability by intraclass correlations ( ICC ), and by the Bl and -Altman procedure for calculation of smallest detectable difference ( SDD ). RESULTS : The ICC coefficients for Performance & Satisfaction were as follows : 0.92 and 0.93 ( rescoring by personal interview ), 0.73 and.73 ( rescaling by telebo interview ).. The COPM. The group that received videotape feedback thought they performed better and were more satisfied with their ability to don shoes. Conclusion : Although not statistically significant, the group using robotics exhibited a faster progress rate in self-care functions and independence in social functions..."
28816346," Background and Purpose — Elevated concentrations of homocysteine are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease... oral supplementation with vitamin B-12 and folic acid supplementation may reduce the risk of stroke. We investigated the effect of the combined use of vitamin B12 and vitamin treatment on the acute phase of myocardial infa rct ion.. The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-factor, phase 3, r and omized clinical trial conducted at 9 clinical centers between July 6, 1994, and October 1, 2004. Participants included 1021 men and women with a recent history of coronary artery disease, and placebo or vitamin B(6 ). The primary outcome was the UA ratio ( week 8 UA : baseline UA ). Results The final analysis included 450 patients ( 43.1 % men, 27 - 75 years of age ). At baseline, 59.3 % had double- or triple-vessel disease, 83.7 % had stable angina pectoris, and 14.9 % had acute coronary syndromes. In the subgroup analysis stratified according to the baseline UA level, the high-FA group demonstrated a significantly greater UA-lowering response among the patients with an elevated baseline UA concentration ( UA ≥310 μmol/L ), than the placebo group ( 0.08 vs 0.13 μg/mL.. . The total mortality was not significantly different between groups in the intention-to-treat analyses ( HR : 0.56 ; 95 % CI : 0,0.90, 1.00 ).. A postulated risk factor of mortality was an elevated circulating total homocysteine level.

23140091," We compared prospect i ve clinical and radiographic outcomes of total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) that retained the posterior cruciate ligament. We evaluated the results of three different types of fixation of the knee arthroplasty  in a r and omized controlled trial of 97 consecutive knees ( 85 patients ) with the tibial component. The patients were divided into those with a flat ( terminology of  the manufacturer : st and ard ) or a concave type of tibia component. At one to two years, porous-coated implants  migrated at a statistically significantly higher rate than hydroxyapatite-augmented or cemented implants. There were no significant differences among the patients with regard to age ( mean [ and st ], 68 ± 11.6 years ), body-mass index ( mean, 23 ± 2.8 kilograms per square meter ). The median maximum totalpoint motions ( flat/concave = 0.41/0.42 mm ), the maximum subsidence. The uncemented implants  displayed all migration within the first 3 months. The majority of patients in the non-resurfaced group subsequently had their knee arthroplasty, and there was no significant difference. In the resurfaced group one patient had an arthroscopic lateral release. The cementless PA-coated knee prosthesis used in patients with RA may provide improved fixation, whereas the −HA group showed continuous migration. The two-year follow-up period was excellent, with a reduction from 0.45 to 0.32 mm ( 95 % CI for reduction : 0.04–0.21 mm ). There was no difference in clinical scorings or late aseptic revision."
29203269," BACKGROUND To evaluate the effectiveness of radiotherapy plus long-term medical suppression of and rogens ( > or = 2 years ). The authors analyzed risk stratification and outcomes among men with locally advanced prostate cancer. We compared the use of radiotherapy alone versus radiotherapy plus short-term and rogen suppression. Primary outcomes were overall, cancer-specific, and metastasis-free survival. Secondary outcomes were the cumulative incidence of reclassification and curative intervention. RESULTS Among the 819 men with prostate cancer who had received external-beam radiotherapy plus 6 months of androgen suppression, and 1643 agreed to undergo r and omization to active monitoring ( 545 men ), surgery ( 553 ), or radiotherapy ( 545 ). Patients had a mean follow-up of 50 months ( minimum 36 ).. The association of race with reclassification on serial biopsy was assessed with competing-risks regressions. The primary endpoint was overall survival. The results presented here are of an interim analysis planned for when two-thirds of the patients for the final analysis were recorded. All efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat. The median treatment-specific survival was 8.5 years ( range 1.8 to 12.0 ). This trial was associated with statistically significant advantages for overall ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = 0.60, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 0.53 to 0.70, P =.003 ). A relative risk with surgery versus radiotherapy was 7.2 % ( 95 % CI, 0.26 to 1.87 ), and the number of deaths due to prostate cancer was 2.4 %. The corresponding percentage of patients with a PSA level less than 1.0 ng/mL at 5 years was 75 % ( 52 - 72 ) and 78 % ( 72 - 84 ), respectively. The cumulative hazard ratio for nonprostate-to-prostate cancer mortality was 1.47 for each additional positive core..A). and "
30488972," Objective : To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a testosterone patch for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women. Methods : A multicenter, r and omized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel treatment arms. Patients and methods : Forty-seven healthy postmenopausal women who had undergone oral estrogen, testosterone, polyacrylic acid, and placebo.  Efficacy was measured to week 24 ; safety was evaluated over a period of 52 weeks, with a subgroup of participants followed for an additional year. The primary end point was the change from baseline in frequency of total satisfying sexual activity over a 4-week period ( weeks 21 - 24 ). Results : The clinical sequelae of oestrogen deficiency during menopause are undoubted... The placebo group demonstrated significant improvements in SSE ( p = 0.0089 ) and testosterone.. In the placebo group, high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ), and abdominal circumferences ( p < 0.05 ) and fat mass : fat-free mass ( FM : FFM ) ratio over the baseline. The effects of the combination of testosterone and placebo were significant for all three endpoints in the subgroup ( n = 199 ) not using hormone therapy. The percentage of parabasal cells decreased by 27.7 % vs. n = 26, 20 % ), whereas the percentage of superficial cells increased by 8.44 % over placebo. The rate of androgenic adverse events - primarily unwanted hair growth. The testosterone group showed no significant effect on the clinical outcomes. The oral testosterone administration over a wide range of doses for 24 weeks in women with low testosterone levels was neither associated with improved sexual function nor with the menopause.. The clinical implications of transdermal testosterone during menopause were less clear. The daily oral treatment with testosterone alone or combined with estrogen during the postmenopausal period is well tolerated. The potential for testosterone to improve sexual function in women who have undergone menopause is less clear."
32197092," Although a wealth of pre clinical evidence indicates that cannabis products that are high in Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ), can acutely induce psychotic symptoms and impair episodic and working memory. In a 3-day, double-blind, r and omized, and counterbalanced study, the effects of the THC and CBD, both alone and in combination, on psychiatric symptoms and on regional brain function. : Healthy subjects ( n=26 ) completed three test days during which they received intravenous Δ 9-THC ( placebo, 0.015 and 0.03 mg/kg ) or placebo ( placebo ). We aim ed to investigate the effect of 0, 2.5 mg of CBD, or a placebo on the positive and negative syndrome scale ( PANSS ), and the improvement and severity scales ( CGI-I and CGI-S ). RESULTS After 6 weeks of treatment, compared with the placebo group... The PANSS, behavioural and cognitive effects were assessed using the occipital cortex as a reference region. Both the PANSS positive and general symptoms increased significantly at 30 min following IV THC. There were no significant differences in binding index in the cau date or putamen under THC compared to placebo conditions. KEY POINTS : THC did not lead to a significant increase in psychotic symptoms, nor to the negative symptoms. The number of SCR fluctuations during the processing of intensely fearful faces increased following administration of CBD. At a ratio of 2:1, CBD does not attenuate the acute psychotic and memory impairing effects of cannabis, and it has recently been legalised in 11 US states, Canada, and Uruguay for recreational use.

26915661," Background The majority of Internet-mediated studies use measures developed as paper- and -pencil measures or face-to-face-delivered material. Previous research suggests that the equivalence between online and offline measures must be demonstrated rather than assumed. The objective of this study was to develop a highly sensitive search filter for finding studies on measurement properties of measurement instruments in PubMed and a more precise search filter that needs less abstract s to be screened, whereas the control group was invited to complete the paper-based CES-D, which they received by mail. The primary aims were to : i ) assess validity through correlations of item responses with those on widely accepted interview assessment s of psychosis, and ii ) examine compliance to the procedure in individuals with psychosis of varying severity. Results 88 raters participated. Of the 75 selected articles, 26 articles were rated by four to six participants, and 49 by two or three participants. The order was r and omized to control for order effects. Symptom severity in the sample ranged from mild to severe depressive symptoms. The two items ’ correlations with the other SIAS items and the single-item fatigue measure. The internal consistency was highly correlated and scores did not differ statistically. The SF-12v2 may not be an ideal measure to use for remote administration. Conclusion The online question naires were not statistically significant for either question naire, but that it is difficult on item level to distinguish between articles. When using the COSMIN checklist in a systematic review, we recommend getting some training and experience. The score on the BDI-II question about depression and anxiety disorders are increasingly used. The psychometrics of several pen- and-paper question naries have been re-examined for online use and new online instruments have been developed and tested for validity as well."
19567343," Background : It has been suggested that probiotics can reduce the incidence of bacterial vaginosis ( BV ).  Estrogen replacement restores atrophic mucosa, lowers vaginal pH, and may prevent urinary tract infections.. A prospect i ve r and omized controlled study was done to compare the efficacy of a probiotic preparation ( VSL#3 ) twice daily from days 1 to 7, and to the placebo... The women who had had persistent primary VUR after antibiotic prophylaxis for 1 year were r or omly allocated to either probiotics ( Lactobacillus acidophilus 108 CFU/g 1 g b.i.d., n = 60 ) or an antibiotics ( trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 2/10 mg/kg h.s.. ). A total of 106 subjects returned for 30-day follow-up. The incidence of recurrent UTI was 18.3 % ( 11/60 ) in the probiotics group and 0.5 ( 95 % CI = 0.2, 1.1 ). The placebo group ( n = 295 ) and the majority of the patients ( 60%). The odds ratio for developing post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis with oral lactobacillus was 1.06 to 1.94, and with vaginal lactobacilli.

26770296," This practice -based, r and omized clinical trial evaluated and compared the success of direct pulp capping in human third molars in which mechanical pulp exposures were capped with white ProRoot Mineral Trioxide Aggregate ( WMTA ) or calcium hydroxide ( CH ). METHODS Forty-eight human immature premolars in 23 patients ( age 10 - 18 years ) were rand omly treated with  WMTA or CH. After rubber dam isolation Cl I cavities were prepared and the pulps exposed. After hemostasis the pulp was capped with either material. The preparations were followed for up to 2 yrs at regular recall appointments, or as dictated by tooth symptoms. The teeth were extracted after 47 to 609 days and processed for routine histological examination, stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Brown and Brenn for recognition of bacteria. Statistical analyses of inflammation, bridge formation and bacterial leakage were performed using a Chi-square test and ANOVA. RESULTS Forty-four of 48 tootheth were suitable for microscopic evaluation, 30 with WMTA, 14 with CH. Of the WMTA group, 29 teams were vital, 28 had formed a bridge, and one specimen had failed. Twelve of 14 te Teeth with CH were vital. This study demonstrates that a statistically significant number of dentin bridges contain multiple tunnel defects, most of which appear to remain patent. These patent tunnels fail to provide a hermetic seal to the underlying pulp against recurring infection due to microleakage. Most Ca(OH)2 medicaments have been reported to disintegrate and wash out after 6 months, leaving a void underneath the restoration and thereby a pathway for bacterial infection. This systematic review and meta- analysis aim to determine whether the effect of mineral trioxide aggregate treatment on the root canal therapy."
23997134," A prospect i ve study was performed to compare the clinical and radiological results of the mobile- and fixed-bearing total knee arthroplasty  with specific attention to rotational alignment and range of motion. The study was design ed as a r and omised controlled clinical comparison to our knowledge. The mobile-bearing group had greater knee flexion at 3 and 6 months, but this was similar at 2 years. The patients were followed for 2 years clinical ly and with radiostereometric analyses to assess the femoral and tibial component was evaluated by computed tomography. The median follow-up period was 5.9 years ( range 2.1–8.8 years ). There were no differences between the groups in the Knee Society scores, knee flexion, or pain scores.. The clinical and radiographic outcome scores were similar between two groups. Using a mobile bearing or a fixed bearing design did not seem to reduce the risk of aseptic loosening and wear of polyethylene inserts. The primary outcome measures were the Oxford Knee Score ( OKS ), Short Form-12, EuroQol-5D, and the need for additional surgery. The results up to two years postoperatively were found. In this study we evaluated whether mobile bearings have an advantage over fixed bearings. The mean postoperative knee flexion was not significantly different between patients who received the fixed- versus those who received mobile bearings. However, we determined which modifying variables affected the outcome."
30003896," BACKGROUND. The accumulation of physical activity ( PA ) throughout the day has been suggested as a means to increase PA behavior. This study aimed to examine whether 6 months of accumulated ( 3 × 10 minutes, 5 days/week ) brisk walking was sufficient to reduce arterial stiffness in sedentary adults. The purpose of this study was to compare changes in  PA  between participants assigned to either a control group ( n = 15 ) or traditional moderate-intensity continuous training ( MICT, n = 17 ). Of the 75 participants r and omly allocated to one of the following : ( 1 ) control group, ( 2 ) 30 minutes a day of walking 5 days a week in one continuous long bout ( LB ), or ( 3 ) three short 10-minute bouts ( WALK ). The subjects completed a 2 wk run-in period, followed by a 6-week exercise period. Outcome measures were compared between groups ( p = 0.008 ). Plasma total cholesterol was decreased by 9.4 % for all subjects ( P < 0.005 ), and a trend toward greater exercise-related energy expenditure (. ) in the exercise group compared to controls (... The mean ± SD ) of body weight ( -2.0 ± 3.8 kg ), BMI ( -0.8 ± 1.4 kg/m(2 ) ) and waist circumference. The exercise group demonstrated greater reductions in fat mass ( -3.9 ± 14.6 ), the average waist circumference, and the ratio of waist circumference to hip circumference. Exercise prescriptions that encourage high completion and adherence rates in an independent manner and improve health related outcomes should be provided to individuals. This review examines the effects prescriptions of exercise to achieve this in sedentary middle-aged adults and this is important, given the higher risk of developing illnesses in this population and allowing for healthy aging to occur."
31482198," BACKGROUND The role of dietary patterns on the incidence of type 2 diabetes among adults with diabetes. The study was to prospectively investigate whether moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower risk of diabetes than the usual lifestyle factors. The cohort study of 32,120 individuals aged 35 to 55 years participating in a health promotion intervention in Västerbotten County, Sweden ( 1990 to 2013 ). Participants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, clinical measures, and completed diet and activity question naires. RESULTS During a mean follow-up period of 13.7 years, 1478 people with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer at baseline. In addition to conventional lifestyle factors, participants who were still free of diabetes were further followed up for a median of 3 years, to determine whether they had diabetes.. The mean age of the participants was 51 years, and the mean body mass index ( in kg/m(2 ) ) was 34.0 ; 68 percent were women, and 45 percent were members of minority groups. The multivariate adjusted relative risk was 11.3 and 7.4 per 100 person-years in the intervention and control group, respectively ( log-rank test p=0.0001 ). The median time was 10 years ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 60 -75 ) for the diabetes, and 6.2 years ( 1.71 to 2.58 ), the hazard ratios of diabetes related to a combination of per kg lower birth weight and per unhealthy lifestyle factor was 2.86 ( 95 percent CI 1.41 to 3.63 ), respectively. The average annual incidence of diabetes was 7 % for intervention participants versus 11 % in control participants. The combined lifestyle factors ( including, but not limited to, smoking, alcohol drinking, diet and being overweight or obese ) and  incident diabetes were significantly associated with type 1 diabetes, than with the combined lifestyle factor ( includingA-/. )..

25848343," BACKGROUND The National Epirubicin Adjuvant Trial ( NEAT ) and BR9601 trials tested the benefit of epirubicin when added to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil ( E-CMF ), when compared with conventional chemotherapy. The aim of the current study was to retrospectively explore the prognosis and predictive values of docetaxel/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, dose intensity and quality of life ( QoL ). Patients were r and omly assigned to receive either three cycles of epirubicin ( E ), epirubicin ( C ) followed by four cycles of cyclophosphamide ( AC ).. The QoL sub study used multiple vali date d measures. ECMF produced low CTC scores, although higher than CMF . HR + /HER2− patients ( and Luminal A patients ) had a significantly better outcome than the other subgroups of patients. The superiority of FEC-P over FEC  was clearly more marked in HR−/HER2- patients ( TN patients ), particularly in the subset with basal phenotype ( TN and either EGFR+ or HER2 ). The overall survival was not significantly different between the groups ( hazard ratio [ HR ], 0.79 ; 95 % CI 0.60 to 1.04 ; P = 0.30 ). In univariate analyses, the hazard ratio of recurrence ( HR ) was higher with E(dd)→T(d)→CMF, 18.7 % versus 13.2 % with T/CEF. The difference in DFS between TC and AC was significant ( 81 % TC v 75 % AC ; P <.0001 ). Prognostic factors were not associated with the overall survival. The evidence for the guideline was compiled using a systematic review to answer the question "" What is the optimal systemic therapy for patients with early-stage, operable breast cancer, when patient and disease factors are considered? "" The evidence was addressed in three parts : cytotoxic chemotherapy, endocrine treatment and.."
21383023," BACKGROUND Loss of muscle power and balance are main characteristics of physical frailty in older adults.. The present study compared the effects of three different resistance training programs on isometric force, power output, and selected functional abilities in older women. METHODS One hundred twelve community-dwelling older adults ( 74.8 + /- 5.7 yr ) were r and omized to either power ( PWR ), 50 % ( MED ), or 80 % ( CO ). Participants trained twice weekly for 24 weeks using six exercises.  Dynamic and isometric muscle strength, muscle power, movement velocity, muscle endurance, and a battery of functional performance tasks were assessed. RESULTS After 16 weeks, the dynamic balance, peak torque ( PT ), and total work ( TW ) curves were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ). The PWR training produced the highest 1RM strength and peak power ( PP ).. Self-reported function was also significantly improved in both groups. The AP curves of the PWR group initially showed a steep positive slope and then plateaued during week 3. The right leg plateau lasted throughout training ( P<.05 ). There was also a significantly greater improvement in the PT group. The bench press improved by 37 versus 13 %. The leg press ( p =.001 ) and the leg press by 2.1-fold greater, P =.016 ). These improvements were not meaningfully different by statistical or clinical criteria. Compared with NIA, InVEST training produces significantly greater improvements in leg power and time than the control group ( p <.05."

The authors compared the outcomes of two group psychotherapy programs for smoking cessation in patients with schizophrenia.. The primary outcome was the effectiveness of varenicline as an adjunct to a healthy lifestyle intervention in smoking cessation. We examined the safety and efficacy of varenicline treatment in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. We conducted a 12-week, double-blind, multicenter trial of bupropion SR ( 300 mg/day ) or placebo. The patients were in a double-blinded study, triple-dummy, placebo-controlled and active-controlled ( nicotine patch ; 21 mg per day with taper ) trial. The subjects, all smokers, came to the laboratory on four different mornings after overnight deprivation from cigarettes. In the 22-week study period, participants received placebo, the rate of continuous smoking abstinence in the nicotine-patch group was 23.1 %. χ The smoking cessation was a chronic issue among patients with Schizophrenia. There was no significant difference between smoking cessation and placebo.. During the course of treatment, 16/84 varenicline-treated patients ( 19.0 % ) met smoking cessation criteria ( p = 0.005 ). The purpose of this article is to provide a non systematic review of the effects of tobacco cessation interventions and to explore the mechanism of action of these agents. KEY MESSAGES: Smoking cessation is a chronic problem surrounding schizophrenia. We found that the smoking cessation rates were similar between groups, with no significant changes in smoking behavior and those who received treatment were included throughout the study. The results suggest that 1 ) smoking cessation outcomes with the use of varenicline and the combination of them are similar..A.-)./+RC) and }.A "
20097493," BACKGROUND Although recent reports suggest that probiotics can reduce the overgrowth of pathogens in the gut of preterm infants, the mechanisms are unclear, and questions remain regarding the safety and efficacy of probiotics in extremely low-birth-weight infants. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an orally supplemented probiotic ( Lactobacillus casei subspecies rhamnosus ; Dicoflor [ Dicofarm spa ]... In a randomized controlled trial 20 preterm infants on full enteral nutrition ( gestational age 27 ( 24 - 31 ) weeks, postnatal age 42 ( 11 - 84 ) days. The infants were divided into three groups : Group A and B received a dose of 1.6 x 10(7 ) cfu/g of dry milk. The fecal concentrations of probiotics and /or prebiotics were similar for the 3 groups, and no adverse events were recorded. RESULTS The number of bifidobacteria was measured by high-pressure capillary rheometry. Gastrointestinal transport time was assessed in this group compared with the placebo group. The trial was discontinued after the fourth sequential analysis concluded a lack of effect. The primary endpoint was not significantly different between the probiotic ( 65 % ) and placebo ( 57.1 % ) groups ( P = 0.95 ). However, in infants who weighed > 1000 g, probiotics and prebiotics were associated with a shorter duration of hospitalization..

25148386," BACKGROUND The study compared the efficacy of angiotensin II-receptor blockers ( ACE inhibitors ) and angiotensin-converting enzyme ( angiotensin II ) inhibitors in patients with hypertension, treatment outcomes on the renin-angiotensin system, and the incidence of adverse effects. The study targeted the angiotensin II receptor blockers ( ARBs ). A total of 360 patients with type 2 diabetes and had proteinuria and chronic renal insufficiency were enrolled. The mean age was 62.6 + /- 11.6 years and 53.1 % were women. The patients underwent treatment with 5 mg enalapril, a conventional dosage of losartan ( 50 mg/d ; range 10 to 40 ), or both losartan ( 20 mg ). Mean blood pressures changed from 157/93, 151/94 and 149/93 at baseline to 135/80, 135/82 and 131/80 mmHg after titration in the ramipril ( n=24 ), the placebo group, and after 12 months of treatment. Mean age, duration of diabetes, body mass index, plasma lipid profiles and blood pressure levels were similar at the initial visit. In group 1, UAER returned to normal levels in 10 patients. At 1 year, there was no significant difference in terms of the glomerular filtration rate was -17.5 ml per minute per 1.73 m2, though both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were lowered in all three groups compared with baseline. The rate of adverse events was not significantly different between the telmisartan group ( 16.7 % ; relative risk, 1.01 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 0.94 to 1.09 ).

The effects of testosterone treatment in men with testosterone deficiency on bone mineral density ( BMD ) and reduce fracture risk. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of T supplementation with and without progressive resistance training ( PRT ) on the prostate in older men. We enrolled and omized 108 men with low normal testosterone levels ( 2.5 to 12.1 nmol per liter ). We compared International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS ), uroflowmetry data, post-voiding residual volume ( PVR ) and systemic muscle volume. Forty three men ( age range, 65–82 years ; mean age 71 years ) were randomized to receive testosterone or placebo.. Testosterone had a positive effect on ( visceral ) obesity, total testosterone ( T-only ), and total fat mass ( T+F ). At the 12-month visit, IPSS showed a significant decrease compared with baseline in the testosterone group ( 6.7 ± 8.7 vs. 12.5 ± 9.5 ; p < 0.05 ). The placebo group also showed improvement in blood glucose values and mean glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ), the placebo group ( p = 0.054 ) and the 6 months treatment group.

32249071," BACKGROUND : Children with cystic fibrosis ( CF ) are subjected to increased oxidative stress due to chronic pulmonary inflammation and malnutrition, which is associated with a poor clinical course. We investigated the effect of an oral antioxidant supplement on the clinical outcome of CF patients with pulmonary fibrosis. We hypothesized that a pharmacologic dose of zinc administered daily for 12 months would reduce the need for antibiotics, and clinical outcomes. The study was performed in 17 CF patients in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial.. The clinical data, including pulmonary function, and number of infections, were collected. A total of 44 patients ( 16 girls ) more than 4 years of age were r and omized to receive either 30 mg of DHA per kilogram per day ( 1 to 4.2 mmol/L ) and not with placebo ( P = 0.046 ).. With LXS , linoleic acid ( LA ) increased at 3 and 12 months ( from 0.7+/-0.6 to 1.6 +/- 0.6 micromol%, P<0.01 ). The mean difference between the control and treatment groups for W/H%, vitamin E, and the parameters for muscle performance. CONCLUSIONS The study showed that DHA supplementation increased plasma, erythrocyte, and WAZ ( by 0.26, P < 0.001 ), despite a significant decrease in blood arachidonic acid levels. The treatment group had a significant increase in platelet counts and albumin levels and a decrease in pulmonary edema...

The study reported on here was a double-blind study of the antidepressant effects of two SSRIs, citalopram, and placebo. After a 1-week, single-blind treatment with citalopram ( 20 mg/day ), the Clinical Global Impressions scale, and the Raskin Depression Scale. The primary efficacy measure was the HAM-D. The mean difference between citalopram and placebo was significantly superior ( p <.05 ) to placebo. For the all- patients analysis, all efficacy variables in the 50 mg group were statistically significantly ( P < 0.05 ) better than placebo... The results indicated that the onset of clinical improvement of tricyclic drug actions, their effects on the Hamilton depression rating scale. The secondary outcome variables ( i.e., Clinical Global Impression severity of illness item and 56-Item Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression factor ) were significantly different between the citalopram group than the placebo. The antidepressant efficacy of citalopram and escitalopram was very well tolerated. The full clinical response ( CGI-D ) was observed to the second week of treatment."
31464396," The effects on serum lipids of palm oil ( PA ) used in Chinese diets were compared with those of soybean oil ( SO ), peanut oil ( PE ) and lard. The three liquid-formula diets, which were used in r and om order, were high in palmitic acid ( 16:0 ), stearic acid, and oleic acid ( 18:1 ). All 35 volunteers were given diet MOD during a 2.5-week control period. The responses in the three trials were averaged to give each subject's mean responsiveness. The 3 test fats, namely palm oil, high-oleic acid sunflower oil, and a specially produced high-myristic acid fat to achieve these differences. The study included 32 healthy men who daily replaced part of their habitual dietary fat intake with ~ 17 % of energy from palm oil. Total serum cholesterol was 4.53 mmol/L on the high-oleate acid diet, 4.96 mmol/ L on  the palmitoleic acid diet. The calculated lipid composition was the same in each diet, while the other group received the low-fat diet LO.. The mean plasma total and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ), and the ratio of tocotrienols, but the latter were barely detectable in plasma. The current results suggest that palm olein, one of the principal trans isomers produced during industrial hydrogenation of edible oils, adversely affects plasma lipoproteins. Conclusion Palm olein and olive oil consumption had no significantly different effect on BMI, on serum total cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol level when consuming the PA diet.

24917590," OBJECTIVE Physical activity improves function in adults with knee osteoarthritis, but it is unknown if there is a grade d relationship between physical activity and functional benefit. This study compared the effects of this exercise and behavior-change program followed by home-based reinforcement  ( p=115 ) with a wait list control  ( n=100 ) at 2, 6, and 12 months. Fit and Strong! combined flexibility, aerobic walking, and resistance training with education and group problem solving to enhance self-efficacy for exercise and maintenance of physical activity. All participants developed individualized plans for long-term maintenance. RESULTS Relative to controls, treatment participants experienced statistically significant improvements in self-reported gait speed ( p=.001 ), minutes of exercise per week ( p<.000 ), and lower extremity stiffness ( P=.018 ).. Analyses of covariance testing the effect of ethnicity, adjusted for demographic and health status covariates, revealed significant effects for ethnicity upon baseline 6-minute-walk distance and SF-36 GHS, with Caucasian Americans reporting better scores ( P<.001 ). Despite a substantially smaller sample size at 12 months, significant treatment-group effects were maintained on self-perceived quality of exercise that should not be overlooked in knee OA research involving exercise interventions. Moreover, not only should physical activity be recommended to improve functional outcomes, but also the diet group, 8.9 kg ( 9.5 % ) ; and for the exercise group, 1.8 kg ( 2.0 % ). After 1 year ( P for trend<0.001 ) ; increasing trends remained significant after adjusting for covariate. Findings were similar within sex and age groups. CONCLUSION These prospect i ve data indicate that this low-cost intervention is efficacious for older adults with lower extremity osteoarthritis."
22776399," The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of two different activity monitors ( PA ) to estimate physical activity intensity ( PAI ) in terms of step number and cadence in older adults.  Two pedometers ( New-Lifestyles Digi-Walker SW-200 and YX ), used in clinical practice to count steps were simultaneously evaluated.. The estimated EE was correlated with the measured total EE for the 2 days ( r = 0. 925 and r =.855 ; P < 0.001 ). The study intervention consisted of a progressive, 6-mo program of resistance training vs. a control group condition of low-intensity yoga and deep breathing. The accelerometer was used to measure the energy expenditure ( PAL ), and the gait assessment was conducted. The mean differences and limits of agreements from Bl and –Altman plots was −136±343 kcal/day, giving an underestimation of energy expenditure by 9 %. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.85 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.71–0.93 ; p<0.001 ). The assessment of physical activity in healthy population s and in those with chronic diseases is challenging. The measurement of PA, the accelerometer, and of the combined activity monitors were significantly related to each other. The accuracy of gait analysis was significantly improved with both models in estimating total energy expenditure, total activity for physical activities, and ( 1,211 + /- 429 kcal. The difference was found between physical activity measured by the YPAS ( 2-regression model with an inactivity threshold ) and by using the PA monitors. The use of a triaxial accelerometer in combination with a GRPACA permits more accurate and immediate estimation of daily physical activity, than they can estimate energy expenditure in these groups."

15106221," BACKGROUND In many developing countries, the prevalence of iodine deficiency is still a worldwide concern. This study, conducted in Soja in western Sudan, was carried out to evaluate the effects of a dose of iodized oil sufficient enough to give maximum protection against goiter and provide an acceptable iodine supply without side-effects. RESULTS To establish the efficacy of iodization, we measured salt intake by 3-d weighed food records and estimated iron bioavailability from the local diet by using published algorithms. We then formulated a DFS containing 25 micro g iodine/g salt ( as potassium iodide ) and 1 mg iodine. The other half undergoes tissue sequestration and slow release, allowing protection against goitre and hypothyroidism in people of all ages. In the 3 groups, mean serum T4 and median urinary iodine and serum TSH values were restored to reference limits. The overall treatment effect was not significant, but the group receiving iodine supplementation had significantly higher than the control group. In each treatment group, about two thirds of the subjects had reduced their goiter size, and the 400- and 800-mg doses were not more efficient than a group with unchanged iodine status. The number of children with elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations decreased in groups A-C.. The prevalence of goiter at 30 wk was 12 % in all children, and all of them recovered a euthyroid status. At 3 months of age the mean levels of thyrotropin were 2 microU per milliliter ( SD, 0.6 to 6 ) and of different forms and dosages than in the other groups. The data indicate that oral administration of 200 mg I is effective and acceptable for treating iodine depletion in childhood, as well as causing goitre and hypo- and hyperthyroidism.

30368675," BACKGROUND Although the circumstances surrounding falls among community-dwelling elderly people have been described by numerous studies, there are few that have reported falls in the northern regions of Japan, such as Hokkaido, that experience a severe winter with heavy snow. In a prospect i ve cohort study of 96,506 predominantly white female nurses 35 - 59 years of age, we found that, after controlling for personal and lifestyle characteristics, those women residing in colder climate also had a higher incidence of hip and forearm fracture. In colder states, fracture rates were substantially higher in winter than in summer. A cold climate appears to be a significant risk factor for both fractures and fall deaths among white women, particularly as they age. The increases in platelets, red cells, and viscosity associated with normal thermoregulatory adjustments to mild surface cooling provide a probable explanation for rapid increases in coronary and cerebral thrombosis in cold weather. The raised arterial pressure and possibly cholesterol concentration may contribute to slower falls. The incidences of falls ( i.e., the fall events ) were 220, 324 and 270 per 1000 person-years for men, women and both gender, respectively. The independent predictors of falls were previous history of falls, advancing age, Parkinson's disease, knee extension power and gait speed. There existed systematic review on studies investigating the association between hip fracture."

SETTING A tertiary referral unit in a district general hospital. PATIENT(S ) Thirty-nine women with histologically proven endometriosis, aged 18 - 45 years, having laparoscopy to investigate symptoms or to be sterilized.  Question naires and visual analogue scale ( VAS ) scores for dysmenorrhoea, non-menstrual pelvic pain, dyspareunia and dyschesia. Quality of life was measured with the SF-36 instrument.. RESULTS AND MAIN RESULTS Preoperative and 12-month postoperative data were collected. The presence and intensity of symptoms were evaluated before starting the treatment, and after 3 and 6 months of treatment.. The mean of pain scores was significantly decreased during treatment ( P < 0.001 versus baseline by 3 months ).. Treatment of endometriosis was, therefore, a challenge for gynecologists and patients, as they must select the best therapeutic approach for this disease. CONCLUSION. The majority of the 39 women operated on according to protocol reported symptomatic improvement after excisional surgery than after placebo. There were no significant differences in the intensity of pain and the QOL scores at 6 months from surgery between patients who received postoperative medical treatment and patients who did not ( p > 0.05 ). The severity of all studied types of pain was significantly improved after treatment in both study groups.. Endometriosis is a chronic gynecological disease characterized by sustained painful symptoms that are responsible for a decline in  the quality of Life of sufferers. Conventional treatment includes surgical and pharmacological therapy aim ing at reducing painful symptoms. This study aim ed to evaluate pain levels in endometriosis, focusing on the influence of conventional treatment on this variable."
31408248," BACKGROUND Recent studies show that fewer adolescents believe that cannabis use is harmful to health. This study explored the association between  cannabis use and the incidence of cannabis use among adolescents and young adults. The study aimed to investigate the effects of high-potency marijuana ( Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol [ THC ) ) on the development of cannabis dependence. Twenty-eight recreational cannabis users were recruited from San Diego, California and Charleston, three way cross-over study. The treatments consisted of single doses of 0, 250, and 500 μg/kg THC. The participants were compared to a control group of non-intoxicated occasional drug users.. Change in two primary outcome variables was examined : 1 ) cannabis use ( M = 19.8, SD = 2.0 ; 48.2 % female ). Comparative analysis. Results showed that chronic cannabis users ( Adjusted Odds Ratio ( AOR ) for daily use=0.58(0.22 - 1.51 ). Persistent cannabis use was associated with a higher risk and shorter time until a subsequent MDD diagnosis. In addition, cannabis use frequency was predicted in the final model by 18 variables, cannabis abuse by two variables ( p < 0.001 ), and alcohol use by three variables. In the study population, cannabinoid use was significantly correlated with the onset of the problem... Although the relationship between cannabis use to the brain.."

The participants ( 60 - 75 yr of age ) were r and omly assigned to sedentary ( S ), WE and WL groups. The two groups were exercised for 12 weeks at 70 % of the age-predicted maximum heart rate ( HR ). The subjects were evaluated before and after the training period, and measurements of bodyweight, HR at rest, maximum aerobic power ( VO(2max ), and a feedback report. The exercise program consisted of a 10-minute warm-up and stretching, 25 minutes of endurance-type exercise ( walking and dancing, and 10 min of cool-down exercise. RESULTS After training, bodyweight was unchanged in both programs. The gait speed was increased significantly in both groups ( p=0.005 ) ; static balance, using the Unipedal Stance Test ( UST ).. The results showed that the participants were at risk ( FR < 10 inches ) and their physical functioning ( P < 0.05 ), with a significantly greater decrease in AG. The dynamic strength was significantly different in the 2 groups ( 3 % ), the static strength and dynamic strength were significantly different ( p<0.001 ), while the sit- and -reach test was increased. The muscle strength tests were considered the primary outcome, whereas the other neuromuscular tests, together with falls, were considered secondary outcomes. The AAG achieved the best results for physical functioning. The water- and aquatic exercise ( AE ) has been shown to be effective at improving physical functioning in this population. The aquatic exercise training program and the conservative approach ( AE. The study showed the aquatic exercise and aerobic exercise treatment of healthy older adults result in a decrease in physical functioning, however, the.A})."
26888713," BACKGROUND The common genetic variants in the fat mass and obesity-associated gene ( FTO ) gene may interact with dietary intakes in relation to obesity. We examined whether the best-associated variant on the FTO gene on changes in body weight and weight regain after 3 years and its modification by a r and omized nutritional intervention with a Mediterranean-style diet in a population of subjects at high cardiovascular risk. METHODS AND RESULTS We genotyped FTO rs9939609 in 738 overweight adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the basal visit, patients were r or omized to 1 of 4 diets varying in macronutrient contents for 2 years. We assessed the progress in fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) and weight loss by genotypes. At 6 months, participants with the risk-conferring CC genotype had greater decreases in insulin ( P=0.009 ), fasting plasma glucose, and triglyceride ( P = 0.007 ). The association was observed in participants who were genotyped by RT-PCR, followed by allelic discrimination. In contrast, serum levels of the satiety-enhancing hormone leptin were inversely linked to the number of FTO C risk alleles ( AA genotype, n=4 ; 8.5 % ).. The A allele was associated to a significantly higher increase in all the anthropometric variables examined at T0 independently from the study group ( intervention versus control ) ( p-values : all p<0.002 ). We did not observe association between FTO variant and the magnitude of weight loss in response to diet/lifestyle interventions.

21710185," This study investigated the effect of dietary change on infantile colic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a specific hypoallergenic diet ( group A ) with those of pharmacological treatment ( group B ). Non‐breastfed group A infants  received soy milk and if unresponsive, hydrolyzed milk formulas. The mothers of infants with colic, the cause of 10–20 % of all early paediatrician visits, were enrolled to the study.. A systematic review was conducted to examine whether dietary change provides the desired outcomes. Infants were r and omized to whey hydrolysate formula ( n = 23 ) or a st and ard formula. The primary end point was a reduction in cry/fuss duration of ≥25 % from baseline. The same procedure was repeated on day 10. The capsules contained either whey protein powder ( with Nutramigen added ) or placebo.. The infants' crying, fussing, sleeping, formula, intake, and sleeping times were measured for 0.5 and 3.0 hours before and after juice feeding. The study was double-blinded. Infants receiving the new formula had a significant decrease in colic episodes after 1 week ( 2.47±1.94 at day 7 vs 5.99 ±1.84 at the baseline ). Further analyses demonstrated that there were more clinical ly meaningful positive responses ( a change in crying by at least one third ) to cow milk, however, the difference between the infants receiving whey protein capsules and the control group was not significant. The difference between mean duration of total crying(hours/day ) and crying was found lower than other intervention groups...

15924510," The effectiveness of exercise therapy in patients with ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) was studied in two groups to evaluate the effectiveness of a back school compared with an exercise-only regimen. The primary treatment outcome was change in spinal mobility measured at 4 months by fingertip-to-floor distance. The research protocol consisted of a pretreatment evaluation, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [ UPDRS ] with subscales for mentation, activities of daily living [ ADL ], and motor function.  Current health status ( SF-12 ) was also assessed. RESULTS From primary care physicians, there was significant improvement in the UPDRS ADL and motor scores, but no change in mentation score. During the 6 months following physical rehabilitation, patients were similar in age, sex, smoking habits, and arteriographic pattern of disease. In the PTA group two patients had angioplasties that were technically unsuccessful and two other patients subsequently required surgery.. The outcome measures included the Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ), Brunnstrom stages of motor recovery, timed mobility tasks, and the Jebson h and evaluation. We also evaluated the level of depression, self-esteem, and socialization. The treated patients demonstrated an improvement of 6.6 points over the 3 mo of treatment, but this was not the case when patients were censored at 6, 9 and 12 months ( P less than 0.01 ). The results presented here are based on data collected 4 months following treatment. The improvement in performance appears to be related to early initiation of the rehabilitation program and to the presence of other factors. The rehabilitation program is effective in terms of improving the musculoskeletal, nervous, and cardiovascular systems."
30647466," BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to assess the effects of 5 mg melatonin before sleep in patients with coronary artery disease ( CAD ) and with an abnormal circadian pattern of blood pressure ( BP ) on changes in circadian BP profile and heart rate variability ( HRV ). Sixty patients with CAD, nondippers aged 48–80 years ( male 75 % ), were included. In addition to previous treatment, they were r and omized to a fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide or placebo. After 90 days, a second 24-hour BP monitoring was carried out. Each patient had two sessions to evaluate the lipid profile and renal function in type 2 DM patients poorly controlled with metformin.  A placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was performed in which 46 type II diabetic patients were selected and allocated into three groups. The treatment did not affect heart rate. The day – night amplitudes of the rhythms in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were increased by 15 % and 25 %, respectively. A single dose of melatonin had no effect on blood pressure. Repeated ( but not acute ) melatonin also improved sleep. The reduction in nocturnal systolic BP was significantly greater with melatonin than with placebo. Of interest, no agreement between the two tools was evident in their final grade assigned to each study.. The present study suggests that support of circadian pacemaker function may provide a new strategy in treating patients with metabolic disorders."
25443649," BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The efficacy of two home-based exercise programs on alleviating fatigue and improving functional capacity in breast cancer survivors. We evaluated the relative merits of aerobic and resistance exercise in blunting these effects. A r and omized controlled clinical trial was performed. We conducted the efficacy of physiotherapy treatment of shoulder function, pain and quality of life in patients who have undergone breast cancer surgery and axillary lymph node dissection. Methods and Results : Women ( N = 14,811 ), aged 20 to 83 yr with no prior breast cancer history, received a preventive medical examination at the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, Texas, between 1970 and 2001. Mortality surveillance was completed through December 31, 2003. Treadmill exercise was quantified as maximal treadmill exercise test duration and was significantly greater than bike Vo2peak, trunk curl endurance, and leg strength. There were 555 deaths ( 26 % ) and 194 ( 9 % ) transplants during a median follow-up of 3.5 years. Peak & OV0312;o2 was a predictor of mortality irrespective of β-blocker use. Means, st and ard deviations, and 95 % confidence intervals for each measurement were calculated for each cohort. RESULTS The 6MW, TUG, CGS, and FGS measurements showed high test-retest reliability ( ICC [2,1]=.95-.97 ). Mean test scores showed a trend of improvement in shoulder mobility and had significantly less pain than the control group. Quality of life improved significantly, however, h and grip strength and arm volume did not alter significantly. Conclusion Physiotherapy reduces pain and improves shoulder function for the majority of women diagnosed with breast cancer.."
30516592," Background Appendectomy has been the treatment of choice for acute appendicitis. The aim of this r and omized trial was to compare the effectiveness of nonoperative management with appendectomy, but this alternative has never before been tried in a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Methods : A national survey of all consultant general surgeons evaluating their practice s was performed. Reasons for changed practice s, clinical ( C‐reactive protein [ CRP ] < 50 ), and radiological features ( diameter > 6 mm ). All patients were treated with intravenous amoxicillin and clavulanic acid ( 100 mg/kg/day ) for 2 days to 6 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study was the success of treatment. All children in the surgery group had histopathologically confirmed appendicitisis. The failure to respond to therapy and the incidence of recurrence were assessed. There were 107 enrolled patients with the mean age of 11.8 ± 0.6 years. Of these patients, 97 ( 91 % ) were discharged with no surgery. Four other patients required surgery. The remaining 10 patients underwent surgery because of clinical aggravation. The range across highest and lowest follow-up was 3495 days ( range 2–3497 ) for the entire group. The overall success rate of appendectomy was 92 %. The median age was 9 years ( SD=1.0d ), the median duration of hospital stay was 9 days. The majority ( > 95 % ) of patients ( n = 5 ) had no recurrence. The conservative management of uncomplicated appendicosis with antibiotics can be successful for patients who wish to avoid surgery. This pilot trial suggests that nonoperative management of acute appendis through antibiotics alone is feasible and safe...

26103030," Objective : To determine the effect of a tetrahydrocannabinol ( CBME ), a nonopioid analgesic endocannabinoid system modulator, in patients with chronic pain. Methods : We conducted a placebo-controlled, crossover trial involving adult patients with multiple sclerosis and spasticity. We recruited 160 patients with cancer pain, who experienced inadequate analgesia despite chronic opioid dosing, and placebo. For these patients, we performed a double-blind, single-dose, double-masked, placebo -controlled, parallel-group trial. The primary outcome was change in the Ashworth spasticity scale. Secondary outcomes were the Rivermead Mobility Index, timed 10 metre walk, UK Neurological Disability Score, postal Barthel Index, and a series of nine category rating scales. Following the main study, patients were invited to continue medication, double blinded, for up to12 months. The mean number of vomiting episodes in cycle 1 was 4.76 for N and 12.95 for D ( P<0.02 ). The corresponding values for the primary outcome measure were 4.27 and 7.69 ( P>0.10 ), and for cycles 1 and 2 combined, 4.53 for P < 0.01 ). In the Phase II trial, titrated dronabinol contributed to significant relief of pain, reduced pain bothersomeness, and increased satisfaction compared with placebo. There was no change from baseline in median dose of opioid background medication or adverse events.. The number of patients with adverse events was higher during active treatment... : Cannabis and cannabinoid drugs are widely used to treat disease or alleviate symptoms, but their efficacy for specific indications is not clear."
31833645," OBJECTIVE To examine, using an Ecological Systems Theoretical framework, relationships between weight status and child, parent and community characteristics and risk factors among preschool children. Aims : As part of the Ballabeina study, 600 r and omly selected preschoolers ( mean age 5.1 ± 0.6 years ; 50.2 % girls ) were analyzed. Body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance, aerobic fitness by the 20-meter shuttle run test, and physical activity by accelerometers. Eating habits, media use, and SC participation were assessed by question naires. RESULTS Overweight children ( Swiss national percentiles ) and children not participating in SC had both lower aerobic fitness and higher % body fat compared to their respective counterparts ( all p ≤ 0.028 ). In addition, children that participated in SC were less physically active, had more media use ( MVPA ) and SB.. The intervention had positive, significant effects on percentage BMI -for-age and percentage body fat for target children and weight, and in eating habits. Conclusion : Aerobic fitness differs both according to weight status than preschoolers with lower BMI z scores and high object control scores ( PA = 15.04 min/h and 13.54 min , respectively ). The results reported here showed that the association between accelerometer-derived PA and time sedentary than those living with two parents.. However, for some characteristics, differences in older children have been reported. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm when these characteristics begin to differ, what effects these differences have on behaviour and weight-status, and therefore when targeted treatment should be provided during a child's development. A systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted to examine associations between  physical activity ( PA ) and adiposity in young children."
29178962," This study represents a long-term effort to find optimal techniques for evaluating outcome in patients who have undergone total joint arthroplasty. The Impact of Weight on  Quality of Life question naire ( IWQOL ) was the first self-report instrument specifically developed to assess the effect of obesity on quality of life. Although the IW QOL has demonstrated excellent psychometric properties, its length ( 74 items ) makes it somewhat cumbersome as an outcome measure in clinical research. This report describes the development of a 31-item version of the UWQOL ( iWQOL-Lite ). RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES IWQoLs from 996 obese patients and controls were used to develop the OWQOL. Response values ( i.e., changes within patients ) were calculated on four scales : global health, pain, mobility. The utility of effect sizes is demonstrated from four different perspectives using three health status data sets derived from arthritis population s administered the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales ( AIMS ). The first perspective shows how general and instrument-specific benchmarks can be developed and how they can be used the translate the meaning of clinical change. The second perspective shows the reliability of these indices were constructed using a jackknife procedure, and significance tests were performed by pairing selected indices. Finally, the study projected sample sizes required to compare a new therapy, using each response. These statistical tools facilitated comparisons among instruments and may prove useful in other setting BACKGROUND: Background Recent systematic review s have identified that current patient-reported outcome instruments have content limitations when to measure change after bariatric surgery."
29635250," Background : As genetic testing for type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM )  increases, it is unclear whether this information is helpful for patients. Methods : This study aimed to determine the impact of informing obese people about the genetic etiology of being overweight.. We conducted an online survey of DTC customers of 23 and Me, deCODEme, and Navigenics to begin to address these questions.. Participants were r and omized to either genetic test results ( CR+G ; N = 303 ) or control group ( N = 298 ). The main outcome measures were perceptions of control over hypercholesterolemia, adherence to cholesterol‐lowering medication, diet, physical activity, and smoking.. The primary endpoint was the incidence of quit attempts. Results : Participants who tested severely AAT deficient were significantly more likely to report a 24-hr quit attempt ( 59 % ) than were those who were normal ( 26 % ). A brief intervention was used to compare changes in dietary supplement use than did those receiving no treatment. Upon completion of the study, EPA and DHA intake increased significantly ( p = 1.0 × 10−4 ). Lower-risk results were assessed by the odds ratio ( OR ) of smoking cessation for the participants with inadequate PA, by including an interaction term in the model : disclosure ( yes/no ) × FTO risk ( P = 0.87 ). There were no significant differences between APOE epsilon4 + and r/ n, the quality of genetic interventions.

26053004," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of a telephonic and a print intervention on type 2 diabetes mellitus. We studied the efficacy of a consultation-based intervention to support adherence to anti-diabetic medications. Setting This study was conducted at the Training and Community Health Centre of the College of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Participants ( N = 526 ) had an A1C ≥7.5 % and were prescribed one or more oral agents. The peer support intervention ran over a two year period and contained four elements : the recruitment and training of peer supporters, nine group meetings led by peer supporters in participant ’s own general practice, and a retention plan for the peer supporters. Main outcome measures HbA1c, exercise frequency, and self-reported diabetes. Results Mean values of fasting glycaemia in the intervention group were significantly reduced than did the controls. All practice s and 85 % ( 337 ) of patients were followed up. At three successive months, the short message service group that received interventions was significantly greater than the control group. The telephone group had mean ± SE decline in HbA1C ( 6.9 of 7 d, with all medicines taken as prescribed ; p = 0.3 ). Medical regimen discrepancies were identified in 44 % of intervention patients, involving 45 doses of medicines. At 3-month follow-up, 60 % of patients with diabetes mellitus ( T2D ). A range of interventions have been developed to promote anti-diabetes medication adherence. However, there has been very little focus on the characteristics of these interventions and how effectively they address factors that predict non-adherence."
31399113," INTRODUCTION Dental caries, specifically decalcified white-spot lesions ( WSL ) are a frequent side-effect of orthodontic treatment. The effect of local fluoridation on post-orthodontic WSL is however inconclusive. Objective : To test the null-hypothesis that there is no significant difference in enamel decalcification or cavitation incidence adjacent to and beneath bracket bases between two  lingual multi-bracket ( MB ) appliances  that are different in terms of design, material composition, and manufacturing technology ( group A : WIN, DW-LingualSystems ; group B : Incognito, 3M-Unitek ). The incidence of patients who developed at least 1 new WSL during treatment was 72.9 %, and this incidence was 2.3 % for cavitated lesions. In the treatment group, white spot lesion infiltration of the anterior teeth was performed with low-viscosity light-cured resin after enamel conditioning with a 15 % HCl gel.  Color and lightness of  the white spot lesions and the sound adjacent enamel were assessed with a spectrophotometer before infiltration and after 1 day, 1 week, 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.. When measured using quantitative light-induced fluorescence ( QLF ), the increase in integrated fluorescence loss was 10.6 times higher buccally than lingually. We conclude that lingual brackets make a difference when caries lesion incidence is concerned.. The overall low incidences of enamel cavitations (. ) in esthetically relevant incisor and canine areas impair dentofacial esthetics, and preventive dentistry treatment is definitely required in case of labial or lingual MB interventions. The incidences of lingual and tooth cavitations. Although the incidence of treatment and time duration had globally a highly significant influence on the esthetic outcome, lingual WSL and cavitation following lingual AB treatment have been reported to be distinctively decreased compared to labial MB treatment..

We assessed the role of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. The multicenter trial comparing the effects of 2 levels of blood pressure ( BP ) control and 3 antihypertensive drug classes on glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ). We therefore performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to clarify these differences. The primary end point was a composite of  the time to myocardial infa rct ion, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, and mortality. The patients were enrolled at 536 health centres in Sweden and Finl and. Patients aged 25 - 66 years with a measured diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or more on two occasions were followed up for 3 to 6.4 years. The trial was a two-by-two factorial study evaluating both ramipril and placebo. The incidence of CV events during the study period was 20.4/1000person-years. After a median follow-up time of 6.9 months, the primary end points had occurred in 783 patients ( 14.0 percent ), they experienced the greatest absolute benefit from treatment with either a beta-blocker ( metoprolol 50 - 200 mg/d ; n = 441 ), or a combined treatment. In the subgroup of patients with the lowest blood pressure, there was no difference in the mortality rate ( 2.4 % vs. 3.5 % ), hematuria in 4.6 % ( 95 % CI : 3.8 % to 5.4 ), and the mean risk of death from any cause.

We retrospectively examined whether treatment-resistant depression and anxiety disorder patients responded to and tolerated augmentation with the atypical antipsychotic, aripiprazole. This cross-sectional study of 186 patients with DSM-IV GAD, who continued to experience anxiety disorders ( with no or mild agoraphobia ) who were participating in the Multicenter Collaborative Treatment Study of Panic Disorder. This study assessed aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy to SSRIs for patients with persistent anxiety symptoms after an adequate ( or maximally tolerated ) dose of typical pharmacotherapy. RESULTS Twenty-four of 46 patients were r and omized to aripiprazole. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 4 endpoint in Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety ( HAM-A ), the Sheehan Panic Anxiety Scale-Patient ( SPAS-P ), and the Clinical Global Impression scale ( CGI ). There was a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms at the endpoint. At 3 weeks, phenetiapine and placebo were associated with significantly greater than that of placebo ( p < 0.05 ) and for each disorder-specific primary outcome measure - the Panic Disorder Severity Scale ( P =.034 ) and CGI. The results suggest that aripiprazole may be effective as an augmentation for individuals with persistent depressive and anxiety disorders despite initial SSRI treatment. Because this is a retrospective case review, there is interest in treatment options such as second-generation antipsychotics. BACKGROUND Anxiety disorders are common and disabling conditions, with a lifetime prevalence of 17 % of the general population. Due to high rates of treatment resistance, they may be a useful treatment option for people with anxiety disorders..

We sought to address this issue by providing estimates of the crude and age-specific prevalence and incidence rates of and rogen deficiency in a r and omly sample d population -based cohort of middle-aged and older men. RESULTS : Among those without prevalent cancer or cardiovascular disease, total testosterone, and the Yesavage's Geriatric Depression Scale were available for 1822 men... Results. In total, 375 men with a mean age of 59.9 years ( 9.2 ± SD ) entered this study.. The median difference between bivariate and univariate methods for the relation of sex steroids to falls. The operational definition of low testosterone was 0.8%/yr of age.. Using a pretest probability of 50 %, the median difference in posterior probability was 2.5 % ( interquartile range : 2.2 - 3.2 %, overall range : 0 - 11 % ).. For sparse data, there were approximately 2.4 million 40- to 69-yr-old U.S. males with androgen deficiency. The crude incidence rate of testosterone decreased in the hypogonadal group ( 94.4 % ) as compared to 155/254 ( 61.0 % ), whereas the investigated variety of lifestyle factors did not show a significant difference ( p = 0.171 ). To investigate risk factors that might predict hypogonadism in older men by extrapolating from the defined clinical entity of hypogonadism found in younger men.

The study was conducted to the extent to which Se supplementation in the patients with Graves'disease. The patients were divided into two groups : Se supplementation ( n = 13 ), which initially received 200 μg sodium selenite ( Se), and placebo. The outcome measure was serum TSH, the ratio of TSH to free triiodothyronine ( FT3 ),. Serum thyrotropin ( TSH ), free thyroxine ( FT4 ) and free thyroxin ( TPO )) were measured in all patients at baseline, 3 and 6 months. In the overall cohort, patients r and omized to Se supplementation were compared with the placebo group. Serum Se level was not statistically different between the 2 groups at baseline.. Serum TSH, free T4 ( FT6 ), TPOAb, after 3 months ( p = 0.004 ). The same was observed for seven of eight SF-36 scales. Serum malondialdehyde, that is, anti-thyroid drug treatment, TPO therapy. The serum Se supplementation had no more effect than placebo in decreasing TPO-Ab concentration or the prevalence of TPO‐Ab positivity. The mean TSH and FT4 concentrations were significantly lower in group S1 compared to S0. The percentage of patients with TSH, FT6, and TPOAb decreased significantly in both groups at 6 months ( P < 0.001 ).. The results of this study suggest that supplementation with Se supplementation could improve the quality of life, but not the clinical outcomes of SLE, than the control group.

30544134," BACKGROUND Contact force ( CF ) ) is a critical determinant of technical and clinical success of radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA ). We assessed the impact of direct catheter force measurement on acute procedural parameters and outcome of AF ablation. We analyzed procedural characteristics and predictors of clinical success in patients undergoing ablation of AF. Methods A total of 106 patients ( 28 male ) with paroxysmal AF and were treated with a target CF of 20 g ( CF group ), and CF was displayed in group B ( 35 patients ). In group B, optimal CF was defined as mean CF between 10 and 39 g, and operators attempted to acquire points and ablate within this range. Patients undergoing AF ablation with the SmartTouch catheter and the ACL system ( SmartTouch group ). Primary endpoints were procedural time, absorbed dose ( Air Kerma in mGy ).. Results Mean average CF was significantly lower in the CF group ( 64 % vs 36 %, P = 0.01 ) and shorter fluoroscopy times ( 41 % reduction, P < 0.001 ). The last 25 patients from each group underwent analysis of all VisiTags ™ for ablation duration, CF, Force‐Time Integral, and impedance drop. The primary outcome is time to first documented AF recurrence on implantable loop recorder. By Kaplan-Meier analyses, the total AF ablation time was significantly reduced from 28.5 ± 11.0 to 19.9 ± 9.3 minutes ( P =.003 ). There were significant site-dependent CF differences between groups. PVI was achieved in all patients in both groups. Linear ablations including cavo-tricuspid isthmus and or roof line ablation were not different between groups. CONCLUSIONS The use of contact force sensing technology in atrial fibrillation ( AF ) ablation, r and omized data suggests lack of improvement in clinical outcomes."
31571503," Background : Impaired postural stability is associated with an increase in risk of falls in people with Parkinson disease ( PD ). A valid mobility test, the Four Square Step Test ( FSST ), has not been widely investigated. Objective The purpose of this study was to compare the validity of the Nintendo Wii ® balance board as a measurement tool for the assessment of postural stability in individuals with PD. Methods : Twenty individuals with Parkinson ’s disease were tested on medications. Measures of activity included the  comfortable and fast 10-m walk tests ( CWT, FWT ), 6-min walk test ( 6MWT ), and Timed “ Up & Go ” Test ( TUG ).. Results : Analysis of individual tests revealed broad variations in validity indices, whereas the collective interpretation of multiple tests improved sensitivity and negative likelihood ratios. Conclusion : Concurrent validity was demonstrated to be excellent across balance tasks ( area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve [ AUC ], 0.83 ) to 5.8 ( BESTest ). The percentage MDC ( MDC% ) was calculated as the sum of scores for each test. The study sample was tested twice by the same raters, with 1 week between tests. Test-retest reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICCs ). Minimal detectable change was calculated between those with PD and older adults.. The test-retest validity was high. The composite score of PD was above.90 in the BBS, ABC Scale, TUG, FRT, and S&E ADL Scale rating (.55, P <.005 ). The MDC95 values for those functional tests were both significantly ( P ≤.002 ) correlated with all other measures of balance and falls risk prediction in people who had PD."

17414146," BACKGROUND Iron deficiency anemia is the most prevalent nutrition problem in young children. One possible strategy to prevent iron deficiency anemia in this population group was to evaluate the effects of iron supplementation on hemoglobin ( Hb ), serum ferritin ( SF ), and the prevalence of anemia.. The study was designed to determine whether iron supplementation in anemic children would improve their response to the iron or placebo. RESULTS : Hematological, anthropometric, and morbidity data were collected before and after the intervention. The children were r and omly assigned to either 20 mg Fe, 20 mg Zn, both iron and zinc, or a placebo. The average increase in Hb was not significantly different between the daily ( mean + /- SD ; 6.5 - 9.8 g/L ) and weekly ( 5.7 - 13.57 ).. In the dual-fortified salt group, the mean body weight by 0.6 kg compared with 0.2 kg for placebo ( P < 0.05 ). At 40 weeks, there was no differential effect per iron tablet between weekly and daily regimens. A 12-wk daily regimen ( 68 % compliance ) was significantly better after iron supplementation than did the weekly regimen ( 104 % compliance ).. The first 20 tablets consumed produced the greatest improvements in the Hb, than the placebo group."

20429925," OBJECTIVES This prospect i ve study was conducted to determine the influence of 6 positions of the computer mouse on the work table on posture, muscular load, and perceived exertion. The intervention was in 3 parts : workstation re design ( including advanced ergonomic chairs, motorized adjustable workstations, and lack of forearm and wrist support ). The participants were asked to complete question naires on symptoms, job tasks, and psychosocial and work organization conditions. After the intervention, statistically significant reductions in physical signs ( trigger points, neck and shoulder mobility ), subjective reports of intensity and frequency of musculoskeletal pain, and subjective reports  of visual problems were observed. The results showed that the majority of participants reported no symptoms. The majority of respondents reported no pain. The study showed a significant reduction in the neck, shoulder and forearm pain at follow-up compared to after intervention. The  time pressure and verbal provocation  ( stress situation ) were associated with increased physiological and psychological reactions compared with the two control situations. The most common N/S MSD was the wrist. The number of hours worked per week was associated with an association between  computer work and neck and upper extremity disorders ( except carpal tunnel syndrome )."
30031025," BACKGROUND Antidepressant drugs such as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ), have both been shown to have antidepressant effects in the treatment of depression. The authors investigated whether this effect is apparent in depressed patients early in treatment, prior to changes in mood and symptoms. METHOD In the present study, we investigated the effects of short-term SSRI treatment in healthy volunteers on the neural response to fearful faces, the authors examined the effect of a single 4-mg dose of the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, citalopram, on emotional processing.. Thirty-three depressed patients were recruited through primary care clinics and the community and matched to 31 healthy comparison subjects. Three hours after dosing, participants were given a battery of emotional processing tasks comprising facial expression recognition, emotional categorization, and memory. The primary outcome was symptom remission, defined by a total score of 7 or less at the end of treatment. However, this response was normalised in patients receiving 7 days treatment with escitalopram. There was no significant difference in clinical depression ratings at 7 days between the escitalopram and placebo-treated patients. Conclusion : Despite the widespread use of antidepressants in clinical practice, there was no clear evidence that citalopram, unlike other antidepressants, reduces the processing of negative facial expressions. The treatment response in patients who received a single dose of citalopram, despite the absence of changes in subjective ratings of mood or anxiety. These results suggest that early changes in measures of cognition can predict response in individuals with MDD."
31013312," Background : Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is a major health problem that is associated with increased oxidative stress, and this beneficial effect on the pharmacokinetics of curcumin, there is a paucity of effective treatments to be used as the second line for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of curcumin.. : A 12-week r and omized double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted. Patients with T2DM on oral hypoglycemic agents with HbA1C > 7.0 % were randomized and omly assigned to receive curcumin ( 300 mg/day ) or placebo ( n = 58 ) for 8 weeks. Serum adiponectin and leptin concentrations were determined before and after intervention. The primary outcome was change in glycaemic control as evidence d by fasting blood glucose ( FBG ), post-pr and ial plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ). Other measures included change in fasting insulin, insulin resistance and sensitivity, lipids, C-reactive protein ( CRP ), triglycerides ( TG ), and insulin resistance index ( HOMA-IR ). The study revealed that curcumin supplementation was associated with a reduction in serum levels of total cholesterol ( P < 0.001 ), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDLC ), insulin, and lipid profile. At the end of the study, curcumin was found to improve the glycemic control. In addition, the lipid parameters in the treatment group ( 7 vs 1, p = 0.043 ). In conclusion, short-term curcumin supplementation could be administered safely and effectively to patients with prediabetes and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T2DM )."
25887465," BACKGROUND : To identify risk factors for postherpetic neuralgia ( PHN ). We compared the effects of three different analgesia techniques ( transversus abdominis plane, double-blinded, and placebo ) on the control of acute and chronic pain. We used a randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative pain. The secondary outcomes were the efficacy of the following: postoperative pain and the use of pregabalin. The patients were r and omly assigned to groups that received pregabalin 150 mg or placebo.. Postoperative analgesia was maintained with epidural PCA, the placebo group and after an additional 6 months were collected. A monthly surveillance for the whole year showed a mean of 4.5 “ painful months ” in the study group versus 7.3 and 7.4 months in those who received placebo. The main outcomes studied were postoperative pain scores, 24-hour opioid requirements, and pain scores. The incidence of pain was significantly lower in this group ( n = 47 ) than the other groups. The mean ( SD ) of pain scores were 0.3 ( 0.48–3.26 ). The incidence rate of pain decreased significantly more ( 39 % ) in  the gabapentin group compared with the baseline group ( P < 0.05 ). The number of patients with an initially high fear-avoidance beliefs score who received the intervention was similar between the 2 groups.. The average pain scores at rest, with passive movement, or with weight bearing were similar in both groups at 3 months. The results of our study suggest that although certain risk factors can identify individuals who are most likely to develop chronic pain, few interventions to prevent chronic pain have been identified. We present research design considerations for clinical trials investigating the prevention of chronic pain after surgery..A/-+R90) }).,-."
27820060," BACKGROUND The study was performed to examine the effectiveness of a nurse-managed intervention for patients with coronary artery disease ( CAD ). A pre-test-post-test quasi-experimental design was used. Subjects who smoked prior to admission to hospital were included in the study. The intervention group received the intervention, the control group received usual care, and the group received a brief intervention, which consisted of touchscreen computer-assisted assessment to provide immediate feedback on key barriers to dietary self-management, and goal setting and problem-solving counseling for patients. RESULTS : Of the 607 patients screened, 105 men and 53 women met inclusion criteria and were r and omized into a control group  or an intervention group ( n = 87 ). The study revealed that the brief intervention produced greater improvements than usual care on a number of measures of dietary behavior, a self-help pamphlet, and a list of community re sources. The patients were given an 18-page manual that emphasized how to identify and cope with high-risk situations.. The results suggest that, for both groups there is strong evidence that participation in traditional cardiac rehabilitation programs remains low.. Various models of cardiac rehabilitation have been implemented including the use of brief structured interventions to enable modification of coronary risk factors. Although results supported the usefulness of the program, the duration of intervention was significantly greater than the usual care group. The quality of life of patients with cardiac rehabilitation after a coronary event was well been established. The average percent diameter stenosis at baseline decreased 1.75 absolute percentage points after 1 year ( a 4.5 % relative improvement ) and by 3.1 % after 6 months. The physical and psychosocial benefits of participation in cardiac rehabilitation program have well been documented. The benefits of rehabilitation in this study compared with the conventional rehabilitation program in a single center with a high prevalence of cardiac diseaseAVC+.})."

A question naire distributed to 148 general practitioners presented results of a clinical trial where a reduction of cardiac events and an increase of mortality was reported. Results were shown in a double-blind, placebo-controlled and crossover fashion on both spontaneous ongoing pain and allodynia in 44 patients with chronic pain. The benefit of the drug was expressed in terms of NNT and was r and omly set at 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400. The data consisted of 10 commonly used clinical and laboratory variables measured before and after a period of treatment. The same data were presented in two formats on two separate occasions. The patient data format was a collection of typed sheets attributing each set of results to an individual patient. The clinical trials "" were each rated on an 11-point scale, from treatment "" harmful "" to "" very effective. "" RESULTS Respondents'ratings of effectiveness varied with the end point. The mean difference in the VAS pain score was defined as the mean difference between current and preceding scores when the subject reported “ a little worse ” or ‘ a little better ” pain... Although some statistically significant differences emerged, the individual doctors'judgements between the formats were often suboptimal, impeding clinical interpretation and decision making."
11034690," The effects of L-carnitine supplementation on fat and glucose metabolism and carnitine balance were studied in 12 preterm neonates receiving full or partial parenteral nutrition ( PN ) for 5 to 21 days. The gestational age ranged from 27 to 32 weeks and the birth weight from 790 to 2090 g. The neonates were assigned at r and om to receive either L‐carnitinine 10 mg/kg ( n=6 ) or saline ( n =6 ). In the carnitina group, increased concentrations in plasma of total and free carnitines were observed. Less than 50 % of the given dose was recovered in urine. In contrast the placebo group no changes in the total plasma carnitin concentration were seen. In all neonates plasma triglycerides, free fatty acids, glycerol, alanine, 3‐hydroxybutyrate ( BOB ), glucose and lactate were measured at predetermined intervals. On the sixth day of treatment the means of both free and total parenma carnitinine concentrations increased significantly, whereas they tended to decrease in those of those in their Intralipid ® group. In conclusion, the study provides evidence that premature infants of less than 34 weeks'gestation requiring treatment with the lipid. The study suggests that the fatty acid oxidation is impaired, thus reducing the nutritional quality. There was no significant difference between theplacebo and carnitrine supplemented groups in growth rate, as assessed by weight, length, skinfold thickness and head circumference measurements. Both breast milk and infant formulas contain carnitinate. The secondary aims are to determine the effect on lipid tolerance and ketogenesis."

21412147," OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis in cardiac operations, compared to other antimicrobial agents for  surgical site infections and remote infections. The results were quite similar in both groups, the number of participants has grown dramatically, patient acuity has increased, and overall outcomes have consistently improved. The efficacy of ceftriaxone was compared with that of other antibiotics in the perioperative prophylaxis of local ( surgical wound ) and remote ( RTIs and UTIs ) infections. We performed a multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, with cefazolin. The analysis was based on a 2 × 2 contingency table with classification by treatment and number of infections obtained from individual studies. The main exposure was the duration of  ABP , and main outcomes were the adjusted rate of SSI and the isolation of cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae and vancomycin-resistant enterococci ( acquired antibiotic resistance ). RESULTS The optimal duration of antibiotic prophylaxis for adults undergoing cardiac surgery is unknown and guideline recommendations are inconsistent.. Single-dose ceftriaxone prophylaxis is as effective as cefuroxime given for 48 hours postoperatively. A single dose of ceftriaxone is also effective than multiple doses of ceftriaxone. The proportion of patients who were given a prophylactic antimicrobial agent  that was consistent with currently published guidelines..

16856043," In a double-blind clinical trial, the authors examined the relationship between steady-state haloperidol  blood levels and clinical response in patients with acute psychotic mania.. The study was based on : --Howard's experiences : more than half of his chronic psychotic patients were able to leave the State Hospital because of the multimodal treatment with high individualized doses of haloperidol..  The patients were treated at r and omly assigned to either haloperidol or placebo. The main objectives in treating mania are to control dangerous behaviour, reduce suicide, produce appropriate acute sedation and shorten the episode of mood disturbance.. RESULTS : Among different drugs, haloperidol was found to significantly correlate with clinical response, there were no differences among the three doses. The authors were unable to statistically distinguish between haloperidol and placebo or the haloperidol -- lithium combination.  Haloperidol blood levels were significantly greater in patients who were nonresponsive to placebo or other active drugs... We conclude that either monotherapy or add-on treatment can be beneficial but that haloperidol is more effective than placebo.. In the acute phase, haloperidol is superior to other drugs, but it has a troublesome side effect profile. The greatest rate of improvement for both drug regimens occurred over the first 3 full days of treatment. The bipolar group was compared with the control group and to the unipolar depression subgroup."

29510813," BACKGROUND The Internet has potential as a medium for health behavior change programs, but no controlled studies have yet evaluated the impact of a fully automated physical activity intervention for bipolar disorder. The methods used to assess and report patients'results must consequently be indicated a priori in the design of the clinical experimentation. AIM The study aimed to explore the feasibility, acceptability and impact of an online mindfulness-based intervention targeting mood symptoms. The study was a randomized controlled trial with 82 patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder who completed a four-session psychoeducational intervention and were assigned to the intervention. The treatment was predominantly psycho-educational with cognitive behavioral therapy optional elements. The outcome measures were : self-reported primary diagnosis of BD, six or more episodes of bipolar disorder, and mean body mass index. The intervention was assessed at baseline, 6 weeks ( mid-point ), 12 weeks ( post-treatment ), and 24 weeks ( follow up ). The primary outcome was the occurrence of relapse, while secondary outcomes were depression, anxiety, and stress measured on the DASS scales. RESULTS : The intervention group showed significantly greater than the control group for depressive and manic symptoms, with the latter group showing greater adherence. The outcomes were significant differences between the active and control treatment groups ( Cohen׳s d for both were d=0.48 ). Participants were 1:1:1 individually r and omised, to usual care or to one of two active interventions. The qualitative analysis ( Braun & Clarke, 2006 ) showed that the treatment group had more sustained depressive symptoms ( eB = 1.17, 95 % CI : 1.15 - 1.19, p < 0.001 ).

30231505," BACKGROUND. The value of probiotics for primary prevention is controversial. Published trials vary considerably in study design and the applied probiotics, thereby limiting comparability of the results. We repeated the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood ( ISAAC ) at least 5 years after Phase One, to examine changes in the prevalence of symptoms of these disorders. METHODS : In the ISAAC Phase Three study, between 2002 and 2003, we did a  cross-sectional question naire survey of 193,404 children aged 6 - 7 years from 66 centres in 37 countries, and 304,679 children aged 13 - 14 years from 106 centres in 56 countries, chosen from a r and om sample of schools in a defined geographical area. We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) approach to develop recommendations. We found that the risk of developing atopic eczema during the first 2 years of life in infants whose mothers received  probiotics. The primary end point was the occurrence of atopic dermatitis at the age of 2 years. Secondary outcomes were severity of atopic eczema, recurrent episodes of wheezing bronchitis, and allergic sensitization.. The overall incidence of eczema was a clear risk factor for atopic eczema in this context, the infants most likely to benefit from these products take into account the dose, formulation, bacterial species, and target population. That all stakeholders including laboratories, government regulatory authorities, and scientistsbe prepared to address this important topic is reassuring. The divergent trends in prevalence of signs and symptoms of allergic diseases form the basis for further research into the efficacy of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ( LGG ) supplementation prenatally and /or postnatally for the primary prevention of eczema."

The aims of this study were to a ) establish normative values of VO(2 max ), to assess the effects of workplace training, and to compare them with a control group. The study was conducted with a total of 107 female hospital employees aged 25–63 years. The intervention group received 1 h supervised high-intensity aerobic exercise training ( 1 ), 3 WS : three 20-min supervised sessions/week, three times a week. The control group was told to continue their ordinary activity. The main outcome measures were aerobic fitness ( UKK, walking test ), health-related quality of life, and musculoskeletal health. Results There were no baseline differences between groups. CRF assessed as VO2max in absolute values and relative to body weight was ( p = 0.001 ). Complete sickness absence data were collected from a community register for two comparable 7-month periods. There were high, medium, and low responders in all age groups, both sexes, both races, and all levels of initial fitness.. Age, sex, race, and initial fitness were effective in improving physical fitness and thus health. However, there is no current systematic review available that provides high-level evidence regarding the impacts of PET on physical fitness in the workforce. To quantify sex-, age-, and occupation type-specific effects of PET that could maximize physical fitness.

29372708," Aim : This study evaluated the retention rate and caries protection of a flowable composite resin as an intermediate material between composite resin and dental substrates. The study was design ed to explore this approach further by determining whether there is a difference in retention rates on sound or carious tooth surfaces sealed for the first time and a sealant ( Concise ). This study observed 205 permanent molars with small carious cavities less than 1.5 mm in width, and were sealed with a hydrophilic sealant, while those in Groups 2 and 5 had dry and wet occlusal surfaces. The complete retention was 30 out of 31 examined teeth for Group B, and 71 of 31 were treated with flowable compomer in both cavities and caries-free fissures. In addition, Streptococcus mutans counts were assessed at baseline, 1 day, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after sealant application. Data were analyzed by Fisher exact, chi-square and ANOVA tests. RESULTS : There was no significant difference in dye penetration was found between the control and the experimental groups. The two main types of sealants were not significantly different in relation to caries-preventive effects. The mean retention rate of the two groups was not statistically significant. The retention rates were 84 % and 75 % at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively.

27116227," BACKGROUND Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with type 2 diabetes and related metabolic risks. Due to contradictory findings from intervention trials, we investigated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on insulin sensitivity, endothelial function, inflammation, oxidative stress, and the development of diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 100 male volunteers aged > or = 35 years old with overweight/obese, which is associated with cardiometabolic risk. This systematic review examines the association between oral vitamin D ( VD ) supplementation and circulating inflammatory biomarkers and glycemic outcomes from r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) of overweight and /or obese adults. The vitamin D-deficient group received 300,000 IU i m monthly for 12 weeks. The following parameters were evaluated before and after treatment : vitamin D metabolites, leptin, insulin resistance, and blood pressures..  Cardiovascular events were defined as death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infa rct... Serum TNF-alpha, sTNFR-2 ( ELISA ) and fasting C-peptide ( RIA ). RESULTS Of the 12 markers measured, hs-CRP was the strongest univariate predictor of the risk of death in the vitamin D group ( −2.8 ± 1.3 vs.-1.8±1.3 kg ; P=0.02 ). There were no differences between the placebo and vitamin D groups regarding fasting plasma glucose, 2-h glucose, or insulin secretion and sensitivity, and between serum 25OHD and CRP. The calcium + D group also exhibited greater decrease in visceral fat mass and visceral fat area ( P<0.05 ).. The trial indicates that Vitamin D supplementation in overweight and obese adults during resistance training induced an early improvement in insulin sensitivity ( P <.01 ). Vitamin D deficiency increases inflammation, and both groups had a significant reduction in plasma vitamin D levels ( P = 0.05 and.-).A.  "
30338526," BACKGROUND. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a whey hydrolyzed formula ( NAN H.A. ) on the development of type 1 diabetes in infants. The infants were recommended breastfeeding and /or hypoallergenic formula ( CM ), cow-milk formula ( CMF ), or a casein hydrolysate formula ( GH ). The study population comprises newborn infants who have been fed formula or a commercially available whey-based formula. All infants were followed to 18 months of age. The primary outcome was the incidence of allergic outcomes. The control group was compared with a control group consisting of 54 identically defined “ high-risk ” infants born in 1985 in the same area. All the infants had either severe single atopic predisposition, the introduction of milk other than breast milk, or to a conventional formula. The follow-up time was estimated using carmine red. The cumulative incidence of wheezing illness was 18 % by age 7, 24 % by year 16, and 43 % by the control group. The parents were highly motivated and compliance was good. The rate of participation was 97 %, and 85 % followed the dietary measures strictly. The median S-αLA concentration at 2 years of age was significantly higher in those infants, in place of st and ard cow's milk formula, ( p < 0.02 ). There were weaker independent associations with female sex, maternal albuminuria during pregnancy, and histories of eczema and migraine. If hydrolysed formulas are effective, to determine what type of hydrolysed formula is most effective.. The incidence of infant formulas containing hydrolysed proteins have been widely advocated for preventing allergic disease in infants, including extensively or partially hydrolysed infant formula ( EHF/PHF ).

An ongoing double blind multicenter study is comparing the effects and side effects of prednisone, or in combination with prednisone, improves strength.  Ninety-nine boys ( aged five to 15 years ) with DMD. After 1 year, all the above changes remained significantly improved and the MRC index was significantly better ( P < 0.05 ). Increased body weight was not prominent and was controlled with dietary measures. At the end of 6 months, the group that was changed from daily to alternate-day therapy, had improvement in the time needed to rise from a supine to a st and ing position ( 3.4 vs. 6.2 seconds ), to walk 9 m ( 7.0 vs. 9.7 seconds ) ; and to climb four stairs ( 4.0 to 7.1 seconds ).  Azathioprine did not have a beneficial effect. This study suggests that prednisone's beneficial effect is not due to immunosuppression, in children with Duchenne Dystrophy ( DD ). There was an increase in urinary creatinine excretion ( 261 vs. 190 mg per 24 hours )... The results suggest that ( i ) DFC and PRED in equal anti-inflammatory dosage are similarly or equally efficient in slowing down the decline of muscle strength in DMD ; ( ii ) benefits outweigh the side effects."

29990473," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of alpha-lipoic acid ( ALA ) treatment on glycemic control and lipid profiles in patients with diabetes mellitus ( DM ). The novel strategies required to counteract these serious consequences, however, should avoid modulating the activities of the neurotransmitter receptors involved because those receptors are the therapeutic targets of AAPDs. METHODS A total of 30 patients with type 2 diabetes were included in this r and omized, placebo-controlled, 20-week trial. The control group received an ordinary diet ( 4.89 % fat, w/w ).. The other two experimental groups were additionally treated with ALA ( 600 mg/day ) or placebo. The weight, the levels of serum lipids and MDA and SOD activity were measured before and after the intervention. The primary end point was body weight change from baseline to end point. RESULTS : The plasma levels of cholesterol, albumin, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( HDL-C ), and malondialdehyde level were compared between the 2 groups. The mean ( SD ) weight loss was 3.16 ( 3.20 ) kg ( P < 0.01 ). NIHSS score, total cholesterol, triglycerides and HOMA-IA of  the experiment group decreased significantly ( P<0.001 ) ; and no significant adverse reactions were found in the placebo group. CONCLUSION This systematic review and meta- analysis of r and Omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) was performed to summarize the effect of alpha -lipoic acid, treatment and lipid profile among patients with metabolic diseases."
24370176," OBJECTIVE To investigate the prevalence, stability, and predictors of clinical ly significant behavior problems in infants born in the 1990s with threshold retinopathy of prematurity ( ROP ). METHODS : This was a prospect i ve cohort study of all preterm infants who were < 37 weeks'gestation and /or body weight < or = 1500 grams ) performed subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, the Visual Motor Integration test, a 15-Word Memory Test and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children at school age. RESULTS : At 4 to 12 years of age, motor outcome was assessed by the Gross Motor Function Classification System and  the Manual Ability Classification System. The purpose of this study was to empirically confirm the factorial validity of these children.  The German normative sample of AB2 ( 7 - 10 years ; N=323 ) was used as the study sample for the empirical analyses. Analysis of specific subscales of behavior revealed significant associations with anxious/depressed and withdrawn behaviors, as well as an increased likelihood of attention problems among children with VLD.. The ELBW or very preterm children scored significantly below NBW controls on full-scale IQ ( mean difference, -9.4 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1.21–2.09 ), and school-based rehabilitation services were significantly less common in children with favorable visual status. Favorable visual status, favorable functional ratings at 5.5 years, markers of higher socioeconomic status, and nonblack race were associated with significantly lower rates of both special education placement and below- grade -level academic performance at age 8. On multivariate logistic regression, only favorable visual Status and functional status remained significant predictors for decreasing special education enrollment. CONCLUSIONS : Neonatal hydrocortisone treatment for BPD had no real burdens regarding cognition, achievement, behavior, and socioemotional development throughout childhood and adolescence.. and)."

The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of iron supplementation for patients with IBD. We performed a single-blind, multicenter study of 46 patients with anemia and transferrin saturation ≤20 % and /or serum ferritin levels ≤20 μg/L. The intravenous group received a single dose of iron sucrose of 7 mg iron/kg body weight, followed by five 200 mg infusions for the following 5 wks. The treatment outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. The patients were r and omized 2:1 to receive either IV iron isomaltoside ( 30 mg twice a day ) or identical placebo for 12 weeks. The primary end points were the self-reported Patient Global Assessment and NYHA functional class, both at week 12. Secondary end points included the incidence of anemia, Crohn's Disease Activity Index scores, C-reactive protein, and adverse events. The most frequent type was combined anemia ( 63 % ). Combined anemia was observed in 2 patients ( 1.0 % ), followed to 3.5 % of the patients. Pure ACD was present in 21 % of patients treated with iron supplementation, whereas none of patients achieved the full tolerability. The secondary end points, which tested for superiority, included: anemia was the most frequent complication of IBD, the anemia was mostly due to iron deficiency, has long been neglected..

29306984," BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a home-based exercise program versus control ( usual activities ) on the number of falls and the risk for falling in older women. The study covered subjects aged 60 to 80 years. We identified 40 women who reported a history of osteoporotic fractures. The subjects were recruited using direct mailings and a community information campaign. The participants were r and omized to either the exercise intervention ( n = 20 ) or control group. The intervention group attended individual sessions with an experienced clinician once a week for 10 weeks and performed daily home exercises with adherence monitored by a self-report diary. The control group received no treatment. Primary outcomes were changes between baseline and nine months of bone mineral density ( BMD ) of the proximal femur and lumbar spine ( dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ) and serum markers of bone resorption and formation. Secondary outcomes included quality of life. In a sub sample ( n= 16 ), postural stability, and gait speed were assessed at baseline and 12 months ( p<0.05 ). In terms of QoL, the intervention group showed significant reductions in pain during movement ( 10.68 foot pounds, P<.001 ) and in the control group ( -0.08, P=.011 ). The PT group maintained BMD at the spine ( + 0.7 + /- 0.2 % ( SE ) ) and decreased the gait speed ( -4.8 ( -9.2 ; p=.03 ). There were no significant differences between groups in measures of Timed Up and Go, SIP ( -1.8 % to 13 %, p = 0.002 ). Conclusion Osteoporosis affects many aspects of daily life, we strongly encourage the effects of exercise interventions on functional outcomes in persons with osteoporosis, in comparison with controls."
15789890," The final development of the Sickness Impact Profile ( SIP ), a behaviorally based measure of health status, is presented. A large field trial involving 255 patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) was a 12-week, r and omized controlled trail of diclofenac, naproxen, and aspirin. Two trials were open-label studies of 24 weeks duration that included 165 RA and 355 osteoarthritis ( OA ) patients. The cohort comprised 117 families enrolled from the general population of pregnant women at admission to antenatal care. Data on parental tobacco smoking were obtained by interview and  exhaled CO  was measured ( Micro-Smokerlyzer(R ) ) in parents twice during pregnancy and when the child was 6 and 18 months old. The third aim was to investigate the assumption that convergent validity results in stronger correlations when compared to divergent validity. The final application demonstrates the utility of these instruments and question naires for the assessment of  disabilities  in personal care in patients with rheumatic disorders."
21154394," BACKGROUND Although many patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) benefit from treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SRIs ), it is estimated that 40 % to 60 % of them do not respond to this treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine to placebo, in patients with OCD. : Patients with OCD, who had not responded to SRIs, were not included. The treatment was well tolerated, with only one premature dropout in each treatment-group. RESULTS Both the fluoxetine-plus-olanzapine ( n = 22 ) and placebo-treated group were assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( Y-BOCS ). In these data, ICCs were inversely related to cluster size, but the difference was not statistically significant.. The mean + /- SD baseline YBOCS score of 31.4 ± /- 7.8 dropped to a mean of 20.8 + / - 8.4 at endpoint. At the final visit, all patients were unresponsive to at least 1 course of at least 12 weeks of treatment, with the majority of responders ( 60 % ) and one ( 7.1 % ) partial improvement in their OCD. The study was conducted from November 2003 to June 2005 at the University Medical Centre Utrecht, The Netherl and s.

31745834," BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is the main therapeutic goal in patients with atrial fibrillation, because the prevention of recurrences can improve cardiac function and relieve symptoms. Uncontrolled studies have suggested that amiodarone in low doses may be more effective and safer than other agents in preventing recurrence, but this agent has not been tested in a large, r and omized trial. METHODS The Atrial Fibrillation study in Argentina ( FARAON ) was an observational, descriptive, prospect i ve, national, and multicentric study that included patients with AF. Patients in the rhythm-control group were masked to group assignment. Follow-up was for a mean of 2.7 years ( SD, 1.2 ). Patients from North America, western Europe, and Australia were used as the reference population, and compared with patients from the other seven regions FINDINGS Between Dec 24, 2007, and Oct 21, 2011, we enrolled 15 400 patients to the registry. There were no difference between mean Mini-Mental State Examination scores in people assigned to warfarin or aspirin at 9 or 21 months. At 33-month follow-up, there was a nonsignificant difference of 0.56 in favor of the group. The arrhythmia management strategy was not predictive of clinical events. The type ( persistent ), presence at baseline visit, and duration ( > 3 months ) of AF, together with age older than 75 years and the presence of heart failure, predicted progression to permanent AF. The choice of rhythm control reduced the likelihood of AF progression ( odds ratio : 0.24 ; 95 % confidence interval : 1.10 to 1.39 ). The impact of this study was to determine the impact of rhythm versus rate control on clinical outcomes in older adults."
31766052," BACKGROUND To compare the performance of mammography, the combination of screening with tomo synthesis ( BT ) and the three-dimensional ( 3D ). We compared the effect of screening on the incidence of breast cancer, tumour size, node status, histological type, therapy and outcome in 1053 breast cancers diagnosed in one county of the Swedish Two-County Trial.  Each examination was independently interpreted by four radiologists.. The study was based on two sequential phases, 2D-mammography alone and combined 2D+3D.  Participants underwent one-view DBT and two-view digital mammographies ( DM ), with independent double reading and scoring. The FP recall rate  was 1.7 % for  BT alone  ( n = 131 ). The number of detected and non-detected ( including interval ) cancers, cancer detection rates ( % ) and false positive recall ( FPR ), and death from all causes within the breast cancer cases. We estimated the false : true positive ( FP : TP ) ratio and sensitivity of each mammographic screening strategy... There were fewer breast cancer incidence and mortality by time since screening, with the use of software that allowed synthetic 2D mammograographic images to be reconstructed from 3D. The recall rate was 2.7 ( 2530/378 ) to 3.6 ( 820/24,922 ), respectively ( P = 0.005 ). Breast cancer detection was 7.1 ( 90/12,621 ) and 1.8 per 1000 examinations for women with breast cancer. The screening rate was not uniform across the European Council since 2003 ( 2 ).. the implementation of screening programs in the United Kingdom and Europe is not uniform among the population.. The European Commission on Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis has not been uniform across Europe and depends greatly on their policies in place, the recognition of. and.. These guidelines inform women -based screening programs, and we believe that the screening programs are not in place.. Although the study was internally valid, there was a small number of false-positive results and overdiagnosis. The implementation of organized.. screening is not universal across Europe but the quality of screening is very low..-, )."
20655610," BACKGROUND The Diabetes Prevention Program ( DPP ) showed that an intensive lifestyle intervention can reduce the development of diabetes by more than half in adults with impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ). We carried out post hoc analyses on the role of lifestyle intervention in preventing type 2 diabetes in the DPP lifestyle participants. The study was a 12-month r and omized controlled trial in 487 middle-aged men and women with diabetes ( mean age = 50.6, BMI = 33.9, 68 % female, and 46 % from minority groups ). The control group received general dietary and exercise advice at baseline and had an annual physician's examination. The intervention group received additional individualized dietary counseling from a nutritionist. The cohort was followed up for a median of 3 years, with median total follow-up of 7 years. The mean age of the participants was 51 years, and the mean body-mass index ( BMI ), and dietary intakes of fat, saturated fat, and fibre were measured. RESULTS The mean duration of study was 3.2 years.. The incidence of diabetes was 4.3 and 7.4 per 100 person-years in  the intervention and control group, respectively ( log-rank test p=0.0001 ), indicating 43 % reduction in relative risk. The risk reduction was related to the success in achieving the lifestyle intervention goals of weight loss, reduced intake of total and saturated fat and increased intake of dietary fibre, and increased physical activity. The overall population of diabetics was 67.7 % ( 95 % CI, 59.8–75.2 ), which was significantly more effective than metformin. The need for evidence translation is needed if the behavioral change strategies for lifestyle T2D prevention programs."
28178949," OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy and tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) with placebo in the treatment of major depressive disorder ( MDD ). A double-blind parallel-group design was used, with therapy lasting six weeks.. The first goal was to identify, during the first 2 weeks of treatment, the onset of clinical actions of the SSRI, placebo, and active-controlled study ( D1448C00004 ). Patients received either venlafaxine XR 75 - 225 mg/day ( n = 100 ), fluoxetine 20 - 60 mg /day, or a placebo. The primary efficacy measure was the Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression ( HAM-D ) ; the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ), and the Clinician's Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale ( CGI-SI ). RESULTS Both citalopram and sertraline produced significantly greater improvement from baseline compared to placebo. the mean change from baseline to week 8 in Hamilton depression rating scale total and item 1. There was no significant difference in clinical depression ratings at week 8 between the escitalopram and placebo-treated patients. The results suggest that short-term SSRI treatment in depressed patients remediates depression symptoms more rapidly than the placebo controls..

27027426," Previous observational studies on the association between potassium intake and risk of hypertension have almost exclusively relied on self-reported dietary data, whereas repeated 24-hour urine excretions, as estimate of dietary uptake, may provide a more objective and quantitative estimate of this association. We prospect ively studied the associations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitaminD with  hypertension risk ( blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg or initiation of blood pressure – lowering drugs ) in 5066 participants aged 28 to 75 years, free of hypertension at baseline from the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease ( PREVEND ) study. Potassium excretion was measured in two 24- hour urine specimens at baseline ( 1997–1998 ) and midway during follow-up ( 2001–2003 ). Baseline median potassium excretion ( 70 mmol/24 h ( interquartile range, 57–85 mmol/ 24 h ), which corresponds to a dietary potassium intake of ≈91 mmol/kg. We assessed each SNP for an association  with circulating 25(OH)D concentration ( 5449 non-cases ; two studies ), risk of type 2 diabetes ( 28 144 cases, 76 344 non-controls ; five studies ). As expected, low 25-Hydroxyvitamin B was associated with a higher hypertension risk ; each 1-SD decrement in 25-OHroxyvitamin C was associatedwith a 8 % higher hypertension Risk ( hazard ratio, 1.08 ; 95 % confidence interval, 1-1.16 ), compared with the upper 2 tertiles ( Pnonlinearity=0.008 ). The proportion of hypertension attributable to hypovitaminosis D ( defined as low 25 hydroxiyvitamin D levels ) as a potential risk factor for orthostatic hypotension, was not significant ( p>0·25 ). We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis examining the relationship of sodium to potassium excentration, type of hypertension, age, sex, BMI, renal function, comorbidities, and supplementation with cholecalciferol."
24082796," OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that the effectiveness of a combined methylpheni date /behavioural treatment ( BT ), compared with placebo, in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ).. The authors conducted a case-control, 10-year prospect i ve study of children with ADHD. The present study was conducted to examine whether the outcomes of ADHD, antisocial personality disorder ( ASPD ), substance use disorders ( SUDs ), adult-onset psychiatric disorders, psychiatric hospitalizations, and incarcerations than non-ADHD comparison participants at a mean age of 41 years. RESULTS At the 4-year follow-up assessment, the majority of children were r and omized for 2 years to receive the following treatments : ( 1 ) methyl pheni date alone, ( 2 ) methylpheno date plus psychosocial treatment that included parent training and counseling, social skills training, and academic assistance.. CONCLUSIONS In nearly every analysis, there was no significant difference between the two groups on any measure of ADHD.. Children with ADHD and their parents reported the same outcomes of the intervention.. For a minority of children, ADHD was a transient disorder that remits early in development. In addition, we have shown that persistence of ADHD is predictable. Familiality, adversity, and psychiatric comorbidity may be clinical ly useful predictors of which children's ADHD are at risk for a persistent disorder. The results of this study provide further evidence for the high morbidity associated with ADHD, but in several instances ( oppositional/aggressive symptoms, internalizing symptoms, teacher-rated social skills, parent-child relations, and reading achievement )."
27153869," Background Mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) is a well-recognised risk factor for the early diagnosis of dementia. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and putative interactions between the apoE ε4 allele and lifestyle related risk factors for dementia and AD. A computer program is available that can be used for studies with dichotomous, continuous, or survival response measures. The available data come from four European population -based prospect i ve studies of individuals 65 years and older, with varying income and functional status levels. One attractive solution that aligns with the above criteria is exercise.. The program can determine the sample size needed to detect a specified alternative hypothesis for dementia or those who failed the screening tests. A model to predict energy expenditure from activity counts and body mass was developed using data from a r and om sample of 35 subjects ( r2 = 0.82, SEE = 1.40 kcal x min(-1 ) ). Cross validation with data from the remaining 15 subjects revealed no significant differences between actual and predicted energy expenditure at any treadmill speed ( SEE =. The study was conducted in FORTRAN-77 and is in the public domain. Conclusion The increasing rate of all-cause dementia worldwide and the lack of effective pharmaceutical treatments emphasise the value of lifestyle approaches as prevention strategies. Emerging evidence suggests sedentary behaviour is associated with impaired cognitive function. A better underst and ing of how to best promote healthy cognitive ageing. Thus, we conducted a systematic review ascertaining the contribution of sedentary behaviour towards associated changes in cognitive function over the adult lifespan."
29728079," OBJECTIVE To evaluate if poor oral status was associated with percentage body fat in a representative sample of south Brazilian community-dwelling elderly. BACKGROUND Evidence suggests that elders with extensive tooth loss and edentulism present with compromised chewing function, which results in dietary changes. The purpose of this prospect i ve longitudinal study was to investigate whether eating quickly was related to being overweight in Japanese university students. MATERIAL S AND METHODS A r and om sample of 872 independently living elderly was evaluated by means of a cross-sectional study. Socio-demographic, medical history and behaviour data were assessed using a st and ardised question naire. Two trained dentists assessed the  number of teeth and use of prostheses  in accordance with the WHO criteria. Height and weight were assessed and used to generate body mass index ( BMI = weight (kilos)/height (cm)(2 ) ) data. Participants were categorised into non-obese ( BMI < or= 30 ) or obese ( BMI > 30 ). The relationship between number of lingual tears and obesity was significant... Oral tearrs had 1.4 ( 95%CI 1.1;1.9 ) times higher odds of being central ly obese than those with a higher number of geth ; however, the association lost significance after adjustment for confounders. In comparison with edentate males, edentate females presented a twofold higher adjusted prevalence of general and central obesity. A similar pattern was observed when the number of posterior occluding pairs was compared with BMI categories. Results of multiple logistic regression were adjusted for the confounding effects of age, social class, region of origin and partial denture wearing. Conclusion A substantial number of adults suffer from obesity, that is caused by the risk factor, masticatory dysfunction. The association between mastication and obesity, however, is inconclusive. This systematic review aims to provide literature regarding the correlation between masticated and factors affecting masticatory function, and obesity in adults."

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole, risperidone, and other antipsychotics in patients with early-stage schizophrenia. METHODS The study was an 8-week treatment, double-blind, parallel-group, noninterventional study with 3 treatment arms. In the open label extension, the use of lithium and fluoxetine was permitted for patients who experienced breakthrough symptoms. The primary outcome was the total scores on the Young-Mania Rating Scale ( Y-MRS ) total score. The sampling frame of 113 patients aged 18 years or older included those who completed the study. The main outcome measure was cognitive changes at 3-year follow-up. A total of 224 patients completed their initial assessment, and the PANSS  trials, 36.7 % for clozapine, 40.2 % for risperidone, 39.6 % for olanztapine, and 40.4 % for aripiprazole. There were no significant differences among the 3 groups in score changes. The olanzole group had significant improvement in Y-ARS total and PANSS subscales, than placebo-treated patients ( -14.8 + /- 12.5 ). The prevalence of mood disorders was 6.1 % ( 5.7 - 6.6 ), anxiety disorders was 5.6 percent ( 5-6.3 ), and psychotic disorders was 1.0 % ( 0.8 - 1.1 ).

These studies may be susceptible to systematic error, including selection bias, exposure misclassification, and outcome misclassification. We performed a case-control study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital and 6 community hospitals in the southeastern United States. The purpose of this study was to identify the incidence of SSI in patients who underwent surgery between February 2002 and January 2003.. The incidence of surgical site infections were identified in patients with SSI, and the risk factors were extracted. The National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance ( NNIS ) system criteria and method were used for identifying and diagnosing SSI. The type of surgery was identified among 503 cases included in  the study, with a result ing overall infection rate of 6.2 %. A stepwise multiple logistic regression method was used. RESULTS Of the 844 patients studied, 35 SSIs were diagnosed, yielding an incidence rate of 4.1 % ( 95 % confidence interval (CI)=1.34 - 2.32 ). The 1-year mortality rate for SSI ( 2.0 % ), and reoperation for cardiac tamponade or pericard effusion were independent risk factors associated with surgical-site infection..

26629535," OBJECTIVE The authors evaluated the prevalence of anxiety disorders in bipolar disorder.. The authors tested the hypothesis that in patients with bipolar disorder and a co-occurring anxiety disorder, the authors sought to determine the effect of anxiety on the acute treatment response of bipolar disorder, using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. RESULTS A current comorbid anxiety disorder ( present in 31.9 % of participants ) was associated with fewer days well, a lower likelihood of timely recovery from depression, risk of earlier relapse, lower quality of life and diminished role function. The findings were comparable to rates typically reported in non-veteran inpatient sample s ( 33.8 % current, 72.3 % lifetime ). Primary and key secondary endpoints were change from baseline to week 6 for both the 20 - 60 mg/day group ( -15.4 ; effect size=0.51 ). The odds ratio was 17.99 ( 95 percent confidence interval, 12.18 to 26.58 ).. CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that anxiety disorders were associated with greater likelihood of relapse, whereas depression was not.. Among all the potential comorsbidities, co-existing anxiety disorders among bipolar disorder patients took 27 weeks longer than those who reported no anxiety disorders. The study, although preliminary, suggests an increased risk of a substance use disorder ( hazard ratio of 2.4 ), typically meeting diagnostic criteria during or after the first major mood episode. The evolution of psychopathology leading to bipolar disorder generally followed the proposed sequence, although not all subjects manifest all stages. CONCLUSIONS Bipolar affective disorder has a high rate of comorodity with a multitude of psychiatric disorders and medical conditions. Among the many possible co-morbidities, co-existent anxiety disorders st and out due to their high prevalence.

26323052," Although Post-traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) is common among patients seeking care at medical clinics, little is known about the performance of screening instruments for this disorder in these setting s. We used data from a systematic review of magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) in the characterization of suspected brain tumors to provide a preliminary evaluation of the inter-rater reliability of QUADAS. MATERIAL S AND METHODS A structured literature search identified 19 diagnostic accuracy studies. These publications were distributed r and omly to primary and secondary review ers for dual independent assessment. The test-retest kappa for the 200 interviews was.84, indication of excellent agreement. We calculated correlation, percentage of agreement, and kappa statistic to assess the diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS Most studies in our review were judged to have used an accurate reference st and ard.. The positive and negative likelihood ratios for these cut score were 3.40 and 0.24, respectively. By comparison, the use of 45 as a cut score would result in very low sensitivity (.36 ) and specificity. The lower cut score found in this study may indicate that the value of using the PCL ) as a clinical screening test, there has been no comprehensive quality review of studies evaluating its diagnostic accuracy."
24362925," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of an exercise program, which included aerobic, flexibility and strengthening elements, in the treatment of fibromyalgia. A 10-week r and omized controlled trial was utilized. The participants were identified and randomized to either an aerobic exercise ( AE ) program or a strengthening exercise ( SE ) program. A total of 32 subjects aged 60 - 84 years with a mean age of 71.3 + /- 1.2 years was used. The primary outcomes were the Fibromyalgia Impact Question naire ( FIQ ) total score and the 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ). Secondary outcomes were pain, total myalgic scores ( TM ), and fitness. Paffenbarger Activity Index. Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS ).. Within-group paired t tests were performed to compare baseline data with 3-month follow-up data. The exercise training group increased their average daily steps by 54 %. We examined the literature on resistance training for individuals with fibromyalgia. The study showed that the exercise group was significantly ( p <.0125 ), but not the control group. The majority of the patients ( 57 % ) had no significant differences in pain, sleep, fatigue, tender point count, and anxiety, as well as quality of life ( QOL ). Post study assessment s, however, showed a significantly larger decrease in exercise heart rate ( P = 0.020 ) and significantly improved scores on the FIQ, pain, and SF-36. BACKGROUND Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread pain that leads to reduced physical function. Exercise training is commonly recommended as a treatment for management of symptoms. We compared resistance treatment is exercise performed against a progressive resistance with the intention of improving muscle strength, muscle endurance, and a combination of these. We explored the benefits and harms of resistance type versus control and versus other types of exercise treatment."

The patients with hypertensive emergencies were treated with sublingual nifedipine 10 mg or sublingual captopril 25 mg in a r and omized multicenter study. In addition the effect of this treatment on blood pressure and heart rate was investigated using xenon-133 in 10 patients. The blood pressure dropped after 5 min in the placebo group and after 30 min, 120 min, and 240 min. The efficacy of these drugs was analyzed by Student's t test. Both drugs tested revealed a statistically significant hypotensive effect on diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and few side effects. Compared with placebo, the mean blood pressure ( BP ) decreased with diazoxide from an average of 241/149 mmHg to 180/111 mmHg after 5 minutes, and after 4 weeks of chlorthalidone.. There were no side effects, including a dangerous fall in blood pressure or reflex tachycardia. The mean arterial pressure dropped significantly in both groups. The patient had a mean APEX improvement of 43 % ( i.e., to 57 % of initial distress ) ; the group given the current st and ard regimen plus placebo improved only 25 % ( p less than 0.001 ), and brachial and renal resistances ( -44 % versus -14 %, P = 0.01 for diastolic values ). There was no significant differences in clinical course between the two groups, but the patients receiving nifedipine had a slightly lower blood pressure than the other groups."
22232096," OBJECTIVE To pilot test the feasibility and effectiveness of interactive voice response ( IVR ) calls targeting physical activity and healthful eating as strategies for weight loss for patients with pre-diabetes. METHODS A six-session DPP, modeled after the successful National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) DPP, was implemented in a rural African-American church. Adult members of the church identified as high risk for diabetes, based on results of a risk question naire, were screened with a fasting glucose. Persons with prediabetes... The intervention group received a 6-session r and omized controlled trial conducted from September 2001 to September 2002 in Providence, RI, of 92 overweight adults whose mean ( SD ) age was 48.5 ( 9.4 ) years and body mass index, 33.1 ( 3.8 ). RESULTS Ninety-nine adult church members were screened for diabetes risk. The direct medical costs of care outside the DPP were $ 272 less per participant in the metformin group and $ 432 less in  the lifestyle group compared with the placebo group. After the intervention and 12-month follow-up, there was a mean weight loss of 7.9 lbs and 10.6 lbs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Small-group participants  lost significantly more weight than did their matched controls. A significantly higher proportion of small-group attendees  lost at least 5 % of their body weight compared with controls."
29465026," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, was compared with placebo and imipramine in patients with major depressive disorder. This multicenter trial of citalopram versus placebo in patients diagnosed with major depression. The primary efficacy measure was the change from baseline in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ). The study was designed to determine the active dose of sertraline versus placebo on almost all measures. This study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 12 academic and community psychiatric hospitals. The patients with recurrent major depression were treated with placebo or a flexible daily dose of 50 mg/d, fluoxetine 20 to 60 mg, or placebo for up to 8 weeks.  Depression and sexual-functioning status were assessed by site-specific trained investigators at weekly clinic visits ; tolerability was assessed primarily by monitoring adverse events. RESULTS The drug/placebo difference in Hamilton depression Rating Scale scores ( Full Analysis Set LOCF ) was -1.8 ( 95 % CI = -3.41 to -0.19, p =.029 ) for paroxetine. The mean changes from baseline to endpoint in Hamilton score were -7.4 points ( SD=6.3 ) for sirtraline and -6.6 points ( P = 0.015 ).. The incidence of adverse events was 65 % in CR, 69 % in IR and 55 % in placebo. The efficacy of the 2 primary outcome measures, the imipramine groups reported more anticholinergic effects ( dry mouth, dizziness, and urinary retention ) and was superior to placebo on the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale ( p <.01 ) and the patient-rated measures of depression severity ( P <.001 ). The study also demonstrated the superiority of fluoxetine over the other treatments."
29211740," This study aims to determine the efficacy of a r and omized controlled trial of preschool-based social communication treatment for children with autism. The intervention consisted of  24 caregiver-mediated sessions  with follow-up 1 year later. Compared to caregivers and toddlers, the intervention group ( n = 9) and control group to the same type of intervention. The study found that children in the treatment group made significantly more gains in their joint attention, their social communication, and their parents than the control group. After several decades when few studies on autism were conducted, they showed significantly more and lengthier events of these two types of joint attention. The outcomes of children with ASD were assessed from video-taped preschool teacher-child and mother-child interactions. The theoretical and clinical implication of this study was that both intervention groups had similar outcomes. The results of the study showed that the children with Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ). To achieve better quality of unbiased evidence for the effectiveness of ASD interventions, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive review that covers studies with adequate quality st and ards, such as RCT, RCT, and RCT, to identify the strengths and weaknesses of autism interventions. In contrast, we categorize interventions for ASD as behavioural, social-communication focused, and multimodal developmental based on Howlin's classification of autism spectrum disorder."
28474733," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of quetiapine monotherapy in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. The third version is based explicitly on the available evidence and presented, like previous Clinical Practice Guidelines, as recommendations to aid clinical decision making for patients with this condition. The current study examines co-morbid DBD and aggression prospect ively as predictors of pharmacotherapy outcome, as well as potential moderators of response to a specific medication ( risperidone vs. divalproex ). The study participants were r and omized to placebo ( n = 58 ), risperidone 0.5 - 12/50 mg/day, or placebo. Primary outcome was the change in Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) scores from baseline. The primary efficacy measure was mean change in YMRS score from baseline to end point. The secondary outcome measure was change in CDRS-R. The mean final dose was 27.6 ± 5.5. The most common adverse events ( AE ) were nausea, vomiting, and lethargy. The majority of patients were treated with aripiprazole, 30 patients ( mean age = 7.1 years ) were controlled, and 12 ( 63 % ) responded to our secondary criteria. The use of medication was associated with a significant shortterm improvement of symptoms of bipolar disorder, with an average lithium concentration of 1.0 ( 0.3 ) mg/L. The goal of this review is, thus, to systematic ally examine the impact of atypical antipsychotics ( AAPs ) and mood stabilisers in the treatment of bipolar depression and /or mixed states. CONCLUSIONS The management of depressive and mixed symptoms in pediatric bipolar disorder ( BD ) remains a matter of debate.

31616340," OBJECTIVE Cognitive dysfunction is an increasingly important public health problem, and it is possible that such improvements are found at extended follow-ups. We performed a prospect i ve weight loss study that measured cognitive function. We used the  Stroop Task, Iowa Gambling Task ( IGT ), Wisconsin Card Sorting Task ( WCST ), Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology ( IDS-SR ), and Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS  ). One hundred thirty-four healthy adult volunteers completed a moderate dose of ethanol ( 0.5 or 0.8 g/kg ethanol : n = 12 at each dose ) or placebo. The question naire was repeated 12 months later. The intervention led to significant weight loss of 5.8±3.1 kg ( p<0.05 ) and a significant improvement in executive function. Short-term improvements in memory were maintained at 36 months. In total, 124 determinants were identified of which 5 were demographic, 59 were behavioural, 51 were psychological/cognitive and 9 were social and physical environmental determinants. We found consistent evidence that the cognitive function was not predictive of weight loss. The behavioral and cognitive determinants that promote a reduction in energy intake, an increase in energy expenditure and monitoring of this balance are predictive determinants. The cognitive and achievement results suggest that cognitive functions of overweight or obesity are a significant health problem. The knowledge of the factors which influences the inappropriate eating behaviors causing excessive body fat is an essential goal for the research.Conclusion : The increasing incidence of people affected by obesity, such as cardiovascular problems, diabetes, and other disorders, has been identified. This systematic review is aim ed to investigate the relationship between excessive body weight ( overweight/obesity ) and executive functions, analyzing cross-sectional, and longitudinal studies in order to verify the evidence of a possible causality between these variables."
26449638," Background. The atraumatic restorative treatment technique ( ART ) is based on removing infected tooth material using only h and instruments and filling the subsequently cleaned cavity with adhesive material such as glass ionomer. The objective of this empirical study is to test the null-hypothesis that trends and performance differences inferred from naïve-indirect comparisons and from direct comparisons/ RCTs regarding the failure rates of  amalgam and direct high-viscosity glass-ionomer cement ( HVGIC ) restorations in permanent posterior teeth have similar direction and magnitude. Methods A total of 896 citations were identified through systematic literature search. From these, ten and two uncontrolled clinical longitudinal studies for HVG IC and amalgam.. Internal trial validity assessment was based on the underst and ing that successful control for systematic error can not be assured on  the basis of inclusion of adequate methods alone, but also requires empirical evidence about whether such attempt was successful. Results A comprehensive and interconnected coverage of GIC-related clinical topics was established. The most common reasons found for gaps in trial precision were lack of adequate trials and lack of sufficient large sample size. Only a few research gaps were ascribed to ‘ Lack of information ’ caused by focus on mainly surrogate trial outcomes. The survival of glass ionomer cement restorations  made with r and omisation, allocation concealment and blinding/masking in trials covering all review ed GIC typeics was noted ( selection - and detection/performance bias risk ). Trial results appear to be less affected by loss-to-follow-up ( attrition bias risk )). Conclusion This audit represents an adjunct of the systematic review articles it has covered. Trends and performance comparisons inferred from either comparison between HVGICT and amalgam restorations failure rates in permanent tooth types are not the same. It is recommended that clinical practice guidance regarding HVGICOs should rest on direct comparisons via RCTs and not on naïve-Indirect comparisons based on uncontrolled longitourinary studies."
16530201," The effect of fish oil supplement has been proposed as a non-pharmacological strategy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. This study was undertaken to determine whether this effect was due to reduced production or increased clearance of chylomicrons. The objective was to evaluate the effect of a high-dose ethylester concentrate of n-3 fatty acids ( fish oil ) on serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and the activity of blood monocytes. RESULTS : After a run-in period of 6 mon, 120 clinical ly healthy hypercholesterolemic ( 7.0–9.5 mmol/L ), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ). Following a successful angioplasty, 204 patients received a dietary supplementation with either 9 g fish oil ( 3 g EPA ) or 6 g olive oil ( placebo)/d for two 6-week intervention periods. As a marker of in vivo oxidation malondialdehyde concentration in LDL ( LDL-MDA ) was measured. Compared with those in the olive oil group, the mean serum triacylglycerols were significantly reduced in those receiving fish oil.. A wash-out period of 4 wk hardly altered the level of n -3 PUFA in serum... At the end of the study, serum total cholesterol increased 0.49 mg/L ( P = 0.002 ) and a larger 20 % increase in LDL apolipoprotein B ( apoB ) concentration was observed.. The change ( delta ) in fasting and PP TG levels ( P<0.001 ), PP non-esterified fatty acid ( NEFA ), which may facilitate the reduction in LDL-C, and plasma apoA1 levels.

27765009," BACKGROUND The symptom iceberg describes the phenomenon that most patients with chronic fatigue in primary care. We undertook a prospect i ve evaluation of patients presenting to 28 primary care practice s with a chief complaint of fatigue.. The study was conducted in an integrated data base which contains the medical records for 58,139 patients and their 696,518 associated general practitioner encounters.  Patients were excluded if they had a previously diagnosed illness associated with fatigue. We extracted data on diagnoses during the follow-up period from the patients ’ medical records as well as data on pre-existing chronic diseases. RESULTS One hundred and eighty-two consecutive patients ( 53 % ) had at least one pathology test ordered at any time in their episode of care. The diagnoses were diverse and mostly included symptom diagnoses, with main categories being musculoskeletal ( 19.4 % ) and psychological problems ( 16.5 % ). Of the cancer patients, 106 ( 40 % ) were diagnosed with a significant clinical diagnosis.. Although often self-limiting and frequently associated with psychosocial stress, patients but also their physicians are often uncertain regarding a serious cause and appropriate diagnostic work-up. CONCLUSIONS Data of 325 patients were analysed ( 71 % women ; mean age 41 years ). Although rarely associated with cancer, patients who tested positive on a screening test for fatigue reported more annual medical visits ( 5.3 versus 3.4 ) than other patients. We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of studies reporting on differential diagnosis of fatigue in Primary care."

However, the specific effects of active gaming when delivered within the context of a pediatric weight management program are unknown. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of active video games over a 6-mo period on weight, body composition, physical activity, and physical fitness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Group-r and omized clinical trial conducted during a 16-week period in YMCAs and schools located in Massachusetts, Rhode Isl and, and Texas. RESULTS All fourth- grade students in participating elementary schools were invited to participate. The findings link competitive exergame play to beneficial cognitive outcomes for at-risk ethnic minority adolescents.. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in body mass index ( BMI ), but most do not. Only 3 very small trials have considered the effects of exergaming on physical activity levels and /or other health outcomes in children. Results from these trials indicated that children created an implementation intention ( none, action, coping, both ) as part of goal setting. Participants were 4th and 5th grade children ( ~9 - 11 years old ) and no trial has assessed the long-term impact of the intervention. The change ( ±SE ) in BMI from baseline increased in the control group than during the resting control and seated video game conditions..Conclusion Children participating in Squire's Quest! increased their FJV intake, assessed via three, dietitian-assisted telephone recalls at each data collection period. The primary analysis was conducted using a repeated measures analysis of covariance with a mixed model procedure. Secondary analyses examined intervention effects on fruit and vegetables.

31118956," Introduction : Recent findings on the association of gut microbiota with obesity, but direct evidence of effects of its modulation on body fat mass is still scarce. We have recently shown that obesity and fatty liver are reduced by a probiotic yogurt ( PY ) compared with a st and ard low-fat yogurt ( LF ). We aim ed to evaluate whether the changes in adiposity after supplementation with Lactobacillus strains were associated with metabolic intermediates. A r and omized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 66 non-diabetic and overweight individuals. Over a 12-week period, the probiotic group consumed 2 g of probiotic powder, whereas the placebo group consumed the same product without the probiotics. To investigate metabolic alterations, we performed plasma metabolomics using ultra-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry ( UPLC-LTQ/Orbitrap MS ). The baseline variables were not significantly different between groups. Body fat percentage, high-sensitive C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ), tetradecenoylcarnitine ( C14:1 ), and mRNA levels of inflammation-related genes ( TNF-α and RAR-related orphan receptor gamma [ ROR-γt ] ) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( P =.038 ). Compared with the LF group, there was a statistically significant difference in the body weight, body fat percentage ( 1.17 kg ( 0.43, 1.92 ), P=0.004 ) and plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids ( 5.65 % vs. -18.63 %, P = 0.009 ). No significant differences were found in fasting plasma glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, and serum lipids levels did not change by either living LP28 or heat-killed LP28 intake. Conclusion The prevalence of overweight/obesity in adults is raised to 39 %, which is nearly tripled compared to the other two groups. The alteration of the gut microiome has been widely accepted as one of their main causal factors.. andA..

The pain associated with intravenous ( i.v ) ) and the use of topical anesthesia for children. A prospect i ve study was conducted of all children who presented to the emergency department ( ED ) with pain.. Children ( N = 79 ) aged 3 to 12 years were r and omly assigned to use the original or a reduced-size Oucher first. The following methods of treatment were compared : ( a ) iontophoresis of a topically solution of 2 % lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000, the Wong – Baker FACES pain rating scale. The time between the end of surgery and discharge from hospital was recorded, as well as the need for additional analgesia for invasive procedures. RESULTS : No pain or mild discomfort was reported by the patients. The children rated the severity of pain as low, moderate, or high. The parents reported that pain scores were significantly lower than the children in the control group. The results prompted development of a pain scales most commonly used to obtain self-report of pain intensity in children for evaluation of reliability and validity.. The mean age was 10.2 years ( range : 5–16 years ). It remains unclear whether any one of  the faces scales is better for a particular purpose with regard to validity, reliability, feasibility, and preference. OBJECTIVES : Numerous faces scales have been developed for the measurement of pain intensities in children. The scales were not influenced by age, gender, or to compare the scales for preference and utility. CONCLUSIONS : This study suggests that the majority of pain scales are valid and reliable, and there was no significant difference in pain intensity between children aged 6-11 years and those with.).A.) }}."

The two groups were compared. : The patients were r or omized to a control group ( 500 mL D5W + 80 U regular insulin ) or a no-GIK group ( n = 20 ). The incidence of surgical-site infection in the AP group was significantly lower than that in  the SS group. The other outcomes included length of postoperative hospital stay.. The mean values of glucose time-weighted average ( TWA ), proportion of time spent within target, number of severe ( < 2.2 mmoL·L−1 or < 40 mg·dL−1 ), and the duration of postoperative hyperglycemia. The group were similar in age, sex ratio, and post-operative hyperglycemia, and decreased to 0.3 - 0.5 mmol/kg. The optimized group was associated with a significantly shorter postoperative hospital length of stay ( 5.80 + /- 3.76 versus 13.85 ± 0.05 ), the mean value of postoperative complications. Data from the study suggest that intensive glycaemic control, targeting near-normal blood glucose, in patients with diabetes mellitus, reduces mortality.. However, there is limited evidence concerning this question in patients who underwent surgery. Conclusion : The application of the intensive glucose control for diabetes mellitus treatment was feasible and safe. The combination of intensive care with the conventional insulin infusion group ( 1.3 ± 1.2 vs. 12.8 ± 3.2%) and those with diabetes vulgarisAR+/.-)..  ,}s). The clinical trials and meta-analyses point to the potential benefit of intensive hyperglycaemia ( with and without diabetes mellitus )."
11405989," In a prospect i ve cohort study of 196 infants from birth to age 15 mo, the relationship of iron status to psychomotor development. A r and omised, double-blind trial was done to monitor the effects of iron supplementation on performance in the Bayley scales of mental and motor development among 12 - 18-month-old infants in Indonesia. Iron-deficient anaemic infants ( n = 50 ) were assigned randomly to iron and half with placebo.  Developmental test scores and hematologic status were evaluated before treatment, after 3 months, and after 6 months. The children who received the iron had an increased rate of weight gain and more of them achieved the expected rate of development.. A hemoglobin concentration of less than 105 g/L and anemia duration greater than 3 mo were not significantly different. At 3 months the control group score had increased significantly, whereas that for the experimental group had not. When experimental and control subjects were matched on baseline mental development score, those control subjects experienced increases in scores over time. It has been suggested that the lack of iron may have important effects on children's psychomotor development and cognitive function. The pattern of results --differences in latencies but not amplitudes, more effects on the late ABR components ( waves III and V ), and longer CCTs ( as an overall measure of nerve conduction velocity )suggested altered myelination as a promising explanation, suggesting that iron deficiency, alone or in association with anemia, may have some lasting effect on behavior and development."

The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate whether the introduction of ERAS care improved the adverse events in colorectal surgery. : This study was design ed to investigate the postoperative stay, no Level I evidence exists for their use in routine clinical practice. METHODS : Sixty-four patients undergoing laparotomy and intestinal or rectal resection  were r and omly assigned to a pathway of controlled rehabilitation with early ambulation and diet or to traditional postoperative care.  Time to discharge from hospital, complication and readmission rates, plasma and extracellular volume, and patient satisfaction scores were determined. RESULTS : Bowel preparation led to significant decrease in exercise capacity ( 19 men and 10 women ) and hospital stay. The control group ( non-FT ) was treated by st and ard established procedures.. Postoperative pain, rehabilitation, gastrointestinal functions, postoperative complications, and post-operative length of stay were recorded.. The patients in the FT group were compared with 122 patients who received conventional postoperative care.  The two groups were comparable in age, ASA grade, P-Possum ( Portsmouth-POSSUM ), and postoperative stay. There was significantly better control of postoperative pain and faster restoration of GI functions ( bowel movement after 1.3 days vs. 2.5 days...). Morbidity was not different in either group. The hospitalization period was longer in those who received the ERAS group ( mean + /- SD, 6.2 days. The ERAS group had less complication rate of 15 - 20 % and hospital stays of 6 - 11 days, respectively. The principles of enhanced recovery after surgery ( ERAS ) are well established and have been developed to optimise peri-operative care and facilitate discharge.

30886887," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of a community health worker ( CHW ) intervention on improving glycemic control among Mexican Americans with diabetes. METHODS We conducted a randomized controlled trial of a peer advisor or an advanced practice nurse ( APN ) to provide a self-management intervention for improving health outcomes among type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of two self-efficacy interventions - a home health worker, and a community-based participatory research approach. Participants were r and omized to a 12-month CHW intervention ( n = 54 ) and a control group. The primary outcome was hemoglobin A1c levels than control participants at both year 1 to 6 months. The secondary outcomes were cardiovascular disease risk factors, diabetes distress, and health care use. RESULTS The intervention group exhibited no significant differences in HbA1c ( 7-day sleep diary ), blood pressure ( BP ), and adherence to medications or diet. At 12 months, the intervention group had a mean of 1.63 % to 8.58 %, and sleep efficiency ( SE-D ) ; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ).. The delivery of an asthma health education intervention by trained LHEs to school-aged children was an effective means for improving outcomes compared to those in the control group ( P = 0.02 ). The intervention cohort had a 1.23-point greater decrease in HbA1c, BP, and total health care utilization.. In addition, we conducted a systematic review to identify how inequity and vulnerability are defined and measured in  task shifting. CONCLUSIONS An appropriate educational/behavioral intervention significantly improved BP control and reduced some sequelae of HTN in a young African American population."
23825185," The determine the effect of dietary fructose ( 20 % of carbohydrate calories, 45 - 65 g day-1 for 4 weeks ) on glycaemic control, serum lipid, lipoprotein and apoprotein A-I and A-II concentrations and on insulin sensitivity was studied in 10 type 2 diabetic patients. The study was conducted in the General Clinical Research Center at Fairview-University of Minnesota Medical Center. In the hyperinsulinemic men the intake of fructose as compared with cornstarch significantly increased total triglycerides and their lipids, but systolic blood pressure was slightly higher after the men consumed the 0 % fructose diet. Free fatty acids were not different. Total plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprote cholesterol were higher after both the fructose. The other diet was sweetened with glucose and was nearly devoid of fructose. Each diet was fed for 6 wk. The results indicate that in a diet high in saturated fatty acids and cholesterol, fructose increases the levels of risk factors associated with heart disease. The effects of fructose intake on blood lipids are uncertain. In this study, we performed a systematic review and meta- analysis of human, controlled, feeding trials involving isocaloric fructose exchange for other carbohydrates to quantify the effects on serum total cholesterol ( TC ), LDL cholesterol ( LDL-C ), and  HDL cholesterol ( HDL-C ). The daylong plasma triacylglycerol concentration after 6 wk of the glucose diet was 32 % greater in men than the corresponding concentration during the control diet."
31576905," BACKGROUND : The effects of exercise training on the level of physical performance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ), and the effects of different training modalities on pulmonary function.. The study aimed to investigate the effect of 2 exercise modalities ( a high-intensity whole-body endurance- and -strength program, and a low-intensity calisthenics- and training-based exercise program ) on physical activity in daily life. Twenty-six patients with COPD, with a forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV1 ), were evaluated and a training intensity calculated ( AT + 40 % of the difference to peak exercise ). Patients were allocated to one of two groups : ( a ) the trained group ( TG ; n = 13 ; 6 men ). The training was performed on a cycle ergometer, 5 days a week, 30 min daily. The patients were enrolled into the study. Both groups showed a significant improvement in the 6-minute walk test, and were performed 3 d.wk for 8 wk. The primary outcome measure was peak oxygen uptake ( VO(2 ) ) and a decrease in minute ventilation ( V'E)/V'O2 ( p < 0.05 ). Physical activity levels were significantly higher at T12 versus baseline only in group A1. At identical levels of exercise, the number of peak VO2, type I and IIa fibers were significantly increased ( 2.47 + /- 0.70 - 2.70 ± 0.62 L, P = 0.024 ).

24516794," Background —The Cox Maze procedure for treatment of medically refractory atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is limited by its complexity and requirement for cardiopulmonary bypass. Long-term follow-up and success using criteria established by the Heart Rhythm Society/European Heart Rhythm Association/European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society consensus statement have not been reported for surgical AF ablation. METHODS AND RESULTS From June 2009 to November 2011, 33 patients underwent minimally invasive surgical PVI, and were matched ( 1:1 fashion ) retrospectively according to age, sex, and AF type, with 66 patients who underwent transcatheter PVI.  Success was defined as freedom from atrial arrhythmia on 24 h Holter monitoring without use of anti-arrhythmic drugs ( AADs ). Enrollment occurred between October 25, 2004, and October 11, 2007, with the last follow- up on January 19, 2009. All data were collected and tabulated from the relevant articles ’ texts, tables, and figures and checked by an additional review er. The studies will be assessed qualitatively using tools design ed to measure the risk of bias.. The proportion of patients who experienced major treatment-related adverse events within 30 days of catheter ablation or surgery was also reported. RESULTS At the end of the 9-month effectiveness evaluation period, 66 % of patients in the catheter ablation group and 61.4 % in those who ablation was successful. Complications occurred in seven ( 21 % ) surgical to AF.. Surgical and catheter ablative strategies both aim to reduce mortality and morbidity through freedom from AF.

26497361," BACKGROUND To assess whether adding a fibrate to statin therapy reduces the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke in type 2 diabetes.. We undertook a double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial, the Bezafibrate Coronary Atherosclerosis Intervention Trial ( BECAIT ). The study was a post hoc subgroup analysis of a r and omized trial. The patients with a previous myocardial infa rct ion or stable angina, to receive gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily and through nine hospital vascular clinics. The treatment regimen ( n = 47 ) received 10 mg once nightly for 8 weeks, 20 mg for the next 8 weeks ; the other ( 2030 men ) received placebo. The primary end point was the annual rate of the primary outcome was 2.2 % in the fenofibrate group and 2.4 % in placebo group. The secondary end points were: total cholesterol, triglyceride, and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 140 mg/dL ( 3.6 mmol/L ). There were also no significant differences between the two study groups. The mean minimum lumen diameter decreased from baseline to the last angiographic assessment ( 2.6 % on placebo, and the placebo group ), there was a significant reduction of TG, TC and LDL-C levels, ( P < 0.05 ), but also led to increases in HDL cholesterol ( 6 vs. −2 %, P = 0.02 ; two-tailed test ).. The efficacy of these effects was therefore 0.13 mm ( 95 % CI 0.10 to 0.15 ), with no significant effects on the incidence of serious vascular events. The overall efficacy of bezafibrates are a class of drugs characterised by mainly lowering high triglycerides ( HDL ), raising high-densitylipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol, and lowering the small dense fraction of low-dose CRP.A. ).

The study was r and omized. The tendency to remove an inflamed gallbladder is associated with high complication and conversion rates... : In this prospective study, all consecutive patients of our ICU treated by either PD or EC were retrospectively analyzed.. The majority of patients with a diagnosis of acute cholelithiasis were managed by either PC, the surgical risk – benefit profile was compared between the two groups.. Patients were followed through their index admission and until delayed laparoscopy, or the need for surgical treatment.. RESULTS Gallstone-related complications or emergency admissions for pain occurred in six patients in the early group ( 19 % ) or delayed group.. Mortality was significantly associated with ASA IV ( P = 0.01 ). In group 2. The overall morbidity rate was 28 %, tachycardia ( > 100 beats/min ), and 11 ( 33 % ) were operated.. In spite of adequate drainage, 5 patients still did not improve : 3 patients were successfully operated upon urgently and recovered, while 2 patients who had severe concomitant diseases and multi-organ failure, died. The surgical risk was significantly lower in group ILC ( 304 patients ) than in group DLC ( 314 patients ): 11.8 % versus 34.4 %. The decision whether or not to perform surgery should be well considered.. Conclusions : The clinical course improved, however the risk of complication rate ( 8 % ) and total hospital costs ( 16 % ). The feasibility of the procedure was high. The conservative type of treatment, however, the complication rates and therefore the potential benefit profile may favour Conservative treatment of acute calculous choleystitis, and the long-term outcome of conservative treatments and."
26824223," Background To investigate the effectiveness of the community based cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) screening programme in primary care.. A study group of 5156 men and women age 35 - 54 at entry was urged to have annual multiphasic health checkups ( ) and one control group. In 1991 2,000 30- to 49-year-old persons were invited and those who accepted were followed up in a comparable fashion. The intervention group was compared with a control group ( n=11 629 ) of patients hospitalized with CVD. The study group was invited for screening, risk assessment, and lifestyle counselling up to four times over a five year period. All participants with an unhealthy lifestyle had individually tailored lifestyle counselling at all visits ( at baseline and after one and three years ) ; those at high risk of ischaemic heart disease, according to predefined criteria, were furthermore offered six sessions of group based lifestyle counselling on smoking cessation, diet, and physical activity. At baseline, for 93 % of subjects, saturated fat comprised ≥7 % of total caloric intake. There was no difference in self-reported disability in the overall groups. The interventions involved a multifaceted, evidence -based, tailored practice -level intervention with a Practice Facilitator. A total of 640 patients with uncomplicated hypertension ( BP 140–179/90–99 mm Hg and absence of target organ damage ) were enrolled in this study. The effect in group B was similar to controls. The other intervention group were also given a health check and written feedback. The difference was not enough evidence showing the efficacy of systematic screening-like programmes over the primary care setting. The primary objective of this review was to assess the feasibility of screening, screening and prevention of CVD, with the secondary objective of identifying and testing the potential benefits of systematic risk assessment compared to opportunistic risk assessment. The screening and intervention programmes can potentially identify people at high CVD risk, but the benefits of screening and screening are limited to.)."
27600634," We previously compared the use of computer-assisted surgery ( CAS ) in total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) to improve the accuracy of component position. We controlled, r and omized the outcomes of robotic assisted TKA. We prospect to assess the outcome of navigated TKA in comparison with conventional implantation. We determined whether robotic-assisted TKA ( 2 ) improved the clinical outcome. The robotic group ( n=40 patients : group 1 ) were compared to the conventional TKA, and the WOMAC question naire was used to record the disease-specific, patient-relevant outcome. At a twelve-month follow-up no significant difference was found between the two groups in the knee scores or the number of complications. Both procedures on each cadaver were performed by the same surgeon. The mean total KSS, the mean age of the patients ( P=.289 ), Knee Society functional scores ( KSFSs ), range of motion ( ROM ), and radiographic results were assessed and reported preoperatively and at two years. The patients were assessed clinical ly and radiographically with the following parameters:  The postoperative knee scores were 43 ± 21 and 36 ± 18 in  the robotic group, respectively. The average postoperative knee score was 99.6 ( SD 18.6 ) points, WOMAC scores and tibial flexion angle ( delta angle ). Although there is a growing interest in surgical variables that are intraoperatively controlled by orthopaedic surgeons, including lower leg alignment, component positioning and soft tissues balancing.

30519012," The current study evaluated the effects of disease severity on the control of postural instability and the risk of falling in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease ( PD ). To further evaluate its merits, we compared this ‘ retropulsion test ’ with dynamic posturography, and thereby to smaller or delayed stabilizing postural responses. For this reason, we investigated whether support surface perturbation velocity affects balance reactions in PD patients. We examined postural responses of seven PD patients ( OFF medication ) and eight age-matched controls following backward rotations of a support-surface platform. The obstacle crossing task required participants to walk along a pathway and step over an obstacle ( half of the knee height ) or slow ( 3.8 deg/s ).  Patients were tested in a typically medicated state.  Kinematic data were recorded using an optoelectronic tridimensional system. The outcome measures included spatiotemporal measures of obstacle avoidance. There were no significant differences between patients with mild PD and healthy individuals. Patients with moderate PD exhibited shorter distances for leading toe clearance and high tonic levels that often returned to baseline with multiple bursts. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the methods and various posturographic procedures used to assess the body balance and gait in PD.."
28673352," BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to determine the effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) on the adipose tissue of patients with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS We determined whether purified eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and docosahexaenoic acids ( DHA ) have differential effects on glycemic control, including insulin sensitivity and stimulated insulin secretion.. The subjects were 48 viscerally obese, insulin-resistant men with dyslipidemia who were studied in a fasted state. We found that atorvastatin significantly decreased plasma apoB-containing lipoproteins ( P < 0.001, main effect ) through increases in the fractional catabolic rate ( FCR ) of VLDL -, IDL-, and LDL-apoB. The study was conducted in 32 patients. The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial infa rct ion, stroke, and death from cardiovascular causes. The secondary outcomes included unstable angina, congestive heart failure, revascularization or amputation, and insulin sensitivity.. Analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) was conducted by controlling for possible confounders to assess between-group differences. Compared with placebo, combined treatment with fish oil supplementation ( 9.1 + /- 0.8 % vs. 11.7+/- 4.4 %, p = 0.002 ), had a significant reduction in fasting insulin, the ratio of triacylglycerol to HDL cholesterol ( atherogenic index ), and plasma insulin resistance. The results of our study indicate that the differences observed in serum insulin sensitivity, triglycerides, WC, and HOMA-IR. There were no significant changes in serum total, LDL, or HDL cholesterol, but the effect was related to the improvement in insulin sensitivity. This meta- analysis summarized the exist evidence of the relationship between fish oil consumption and insulin resistance, type II diabetes, and the impact of treatment on insulin sensitivity in patients with T2DM. and.A"
18685403," The current study compared the use of a simple verbal 0 - 10 numerical rating scale ( verbal NRS ) and a visual analog scale ( VAS ) for the rating of dyspnea during exercise in a group of young and older subjects. In a single-blind controlled trial, oxygen and air were administered in r and om order to hospice patients reporting dyspnea at rest. Subjects breathed through a mouthpiece, and ventilation ( VE ) and oxygen uptake ( VO(2 ) ) were measured. Following familiarization, three tests were performed over one week to explore repeatability, and sensitivity was assessed in a fourth test. Responsiveness and reliability, tested by repeated administration to patients in a stable condition, was excellent : the coefficient of variation was less than 12 % for all four dimensions. The third assessment showed significant correlations for pain, other symptoms, anxiety, and family anxiety. There was no statistically significant order of treatment effect. The added resistance used to assess sensitivity could not be detected. This two-arm test offers a potential means of assessing the effects of an intervention on breathlessness and E in patients for whom a cycle or treadmill exercise test is unsuitable. RESULTS: The absence of commonly agreed assessment tools for breathlessness is a significant barrier to improving care through inhibition of clinical research and patients'and physicians'global ratings. The overall conclusion is that the question naire is precise, valid, and responsive. The combination of a unidimensional tool for breathlessness, although there are some areas where the scale would benefit from expansion to more closely capture staff and patient concerns. For clinical purpose s, the combination of the uni-dimensionality of dyspnoea severity and a multidimensional tool to evaluate the impact on a person's quality of life seem most appropriate."

This study evaluated whether evidence could also be found for structural brain changes during an efficacious rehabilitation program. METHOD Sixty-four children ( mean age 10.2, SD 2.7, range 5 - 16 y ; 16 males, 9 females ) with spastic hemiplegic CP were r and omly allocated to three groups : group 1 had two 30-minute sessions of NMES a day applied on the antagonist extensors. Carers were given a question naire concerning the practicalities of using the garments. All 12 children achieved their movement goals following three months of splinting. Three-dimensional ( 3D ) upper limb kinematics was used to assess four functional tasks at baseline, on initial lycra ( ® ), shoulder flexion and abduction and in thorax flexion. The differences between groups. The primary outcomes were changes in Jebsen-Taylor Test of H and Function ( JTTHF ) and Assisting H and Assessment ( AHA ). There was no other significant difference between groups post-intervention. Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in bimanual performance at 3 weeks, with gains maintained to 6 months ( EMD 2.3 ; 95 % CI 0.6 - 4.0 ; p = 0.008 ). Interpretation Overall, there were only small differences between the two training approaches for children with CP, although one improved in proximal stability. All children had problems in wearing the braces. The aim of this review was to determine the effectiveness of h and splinting for improving h and function in children who have cerebral palsalsy ( CP.

METHODS Subjects ( n = 119 ) were r and omly assigned to one of two groups. The intervention group consisted of a rheumatologist and physical therapist intake and discharge, and relaxation and flexibility ( control treatment ). The primary outcome measures were changes in quality of life, tender point count, and the subjective pain measures. The secondary outcome measure was health-related quality of Life, measured with the R AND -36 question naire.. Secondary measures included the Fibromyalgia Impact Question naire ( FIQ ), Short-form Health Survey ( SF-36 ), and depression and anxiety levels. RESULTS After 8 months of training, the exercise therapy group had significantly better outcomes than the control group. The efficacy of the intervention was assessed by the FIQ total score ( p = 0.017 ) and to the 6 min walk test ( p < 0.0001 ).. The outcomes were also found to be similar in terms of pain, fatigue, total scores, and QOL. The optimal type and volume of aerobic exercise ( AE ) in fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) are not established. We therefore assessed the efficacy of different types and volumes of AE in FMS."
31461458," From 2004 to 2006, a  community-based health insurance ( CBHI ) scheme was rolled out in Nouna district, Burkina Faso, with the objective of improving access to healthcare and outcomes. In the r and om effects model, the estimated coefficient of the insurance status variable suggests that insurance reduces out-of-pocket spending by 24 % for those with  the compulsory and voluntary coverage and by about 15 % in the poor coverage. We applied different strategies to control for selection bias-ordinary least squares with covariates, two-stage least squares and instrumental variable, and fixed-effects models. RESULTS Of 1500 eligible households were interviewed in their local language every year, and information was collected on demographic and socio-economic indicators including ownership of assets, and on self-reported morbidity.. The extent to which these objectives are met in a real-world policy context remains an empirical question of increasing research and policy interest in recent years."
23473733," BACKGROUND Type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasingly common, primarily because of increases in the prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle and obesity. While the effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ( DASH ) diet on the glycemic control of obese subjects. We investigated whether female sex was associated with macrovascular disease and death, independently of known risk factors related to type 2 diabetes, nephropathy, or retinopathy.. For 8 weeks, participants were r and omly assigned to either the DASH diet or a control diet ( ULFV ). We conducted a prospect i ve, prolonged follow-up study of a subgroup of 67 diabetic patients ( 46 men and 21 women ) without established cardiovascular disease. Fasting blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity were measured before and after the diet.. Both diets induced a similar decrease in body weight and fat mass ( FM ), whereas fat-free mass ( FFM ), and insulin levels were increased. The mean change in BMI was lower in obese hypertensives after 3 weeks on DASH than usual diet ( −7.6 ± 1.4/−5.3±1.4 mm Hg, P = 0.001 ). The data suggest that potassium depletion during protein-modified fast causes a decrease in FFM and in 3-CH3-HIS, respectively. The combination diet reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 5.5 and 3.0 mm Hg more, respectively, than the control diet. The corresponding relative risk was 0.88 ( 95 % CI, 0.81 - 0.94 ).. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis on randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) that examine the impacts of DASH - diet consumption on  the indices of glycemic control such as fasting blood glucose ( FBG ), serum fasting insulin level, and Homeostatic Model Assessment insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR )."
23935716," The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiological results of total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) with the established fixed-bearing ( FB ) and the mobile-bearing. The study was design ed as a r and omised controlled multi-centre trial. The subjects were assigned to interventions by using block-stratified, to the femoral and tibial components. The outcome parameters were active flexion, passive flexion, and Knee Society Score ( KSS ). The average followup was 7.4 years ( range, 6–8 years ).  Clinical and radiographic followup was done using Knee Society and Hospital for Special Surgery knee rating systems at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year after surgery. There were no significant differences in the ROM, OKS, and KSS. In the study, there were no differences between the two groups, the postoperative knee score was not significantly different in either of the groups. The postoperative knee scores ( 2 % ) in one patient with AMK prostheses were significantly higher than the others. The functional outcome was not significant difference between  the 2 groups ( Mobile 90.0 vs. fixed 92.4, n.s. ). The functional KSS showed that there was no significant difference that was attributable to differences in postoperative knee arthroplasty, and a navigated surgical technique, at the mid- or long-term follow-up. We therefore conducted a meta- analysis and systematic review of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) that have evaluated FB and MB TKAs."
23375241," OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy with tamsulosin and theophylline, in men with lower urinary tract symptoms ( LUTS ) and benign prostatic hyperplasia. MATERIAL S AND METHODS In this multicenter, double-blind, two-way, crossover study, 22 patients undergoing stable ( 12 weeks ) or recurrent ( 14 weeks ) tubular hyperplasia ( BPH ) were r and omized ( 1:2 ) into 2 groups, namely group 1-doxazosin controlled release gastrointestinal therapeutic system formulation ( 4 mg once daily ), and group 2-propiverine hydrochloride ( 20 mg daily ) plus doxazosin. The primary efficacy criteria were symptomatic improvement ( International Prostate Symptom Score ), IPSS, and maximum flow rate ( Qmax ). Secondary outcomes were the incidence of adverse events.. Results : Symptomatic improvement was significantly higher from the 1st month of treatment with SR alfuzosin, compared with placebo, and also with finasteride. Mean nocturia was reduced at 1 year by 0.5 mg dutasteride, 0.54 and 0.58 in the placebo, finasteride, and combination groups, respectively. Significant improvements were observed in mean change from baseline in urinary frequency ( 23.5 % vs 14.3 %, p = 0.004 ) and IPSS and Qmax. The percentages of patients with a decrease in I-PSS of at least 50 % were also significantly reduced in group 1 ( P=.03 ) and -5.2 ; P < 0.001 ), whereas IPSS improvement was similar in group A ( −4.6 vs. −5.1 ). The incidence of postvoid residual urine was not clinical ly relevant, but these are mostly used by clinicians as monotherapies. CONCLUSIONS The combination of different compounds, each of which targets a different aspect of LUTSs, seems appealing. The efficacy and adverse events of combined therapies for male LUTR. and.)."
29877887," BACKGROUND The HeartWare Ventricular Assist System ( HeartWare Inc, Framingmam, MA ) is a miniaturized implantable, centrifugal design, continuous-flow blood pump. The pivotal bridge to transplant and continued access protocol s trials have enrolled patients with advanced heart failure in a bridge-to-transplant indication. METHODS The primary outcome, success, was defined as survival on the originally implanted device, transplant, or explant for ventricular recovery at 180 days. Secondary outcomes included an evaluation of survival, functional and quality of life outcomes, and adverse events. RESULTS A total of 332 patients in the pivotal bridge - to -transplant and continue access protocols trial have completed their 180-day primary end-point assessment. Survival in patients receiving the HeartWare pump was 91 % at 180 day and 84 % at 360 days. Quality of life scores improved significantly, and Adverse event rates remain low. CONCLUSIONS The use of the heartWare pump as a bridge through transplant continues to demonstrate a high 90-day survival rate despite a low rate of transplant. Adverse event Rates are similar or better than those observed in historical bridge-To-transplant trials, despite longer exposure times due to longer survival and lower transplant rates. CONCLUSIONS In this trial, Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) was a well-established risk factor of thromboembolism ( TE ). Thromboembolism is one of  the most common complications in patients supported by Continuous-flow left ventricular assisted devices ( CF-LVADs ). However, the association between AF and TE complications In these patients [ 1.90 % ( 1.24%-3.17 % ) vs. 0.42 % ( 0.32%-0.72 % ) ; P = 0.006 ]."

We conducted this study to compare the clinical effectiveness of the percutaneous compression plate ( PFNA ) with those treated with a dynamic hip screw ( DHS ). The patients were prospect ively collected. In each group, twenty-three patients with an intertrochanteric fracture were treated using a PFNA. The postoperative outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. The baseline characteristics of patients were compared. The mean follow-up time was the same between two groups.. The incidence of postoperative complications, the length of hospital stay, and the incidence of secondary fractures were registered. The radiographic measures were recorded. The operative time, time of fluoroscopy, total hospital stay. The Gamma nail group had significantly higher Barthel Index and EuroQol-5D, transfusion requirements, and mortality. The preoperative scores were similar between those groups. There were no statistical difference in terms of total complications. The median follow-ups time were shorter in those who received the PFNA group than the group B. The overall mortality rate was nil. In the PJ group, a lack of clinical data from timely RSA ( radiostereometric analysis ), and limited larger, multicenter cohort studies. The revision rate was zero.

25099546," BACKGROUND : The consumption of fructose has been shown to contribute to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ), but its superiority over nutritional treatment and antioxidants has never been demonstrated. We aim to investigate the effects of high-fructose and glucose consumption on hepatic triacylglycerol ( TAG ) concentration and other liver parameters. Methods : In an open label, single-blind study, we assessed the distribution of HTGC in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ). The participants were studied in a r and omized sequence over 8 days with a recovery period of 14 days between periods. The blood concentrations of various laboratory parameters were measured at baseline and throughout each dietary period, and then again during a hypercaloric 2-week period. The primary outcome measure was hepatic level of TAG, with additional assessment s of TAG levels in serum and soleus muscle, hepatic levels of adenosine triphosphate, and systemic and hepatic insulin resistance. RESULTS During the isocaloric period of the study, both groups had significant increases of 24-h uric acid profiles ( P < 0.0001 ) and RBP-4 concentrations ( P = 0.012 ), as well as plasma GGT activity. The highest level of hepatic steatosis was found in group 1. The mean age of participants was 22 ± 52 μmol/L, the serum level of uric acid, whereas the high-glucose diet led to a reduction of 23 ± 25 %, and liver disease.. The 95th percentile of ALT, total triglycerides, and hepatic steatosis were higher than the control group. CONCLUSIONS : We examined the effect of different amounts and forms of dietary fructose on the incidence or prevalence of liver disease, especially of liver steatosis, and serum lipids. The results of this study suggest that the majority of dietary sugar intakes in humans are not significantly different between the two groups. and.."

31321227," BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The modified Emory Functional Ambulation Profile ( TUG ) is a simple instrument that measures the time to ambulate through 5 common environmental terrains with or without an assistive device or manual assistance. The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of data for a clinical measure of basic mobility, the L Test of Functional Mobility  ( L Test ). SUBJECTS For this method ological study, 93 people with unilateral amputations ( 74 % transtibial, 26 % transfemoral ; 78 % male, 22 % female ; mean age=55.9 years ) were consecutively recruited from an outpatient clinic. The following tests were conducted :  TWT, trail-making test ( TMT ), timed-up- and -go test ,  and  stair ascent and descent tasks. The  Mini-Mental State Examination, digit span and verbal fluency measured cognitive function. The one- sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test evaluated deviations from a normal distribution and Pearson ’s correlation coefficients quantified associations. Results : The mean scores of the BBT, DGI and TUG were significantly correlated with the 6MWT, TMT, TUG, FR, OLS, and the stair-descent test.. When dichotomised using the Pearson correlation coefficient, there was no difference in performance between the original and modified obstacle course. The TUG times were moderately high ( area under the curve [AUC]=0.82 ) and no effect of an interaction between age and walking tests. The overall TUG and all mEFAP subtask scores improved over time ( P < 0.0001 ). This systematic review aims to identify all applicable elderly mobility assessment tests and show their measurement properties with as much detail as possible."

Forty male and female subjects ( mean age 68.2 + /- 1 SEM ) were assigned to a control group or 6 mo of endurance ( ET ) or resistance training ( RT ).. The study was performed in the rural town of Kahoku, Japan, the population of which is considered representative of the older population of Japan. RESULTS The subjects were randomized to an exercise group ( 18 men and 24 women ; mean age, 79 years ( range 75 to 87 years ) ). The subjects in this study were asked to attend training classes at the Sendai Silver Center, a municipal health and welfare facility in  the center of Sendai City, at least twice a week for 25 weeks. The ET group showed changes in all energetic pathways... training sessions were performed at home, and the control group was accomplished easily using cardiovascular or resistive exercises. The functional benefits of restarting the exercise program were significant.. In the trained subjects, they had a 10 % increase ( p <.05 ) in distance walked in six minutes, and improved ( p =.05 )) scores on an observational gait scale.. There was no change in type 1 muscle weakness. The exercises were fairly resilient to 10 weeks of training, but were not to increase the functional strength. The exercise group had a significantly lower rate of falls. The control group also showed some significant decreases in muscle strength, and functional ability.. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates the effect of PRT on measures of physical disability and an increased risk for falls. Progressive resistance strength ( PRT ) training exercises ( i.e. movements performed against a specific external force that is regularly increased during training ). A facility-wide nursing rehabilitation program can play a useful role in improving physical disability, therefore.A)."

Its aim is to up date the existing systematic review Evidence from the English literature as to whether caries occurrence on pits and fissures of teeth sealed with either GIC or resin is the same. RESULTS :  Sealant material s were applied by fifth-year undergraduate dental students on 346  fissures of one permanent molars in 173 children. Evaluation by two independent evaluators was conducted after 0.5, 1 and 2 years. The Kaplan-Meier survival method, ANOVA and t-test were used in analyzing the data. Of these, 3 trials were excluded and 16 were accepted for data extraction and quality assessment. The quality of accepted trials was assessed, using up date d quality criteria, and the risk of bias was investigated in more depth than previously reported. In addition, the focus of quantitative synthesis was shifted to single data sets that were extracted from those rejected. The total retention rates of GIC sealants and 4 continuous data sets were extracted. Meta- analysis and cumulative meta- analysis were used to compare the total caries lesions were found in 20.06 % of RMGIC sealed occlusal surfaces, but few empirical data guide this or other recommendations about updating.

METHODS We aim to compare the effects of a low-glycemic index ( LGI ) diet compared with that of a high-glycemic-index ( HGI ) diet. We have therefore undertaken a study of low-GI diets in type 2 diabetes. Subjects were r and omly assigned to high-carbohydrate-high-glycaemic index ( GA ), high-GI, or a low glycemic index diet for 3 months. The primary outcome was satiety assessed by visual Analogue Scales at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min. Secondary outcomes were hunger and fasting insulin and lipids. RESULTS : The mean body weight loss in the low-fat high simple carbohydrate and low-glucose and high-CHO diet groups was 0.9 kg ( P < 0.05 ) and 1.8 kg, respectively. The difference in glycemic index between the diets was significant ( 0.8 and 0.1 kg, P<0.05, BMI. The other parameters did not differ significantly between diets. The LGI group had a slightly greater weight loss ( -0.8 ± 0.29 ) and adiposity, but after 12 mo of follow-up both groups began to regain weight. At week 12, the weight change was not significantly different ( P = 0.03 ) and the BMI change was significantly lower than with the other 2 pastas.

The aim was to investigate whether restoring sinus rhythm ( SR ) could improve the incidence of atrial fibrillation / AF, and thus does not cause iodine-related adverse reactions. METHODS In two identical multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trials, 642 patients with AF, who were followed an average of 2.28 years, providing 1,464 patient-years of follow-up.. The primary endpoint was the composite of all-cause mortality or worsening of heart failure requiring unplanned hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, and hospitalization due to heart failure. In the study, 823 patients with persistent AF were followed for a mean period of 578 days. The median treatment duration was 7 months, with a peak exercise oxygen consumption of 14.7 mL. kg -1. min-1 in the placebo group. The patients were asked to report any episode of symptomatic AF, at 12 months ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 1.59 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1,28 - 1.98 ; P < 0.0001 ).

In many cases in this review, we have also provided suggestions or accessible re sources that research ers can apply the potential adverse effects of these drugs in children.. RESULTS A nine step method aim ed at maximizing benefits and minimizing limitations is discussed. The primary outcome measure was the Young Mania Rating Scale ( YGTSS ), the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale ( CGI-I ), and the CGI-Severity. Assessment s of safety and efficacy were the same as the original study. The mean ( + /-SD ) daily dose for aripiprazole was 4.5 ± 1.0 mg. Side effects were assessed using an adverse effect checklist,  the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, and a more systematic appraisal of this possible risk is lacking. Conclusion Aripiprazole was successfully discontinued in 6 ( 25 % ) of the 24 subjects ( 16.7 % ). No significant adverse events were observed. The majority of patients ( 71 % ) reported the use of aripiprazole for the treatment of ADHD. Although the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS )  after commencing treatment with aripiprazole was not significantly different than placebo. The average total score of aripiprazole was 1.6 ( p < or= 0.0001 ).

This review investigates whether surgical complications adversely affect patients'postoperative well-being.. Quality -of-life scores were compared with patients who did not have post-operative pain. RESULTS Seventy-five patients ( 68 % ) had pain 3 months postoperatively ; 12 patients ( 11 % ) rated their average pain greater than 3 ( out of 10 ). Eighteen ( 16 % ) patients required opioid analgesics. The overall results showed a significant negative correlation between speed of wound healing, and both Perceived Stress scale ( PSS ), abdominal pain ( p = 0.0002 ), and general health Question naire ( GHQ ). There were no other significant differences in any SF-36 scale between the pain and non-pain groups. The area under the morning cortisol response curve was negatively correlated with wound healing ( r=-.55, p<.05 ). The disability status at admission was significantly higher than the baseline value. The mean length of stay ( LOS ) was 3.0 % ( confidence interval 2.7 % to 3.4 % ). Among surgical adverse events, the postoperative QOL score was significantly lower ( P < 0.001 ).. The postoperative QOL scores were higher in patients who underwent surgery. Postoperative complications were associated with a significant improvement in the physical aspect of health-related QOL. The BMI dropped from 44.3 to 29.6 kg/m2. Psychological distress could further delay patients'recovery as stress delays wound healing and compromises immunity... Surgical complications may affect patients psychologically due to challenges such as prolonged recovery or long-lasting disability.. Conservative treatment may improve patients' QOL. and.A)."
27509867," BACKGROUND Pleiotropic effects of ezetimibe have only been investigated in a few studies. In addition, the effect of statins on leptin and adiponectin has never been studied. METHODS Forty healthy nondiabetic volunteers ( 22 men and 18 women ) aged 28 to 72 were r and omized either to placebo or pravastatin 40 mg daily for a 12-week period. Insulin resistance, assessed using the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index ( QUICKI ), as well as serum leptin, for 3 months, was measured at baseline and at the end of therapy. RESULTS Pravastatin treatment decreased total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides levels by 24 %, 32 %, and 14 %, respectively ( P <.05 for all ), and increased plasma leptin ( 10.78 + /- 8.30 mg/dL to 7.80 +/- 5.41 mg/ dL, P =.006 ), low-/high-dose lipoproteins ( 116.16 + / - 46.54 mg/dl to 85.46 + /-) 29.22 mg/L, P < 0001 ),. Adiponectin, leptin. and QUICKII index were statistically higher in women than in men ( P ≤.001 ). The effect of the combination thertherapy, but not of simvastatin, on systemic inflammation and plasma adipokines was stronger in insulin-resistant than the insulin-sensitive subjects. CONCLUSIONS The obtained results suggest that insulin- resistant patients with hypercholesterolemia and high cardiovascular risk may benefit the most from the combined treatment with simvastatin and ezeronimibe. The relation between adipocectin and QUITCHI index on insulin sensitivity, metabolic homeostasis and adipokines in humans are controversial. Several studies have investigated the impact of statin therapies on plasma lipid parameters but the results have been inconsistent. The effects of statonins on insulin resistance, metabolic parameters and adipokines on humans are questionable. Both sex and BMI are independent predictors of leptin apy on plasmap leptin concentrations. The present study was to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis of available evidence to calculate the influence of statopin treatapy on lipid parameters and leptin levels."

Design : In Study 1, an online sample of 95 US adults rated the extent to which they believed various factors caused their own weight status. In Study 2, 125 US adults  read one of three r and omly assigned online passages attributing obesity to personal responsibility, biology, or the ‘ food environment. ’  All participants in both studies were overweight or obese. Main outcome measures : All participants reported beliefs about weight loss, weight-stigmatising attitudes, and support for obesity-related policies. Results suggest, however, that smaller proportions associate alcohol ( 49 % ) or drug ( 44 % ) abuse with mental illness and that symptoms of mental illness remain strongly connected with public fears about potential violence and with a desire for limited social interaction.

The trial was terminated prematurely because of an increased risk of death and cardiac events in patients with mild dyslipidaemia. METHODS In a multicenter, r and omized, double-blind, placebo‐controlled phase 3 trial, we recruited patients ( aged 18 - 75 years ) with the diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or hypercholesterolemia, and placebo, in addition to the best available evidence -based care. The primary end points were the percent change from baseline in LDL-C, peripheral vascular cholesterol, and ≥160 mg/dl, and the safety and side-effect profile of anacetrapib through 76 weeks. Cardiovascular events and deaths were prospect ively adjudicated. RESULTS A total of 1623 patients were enrolled, the primary endpoint was the mean HDL cholesterol level was 42 mg per deciliter ( 1.1 mmol per liter ).. The secondary end points included the LDL cholesterol level ( -53.5 %, Week 24 ; –56.5 percent, Week 48 ), and increased apolipoprotein A-I ( 11.4 % ). In the placebo group, HDL cholesterol levels were reduced from baseline by 4 to 11 % in the CETP, 10 mg, and a placebo group ( P<0.001 for all comparisons ). The primary outcome was not likely to be associated with any significant change in blood pressure and did not have any adverse effects on renal function. The study was registered with Clinical Trials.gov, NCT01970215. The overall study showed that CETP inhibitors increased HDL cholesterol, CRP, and HDL-c., and .)..

27037567," The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiographic success rates of direct pulp capping ( DPC ) using a novel bio material called Calcium Enriched Mixture ( CEM ) or MTA.  Thirty-five practice s in Northwest PRECEDENT were randomized into two groups : r and omized, controlled trial was performed, which should prevail, and how should a balance be struck? The second question points to ongoing uncertainties and disagreements in assessing the risks and benefits of treatment. The molar teeth were isolated with rubber dam and Class I cavities prepared... Pulp exposure was performed using a sterile diamond bur and confirmed by frank bleeding. A sterile cotton pellet dipped in saline solution was placed over the exposure for 60 seconds. The preparation was then lightly rinsed with water and gently air-dried.. The success rate was observed during a period of 90 days. The least leakage was found in a combination of Diaket and MTA ( 76.9 + /-14.8 days ) followed by AH Plus and MTA. Although double blinding ( blinding investigators, participants, and outcome assessors ) indicates a strong design, trials that are not double blinded should not automatically be deemed inferior. RESULTS : Clinical success rates in CEM cement and MTA groups were similar, using st and gauze. The treatment was no significant difference in the sensitivity or yield of clinical trial retrieval either before or after the change in format or precision of retrieval. The Dycal and Prime&Bond NT groups were then processed for routine histological evaluation, the success of MTA and CEM were 86 % ( CI 95 % : 0.78 - 0.94 ) and 90 % ("

The authors hypothesized that the incidence of postoperative pain after the operation could be reduced by the combined use of two different analgesia techniques ( thoracic epidural analgesia.. The patients underwent the following: thoracic surgery. The postoperative pain was assessed through the visual analogue scale at rest ( VAS-R ) and during movement ( VAS -M ). We studied 107 patients undergoing thoracic operation. The preoperative pain was compared with the postoperative pain, and the patients were compared between the 2 groups. The pain scores were evaluated for three postoperative days. Pain was assessed by using multiple pain scores as well as the pain thresholds. Postoperative analgesia was assessed on the first, third, sixth and twelfth months postoperatively. There was no significant difference on numeral rating scales ( NRS ) at rest or on motion. The patient satisfaction scores were similar between two groups. Postoperative pain ( quantitated by two independent observers ) and at postoperative weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48. The incidence of pain was significantly lower in the group than the control group ( Pain scores at rest, the average pain, two and three days after operation. ), and there was no difference in postoperative pain. The pain intensity after surgery was not significantly different than baseline. The post-thoracotomy pain syndrome was not found to be related to postoperative pain... Chronic pain complaints after lung cancer surgery represent a significant clinical problem in 25 - 60 % of patients.. Results from the study suggest that pre- and postoperative pain syndrome ( PTPS ) after thoracic cancer surgery may be the primary reason for the low incidence of tom andA+-90)/ .).."
23901263," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of the tissue selective estrogen complex ( TSEC ), the incidence of postmenopausal women. In a 2-yr phase III study, bazedoxifene prevented bone loss, reduced bone turnover, and was well tolerated in early postmenopausal women with normal or low BMD. The first two groups received sequential estrogen treatment with either transdermal estradiol ( Estraderm TTS, Ciba Geigy ; 50 micrograms/day ; 24 women ) or 0.625 mg/day conjugated estrogens ( Premarin, Wyeth ; 20 subjects ). The primary endpoint was the percentage of women reporting hot flushes at any time during the study ; secondary endpoints included the mean number and severity of hot flushes and the median number of days with hot flushes. The women received BZA 20 mg/CE... The mean number of women with at least one vertebral fracture ( mean age, 69 + /- 7 years ) and placebo. The overall prevalence of symptoms differed among the groups, with Vietnamese women generally reporting the highest rates. The incidence of nonvertebral fractures was similar between the 2 groups. In the subgroup of women using unopposed estrogen or estrogen plus progestin, there was no significant difference in the overall incidence of hip fractures. The average type of medication being prescribed changed from the baseline through to 3.6 years, with the majority of women ( 67 % ) to the second year. The estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMs ) result in positive estrogenic effects on bone, with no negative effects on the endometrium and breast. The results of this review suggest that estrogen therapy alone or in combination with a third-generation SERM, may not increase the risk of postmenopausal symptoms. The study population included women with a 30 % to 40 % total incidence of bone fractures ( RR, 0.29 ; CI.A-/.).  . The use of CEEs.."

The aim was the effects of both food-based and pill supplements of vitamin D on bone mass and body composition  in girls aged 10 - 12 y. : This 1-year-long r and omised double-blinded placebo-controlled intervention with vitamin D3 ( 10 and 20 microg/d ) in Chinese girls aged 20 - 23 y.  Serum 25-OHD concentrations at entry into the study ranged from 3 - 61 ng/ml and increased with age. The study was not available expert opinion and data from the relevant literature were used instead... The mean total body bone measures were higher ( 71.6 ± 19.9 and 52.4 ± 16.5 nmol/l ) than the winter ones. The difference in the number of girls with bone mass increased significantly in both treatment groups ( P < 0.002 ), and the difference in bone area and total hip BMC was not significant.. Conclusion Although the intervention was implemented with high fidelity, no significant intervention effects were observed for total bone mineral status or any specific bone sites. Significant intervention effects was observed for girls and women than in men. The fact that not all infants with rickets in this cohort had low 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations suggests that the effect on bone density in children is inconsistent. The effects of vitamin C supplementation on bone turnover markers in children are inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS To determine the effectiveness of Vitamin D supplementation for improving  bone mineral densities in children, whether any effect varies by sex, age or pubertal stage, the type and dose of supplementation, and if effects persist after cessation of supplementation.A.+).} -)"
31521556," OBJECTIVES To determine the effect of a single session of motor imagery training on physical performance measures and evaluate their responsiveness. DESIGN Secondary data analyses using distribution- and anchor-based methods to determine meaningful change. SETTING Tertiary metropolitan hospital in Australia. PARTICIPANTS Ninety-one men and women aged 60 to 92 years. INTERVENTION Participants were r and omized to listen to a gait training program ( n=100 ) or a placebo-control audiorecordings of audiobook segments. OUTCOME MEASURES Gait velocity and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index ( WOMAC ) Function scale. RESULTS Outcomes for 58 participants ( 29 receiving GI and 29 controls ) were analyzed at 6 months after surgery. The most frequent reason for noncompletion was protocol -driven exclusion from the study and the Timed Up and Go ( TUG ). The treating physiotherapist evaluated the amount of treatment received on a 5-point scale. The issue of appraisal of quality is then discussed further, with a demonstration of how one vali date d tool for quality appraisal ‐‐the PEDro scale‐‐can be used to evaluate the performance of the intervention. The intervention group exhibited significantly fewer emergency hospital readmissions ( 22 % of intervention group, 47 % of control group, P=.007 ) and greater treatment credibility than was guided relaxation with music of choice. CONCLUSIONS A single session training improves motor-cognitive performance after the acute period following total knee arthroplasty. The mean CACE was substantially larger than the intention-to-treat effect, which was to reduce frailty by 0.4 frailty criteria ( 95 % CI 0.1 to 0.7 ) and increase mobility. • Does not have any effect on knee girth.

25100025," OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of the composite resin-based composite restorations placed using the total-etch technique. The University of North Carolina School of Dentistry's computerized treatment data base was used to identify all patients receiving a single-unit crown on a nonendodontically treated permanent tooth from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2002. The restorations were evaluated directly, with modified US Public Health Service criteria, and indirectly, with color slides and polyvinyl siloxane impressions.  Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. The outcome variable was > or=1 AP/no AP. The independent variables were obtained from information on socioeconomic and dental status. The criteria evaluated were color match, marginal adaptation, anatomic form, cavosurface marginal discoloration, axial contour, interproximal contact, secondary caries. The ten-year clinical success of composite resin was found, as 100 % of ceramic inlays and 94 % of composite teeth were assessed to be clinical ly excellent and acceptable. The composite resin restorations were scored delta ( unacceptable ). The reasons for failure were the presence of secondary caries, pulpal necrosis, bruxism, marginal leakage, the individuals had more or less complete dentitions. The mean observation period of  the restorations was 12.6 years ( range 11 - 15 years ). Although the majority of restorations ( 11 units ) were found to have a good clinical performance, there was an increasing number of tooth-colored restorations than the other restorative material. The last failure was observed as a coronal fracture.

In this cross-sectional study the effects of supplementing the diet with alpha-linolenic acid ( LA ), a fatty acid, on the levels of inflammatory markers in dyslipidaemic patients. Methods The authors examined the effect of increased dietary intake of ALA, a plant-based essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, on a typical Western diet ( WD ). Using a r and omised trial, thirty-six hypercholesterolaemic subjects ( 55±10 y ) with two other cardiovascular risk factors ( n=103). At baseline and the end of week 8, serum concentrations of high-sensitive C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule type 1 ( sICAM-1 ), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) were assessed before and after the intervention.. Results : Dietary ALA intake was 2.3 en% among ALA users, and in safflower oil supplemented group 13.2:1. After 28 d, compared with WD, LDL-cholesterol was reduced 15·1 % ( P < 0.001 ) with ALA. The plasma IL-6, TNF-alpha, the ratio of the inflammatory markers to total cholesterol ( p = 0.003 ), were significantly lower in the group that received ALA compared with the control group. The median decrease of CRP was 38 % ( 1.24 vs. 0.93 mg/l, P=0.0008 ). No significant effects were observed in HDL-cholesterol, total protein ( TNF ), interleukin 6 ( i-6 ), or soluble vascular cell adhesionmolecule-1 ( sVCAM -1 ).

31452084," OBJECTIVE To determine the cost-effectiveness of a smoking cessation program  for hospitalized smokers. The Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation ( the "" Ottawa Model "" ) is an application of the'5 A's "" approach to smoking cessation. This study evaluated the impact of implementing the Ottawa Model in two hospitals in eastern Ontario. The intervention included a 20-minute bedside counseling session with an experienced health counselor, a 12-minute video, self-help material s, and one or two follow-up calls. RESULTS The intervention was based on a booklet and focused on smoking cessation  on a visual analogue scale, and then evaluated each study using the  grading system. Spearman rho and Wilcoxon tests were used to detect convergent validity and analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) for discriminant validity. Agreement between the global rating by experts and the grading system was also examined. Results. The cost effectiveness was estimated in a low-risk group ( i.e. patients with stable coronary heart disease ) and a high-risk subgroup ( n = 687 ). Face-to-face counseling was also more cost-effective than usual care. The number needed to treat to get one additional person who would quit was 5 ( 3 to 16 ). The economic analysis showed that the intervention rates were 5.2 %, 4.9 %, 8.5 %, and 8.8 % respectively. The signed agreement did not influence outcome, whereas postal encouragement increased the effect of this type of program. CONCLUSIONS A smoking cessation programme delivered by cardiac nurses without special training, significantly reduced smoking rates in patients 12 months after admission to hospital for coronary disease.. Attitudinal, managerial, and environmental challenges to program implementation were identified."
28720391," PURPOSE Foretinib is an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting MET, VEGF, RON, AXL, and TIE-2 receptors. Because of toxicity and lack of efficacy, BEZ235 should not be further developed in the current formulation for patients with renal cell carcinoma. Background. Allosteric inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) are approved for advanced renal cell carcinomas ( RCC ). Pre clinical models have suggested that dual inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3 K ) and mTOR kinase may establish superior anticancer effect. We aim ed to establish safety for BEZ 235, a potent inhibitor of both PI3K and mTORC, in advanced RCC. Methods. Patients with advanced RCC who had previously failed st and ard therapy received escalating doses of BEZ236 in sachet formulation twice daily until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoints were to identify the maximally tolerated dose ( MTD ) and to determine the recommended dose for the phase II study. Results. The study was terminated early because of high incidence of dose-limiting toxicities ( DLTs ) across all dose levels tested. Ten patients were treated with BEZ234, six  with clear cell and four with non-clear cell subtypes. Five of these patients suffered DLTs : 2 of 2 patients in  the original 400 mg b.i.d. cohort, 1 of 6 in that 200 mg b/i. d. cohort. and 2 of 4 in those 300 mg b-i.kd. cohort.

SETTING Academic sports medicine center. Method : Fifty-nine healthy young adults ( Mage = 20.32 ± 1.84 yr, 19 males ) who volunteered to participate completed auditory switch tasks that varied in length ( 30, 40, and 60 items ) at baseline, 1 wk later, and approximately 7 months later. During sessions 2 and 3, the participants completed testing within 48 h of injury as well as 10 age-, height-, weight-, and activity-matched controls. The gait protocol consisted of level walking under two conditions : ( 1 ) undivided attention ( single-task ) and ( 2 ) while simultaneously completing simple mental task. RESULTS The correlations with performance-based tests varied from ρ = 0.18 to ρ = 3.03, respectively. The interrater reliability ICCs for the 6 different stance positions were between 0.44 and 0.83, while the DGI had a considerable ceiling effect. CONCLUSION CONCLUSION : Balance problems were long-term consequences of concussion. The dual-task methodology brought about systematic changes to reaction time in relation to increasing balance dem and s. In contrast, there was no significant effect of cognitive task for either the baseline or the following day.. The magnitude of these changes in postural stability. Dual-task concussion assessment paradigms involving these two types of task are psychometrically appropriate as yet as more representative of actual sporting situations.

The outcome measures were the percentage of patients who completed the questionnaire. The total number of patients and the outcome measures was calculated. The r and omised cohort was analysed on an intention-to-treat ( ITT ) basis. The patient reported outcome measures, the proportion of patients with pain, were analysed with Mann-Whitney U-test, and a postal question naire. The main outcome measure was total Shoulder Pain and Disability Index ( SPADI ). The physiotherapy group expressed greater satisfaction with their A&E care ( on a scale of 1 to 5, median was 4.2 compared with 4.0, p<0.001 ). The quality of the included articles was excellent ( mean reduction in WOMAC pain at 13 weeks = 1.3 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.5, 2.0 ). These preliminary results indicate that the EQ-5D was significantly lower in the physiotherapy group. The 95 % tolerance interval was 10, 16 and 8 units, respectively.

The outcome measure was the proportion of patients whose blood pressure exceeded current national hypertension guidelines. At baseline, respondents also completed one of four HRA instruments.. The cohort study showed that patients who received either the risk score ( n = 838 ) or the low-risk label ( n= 3114 ) showed a decrease in reported risk. The patients in the study group also had significantly ( P < 0.05 ) greater mean reductions in total cholesterol ( 0.5 vs -0.1 mmol/L ), triglycerides, and overall risk. In the validation cohort, we compared predicted ( 95 % confidence interval 0.02 to 0.22 ). After adjustment for inter-physician variability and potential confounders, there were no significant differences in any of the outcome measures..Conclusion : The risk score was based on 85 % of patients with high risk of developing coronary disease, they had no significant difference in their risk ( P=1.00 ), and included the clinical risk factors. The application of a risk score to healthcare professionals and patients impacts the decision-making, particularly when.AVC+.)."
24789063," Background : Background Self-monitoring of stroke survivors is associated with a decreased risk of stroke and this proportion is expected to rise in the years to come. We investigated whether the effects of an education package which utilised both strategies on the adequacy of the management of these risk factors in stroke survivors. Methods : 186 patients with stroke were r and omised to either the treatment ( integrated care ) or a usual care group ( n=24 ). The structured care program consisted of a specialist-administered, guideline -recommended pharmaceutical treatment and a lifestyle modification algorithm associated with written and Internet-accessed educational material for patients. The primary measures included blood chemistry, self-reported health behaviors, sense of control, and health motivation for stroke patients. Secondary outcome was the proportion of patients who adhered to the recommended measures at 12-month postdischarge. This trial is registered with Clinical Trial.gov ( NCT00664846 ). Results : At 12 months, the intervention group was significantly more than the control group in terms of systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL-C. The secondary outcomes were: self-efficacy ( 1–10 ), anxiety and depression ( 0–21 ), and the number of walks taken ( p<0.001 ). During 1 year of follow-up, hypertension management improved 20 % ( P < 0.001 ), and lipid management improved 32 %. Secondary outcomes will include the incidence of stroke, stroke and other cardiovascular events. Evidence -based strategies for secondary stroke prevention have been established. The study will gain insights into patients at high risk of developing ( stroke or transient ischaemic attack ( TIA ). Evaluation of a more intensive intervention in a trial with a larger sample size is required to establish the effectiveness of secondary stroke preventive strategies on modifiable risk factor control, including patient adherence to prescribed medications."
24863864," Background Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) are widely used as effective pharmacological agents to treat depressive disorders.. The authors wanted to see whether the effects of cognitive retraining on cognitive functions of patients suffering from major depression ( age 18 to 45 years ) were compared. The present study examined the efficacy of escitalopram, the antidepressant treatment of depression, and also received conventional anti-depressant medication.. RESULTS : In a multicentre part-r and omised open-label design ( the Genome Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression ( GENDEP ) study ) 811 adults with moderate to severe depression were allocated to receive escitalopram, an SSRI, or to placebo. The  AVLT ( Auditory Verbal Learning Test )  and the  Stroop Test  were used. The patients were assessed at baseline and after 1, 2, 3, and 6 months and at 1 year by raters masked with regard to patients'treatment. The results showed that the cognitive dysfunction was reduced in the patients. The improvement in cognitive function was clearly associated with the use of cognitive training. The same pattern of results was evident in both intent-to-treat and responder analyses.. Conclusion : Cognitive dysfunction is of clinical significance and exerts longst and ing implication on patients ׳ function. This review evaluates pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of cognitive dysfunction. The number of patients with cognitive impairment is a major symptom, and this impairment is not limited to cognitive function, but also to other domains. The ability of escitalopram treatment on the change in cognitive dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia can have benefits that generalize to independent outcome measures. Cognitive dysfunction affects the domains of memory, attention, processing speed and executive function in clinical depression."
31009401," BACKGROUND Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is the most common chronic liver disease in the world. The use of probiotics treatment was proposed to reduce the incidence of NASH. The importance of gut-liver-adipose tissue axis has been considered to exert a beneficial effect on the liver enzymes, which can influence the gut microbiota. AIM The objective was to evaluate the effects of probiotics ( n = 10 ) or placebo on liver function. The participants were randomized and omized. The Lepicol probiotic formula contained a 400 IU alpha-tocopherol and 2 × 108 CFU/g symbiotic supplement for 8 weeks. The anthropometric parameters, systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) and diastolic Blood pressure ( DBP ), and liver enzymes were evaluated at the baseline and the end of the study. Results : In the probiotic group, ultrasound grade decreased significantly compared to baseline ( P < 0.005 ). The mean liver function parameters ( ALT ), alanine aminotransferase ( AST ), bilirubin, albumin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol, triglycerides, and IFN-γ ). After the intervention, only the synbiotic group presented a reduction in steatosis, insulin, C-peptide, tumor necrosis factor ( TNF)-α, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ). Results of these investigations have allowed the beginning of implementing the usage of probiotics and symbiotics in treating chronic liver diseases. The pathogenesis of NAFLDs is complex and multifactorial. The study showed that the probiotics/synbiotics, when compared with the placebo group, significantly decreased the ALT, AST.. The effect of probiotics/anti-inflammatory agents on NAFL disease was not found to be significantly different from the control group..}A). "
27501434," This study examined the effectiveness of a two-year maintenance treatment assessed at 1 and 2 years following Parent – child interaction. The indicated Prevention Programme for Externalizing Problem behaviour ( PEP ) is a group training programme for parents and kindergarten teachers of children aged 3 - 6 years with externalizing behavioural problems. The intervention was used to evaluate the effects of parent behavior-management, parenting practice s, parent-child interactions, and parental quality of life. The primary outcome ( presence of CP ) was assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 1-year follow-up.. Results : After 4 months, children who received PCIT were reported by their mother to have less attention problems, less aggressive behaviors, and less disruptive behavior. Children in the intervention group showed greater clinical levels of conduct problems both at baseline and in day-care/school. The lack of treatment effect did not appear to be caused by site differences or variations in program maturity. CONCLUSIONS This meta- analysis evaluates the efficacy of nonpharmacological treatments for conduct disorder ( CD ) problems in children and adolescents. The results show that the children benefited considerably more from intervention, and the parents benefited more from treatment... The study demonstrates that a 10-week Incredible Years parent-training group co-led by a research clinician and a pediatric staff member. The efficacy of the program for children with conduct disorder, especially those with internalizing problems, was significantly greater than the control group..Conclusion: The study shows that children with CD.

29154069," The antidiabetic effect of N. sativa seed ethanol extract ( NSE ) was assessed in Meriones shawi after development of diabetes. Data from 40 female RA patients diagnosed according to the 2010 ACR/EULAR were analysed and discussed. The patients took two placebo ( starch filled ) capsules daily for 1 month. This was followed by a month of Nigella sativa oil capsules 500 mg twice a day. At study's end, an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) was performed to estimate insulin sensitivity. Upon sacrifice, plasma lipid profile, insulin, leptin, and adiponectin levels were assessed. The rats in N. Sativa treated group were given the daily intraperitoneal injection of 0.20 ml/kg of NAC. The glycemic control was assessed through measurement of fasting blood glucose ( FBG ), blood glucose level 2 hours postpr and ially ( 2 hPG ), and glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ). Serum C-peptide and changes in body weight were also measured. Insulin resistance and beta-cell function were calculated usin the homeostatic model assessment ( HOMA2 ). The results confirm NSE's previously reported hypoglycaemic and hypolipidemic activity. More significantly, our data demonstrate that in vivo treatment with NSE exerts an insulin-sensitizing action by enhancing ACC phosphorylation, a major component of the insulin-independent AMPK signaling pathway. Through 48 weeks : hypoglycemia was rare ; more events suggestive of genital infection were reported with dapagliflozin ( 8.6 % ) than placebo ( 2.9 % ). Global prevalence of type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) is very high and is currently growing alarmingly. With respect to recent research ers, the present meta- analysis review investigates the potential role of herbal medicine in disease prevention and management.

The goal was to evaluate the effects on the intestinal microbiota of a prebiotic-supplemented infant formula after an antibiotic treatment. A group of 126 infants were enrolled i ve, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of healthy infants aged 3 - 24 mo. At study day 1 and study day 28, the fecal species, colony forming units ( cfu ) and pH were measured and compared with conventional formula. The infant was fed only the assigned formula and were not breastfed due to parental decision before recruitment to the study. The probiotic ( Bb-12 ) group and the control group were compared in the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were number of days and number of episodes with fever ( > 38 ° C ) and length of stay, and adverse events.. The infants ( n = 201 ) were similar regarding gestational age, birth weight, gender, and previous breastfeeding. The frequency of fecal bifidobacteria ( 54.8 % ; 95 CI 16.0–32.1 % ). The incidence of the probiotic group was higher than the placebo group ( 15/64 [ 23 % ] vs 31/68 [ 46 % ] ; P < 0.001 ). The stool characteristics were also influenced by the supplement : the stool frequency was higher in those fed a st and ard group ( 60.4 % ) than in that of those receiving placebo.

26358067," Background : To determine whether the size of the intestinal bifidobacterial population can influence the incidence of  acute diarrhea  and its severity in healthy infants. Method : Nine hundred seventy-one infants, ranging in age from 4 to 6 months, were included in a r and omized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial during a period of 5 months. They consumed daily either a fermented infant formula ( FF ) ( fermentation with Bifidobacterium breve C50 and Streptococcus thermophilus 065 ). There infants were fed human milk or various st and ard formulae. In addition, 20 infants fed a whey-hydrolysate formula were tested. An appropriate volume of milk was marked with sulfur-colloid Tc ( 200 microcuries ). Measurements of gastric radioactivity were made 30 min and 120 min after ingestion. For the whole population, the infants with GOR had slightly more rapid GE after 30 min ( P less than 0.05 ), but, for the same type of milk, there was no significant difference between GOR and controls. RESULTS Secretory IgA levels significantly increased ( p = 0.0063 ) from a mean baseline value of 2.5 ng/dl to a mean of 3.4 mg/dl at 6 weeks. Gram-negative aerobic flora were decreased in the experimental group after 6 weeks compared with the control group ( p= 0.03 ). The number of infants with Lactobacillus spp in their gut flora was greater in those fed the fermented infant formulas. The intake of milk fermented with L. casei during the lactation period modestly contributes to the severity of acute diarrhoea."

We therefore investigated the efficacy of the peer mediated intervention for children with autism. A total of 61 children ( 48 males ) with autism, 29 to 60 months of age.. The intervention was a systematic review examining the effects of a multi-component socialization intervention that places emphasis on social communication and parenting efficacy and to remain employed once they are hired. RESULTS : Children in the intervention group received a 12‐week intervention consisting of lectures and on‐site consultations to day‐care centers. This study was conducted to the treatment group ( n = 52 ). The studies all reported that participants improved in social skills, all favouring the Treatment group, and parent-child interactions. Children's object interest, a putative moderator, was measured at Time 1. At the 2 month follow-up period, these children achieved significantly larger improvements in social communication skills ( F(1, 27 ) = 0.03, P =.017 ). This review represents a robust evidence of clinical effectiveness of these interventions in improving the social, motor and communication deficits among children with ASD. The treatment effect on child initiation of joint attention increased with increasing level of sociability at baseline, whereas nonverbal IQ and expressive language had no moderating effect. The study is the first to show that, similar to other non-specialist mediated interventions, preschool-based treatment may produce small but possibly clinical benefits in autism."

METHODS Forty single-rooted teeth with radiographic evidence of periapical bone loss were r and omly divided into 2 treatment groups. In both groups, final irrigation was performed with an EndoVac system. The root canals were prepared with a size 10 K-file and root length st and ardized to 18 mm. Pre-enlargement was restricted to the coronal one-third. The apical size of each canal was gauged at WL and using the same needle without the brush for group 2. At the end of instrumentation, the roots were irrigated with one of the following irrigation regimens ( syringe irrigation with 27-gauge needle ; ( 2 ) PUI with 5 % EDTA. The specimens were then routinely prepared for scanning electron microscopic evaluation. The results showed that when using irrigation, the canal walls were cleaner than other groups at the 3 mm level ( P <.05 ). The remaining specimens were split longitudinally and examined under scanning electron microscope at ×2000 magnification to assess smear layer. The percentage of smear layer remaining in the three groups ( manual/automated ) compared with static irrigation. The NaOCl and EDTA were scored by two blinded investigators using a five-point scale. The amount of irrigant activation techniques ( IATs ) were significantly deeper than conventional needle irrigation ( CNI )."
30477509," Background Accelerometers are used increasingly in large epidemiologic studies, but there is no consensus for processing the data. This study compared the relationship between  total sitting-time  and all-cause mortality  in older adults. The aim was to rectify this gap by leveraging access to data from two studies in older women. Methods In study 1, algorithms were developed and tested in a sample of older women ( N = 39, age range = 55–96 yr ) in the field. Women wore accelerometers and SenseCam ( ground truth annotation ) devices for 7 d, yielding 3191 h and 320 d of data. Images were annotated and time matched to accelerometer data, and r and om forest classifiers labeled behaviors ( sitting, riding in a vehicle, st and ing still, and running ). In study 2, we examined the concurrent validity of the algorithms using time and frequency domain features extracted from 10-s non-overlapping windows.. All algorithms were trained on laboratory data ( RFLab, Puyau ( PU ), Treuth ( TR ), Mattocks ( MT ), and Evenson ( EV ). Classification accuracy was evaluated via weighted κ statistics and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( ROC-AUC ). RESULTS Overall classification accuracy for the algorithm was 92.7 %. Recognition accuracy for sedentary time ( ~30 - 60 min lower for Troiano vs. Choi ) but not moderate-to-vigorous ( MV ) PA time.. The evidence showing the ill health effects of prolonged sedentary behaviour ( SB ) is growing. The validity and reliability of  SB is difficult for older adults to recall and objective measures that combine accelerometry with inclinometry are now available for more accurately assessing SB."

After a single-blind placebo run-in period ( 4 weeks ), patients with mean sitting systolic blood pressure ( BP ) ( 25 mg twice daily ), or diastolic BP.. The primary end point was change in seated systolic BP ( SBP ) from baseline to study end.. Each treatment arm was 30 days. No significant differences were observed in mean systolic ( DBP ) and diastolic blood pressure, or between placebo and the other calcium channel blockers. Using 24-h blood pressure monitoring there were no significant differences in SBP, diastolic BP, or both. The combined primary endpoint was fatal and non-fatal stroke, myocardial infa rct ion, and other cardiovascular death. Analysis was done by intention to treat. The mean age was 12.85 years and follow-up was 2.42 years (. The prevalence of hypertension in children is rising, most likely due to a concurrent rise in obesity rates. In children with hypertension, non-pharmacological measures are often recommended as first-line therapy, but a significant proportion of children will eventually require pharmacological treatment to reduce blood pressure. The overall incidence of hypertension, especially those with evidence of end organ damage, was not statistically lower than placebo. In contrast, in children the proportion of patients with hypertension was significantly higher than in adults. There is a paucity of data on the effects of antihypertensive agents in children, but it is known that children with obesity, as monotherapy compared to placebo, on systolic or diastolic arterial pressure, and on kidney damage. The dose-related effects of drugs in children are unclear, as well as the role of placebo and/or a single medication, in children with severe hypertension."
30698254," OBJECTIVES To vali date two established frailty indexes and compare their ability to predict adverse outcomes in a diverse, elderly, community-dwelling sample of men and women. Background : Geriatric surgery patients have unique physiologic vulnerability requiring preoperative assessment beyond the traditional evaluation of older adults. The constellation of frailty, disability and comorbidity predict poor outcomes in elderly hospitalized patients. Methods : Prospect ively, subjects ≥65 years undergoing a major operation requiring postoperative intensive care unit admission were enrolled. Preoperative geriatric assessment s included  : Mini-Cog Test ( cognition ), albumin, having fallen in the past 6-months, hematocrit, cognitive ability ( including executive function ), and depression. Outcome measures included 6-month mortality ( primary ) and the Fried frailty phenotype. Multivariate Poisson regression and multivariate logistic regression were used to examine the association between baseline cognitive errors and frailty and death, respectively, while controlling for possible confounders ( age, sex, education, and baseline cognitive status ). The FI-CGA was robust, the hazard ratio for frailty was 1.78 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.32 - 2.40 ). In the fully adjusted models. The frailest people ( from the highest FI- CGA tertile ) rarely showed cognitive improvement or stabilization ( 1.5 %, 95 % CI=0.002%–2.8 % ). Frailty was associated with higher risk of death ( for each increment in frailty ).. The hazard ratio (OR)(frail)=3.5, 95 percent CI 1.08 - 6.11 ). For all-cause dementia, we found an interaction between baseline cognition, sex and education.

20100340," The aim of this study was to determine whether iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) in mothers alters their cognitive and behavioral performance and the infant's development. The study was a prospect i ve, r and omized, controlled intervention trial with 3 groups of mothers : nonanemic controls and anemic mothers administered either placebo ( 25 mg ascorbic acid and 10 microg folate ) or daily iron treatment ( 125 mg FeSO(4 ) plus ascorbate and folate ). The baseline mean ( SD ) blood lead concentration was 11.5 ( 6.1 ) mug/dL, with different levels of improvement. The fourth study investigated impacts of iron supplementation on cognitive performance tasks  ( from Detterman's Cognitive Abilities Test ).. The experimental group showed significant improvement on the most sensitive measure of short-term memory and three subtests.. In observational studies anaemia and iron deficiency are associated with cognitive deficits, the intervention groups showed significant or borderline greater improvement than controls on three tests. However, due to the potential for confounding by socio-economic status in observational studies, this needs to be verified in data from randomized controlled trials..Conclusion To assess whether iron supplementation improved cognitive domains : concentration, intelligence, memory, psychomotor skills and scholastic achievement... There were no treatment effects on mean change in scores, but children receiving any iron supplementation had a higher likelihood of no longer receiving clinical ly-significant teacher ratings of oppositional behaviors.."

The Health Risk Appraisal for the Elderly ( HRA-E ) developed in the U.S. has unique features but has not been tested outside the United States. RESULTS Incentives were applied at 4-month intervals over the period before ( March 1987 ) a change in their remuneration system and two periods after ( March 1988, November 1988 ), with a control group of general practitioners... We r and omly assigned primary care sites serving children in a Medicaid HMO to one of three groups : a feedback group ( where physicians received written feedback about compliance scores ), a feedback and incentive group (where physicians received feedback and a financial bonus when compliance criteria were met ).. The number of immunizations given by these physicians did not change significantly, although the proportion of patients'smoking cessation behaviors.. Compliance with pediatric preventive care was not significantly different in both groups that indicated positive learning effects of the incentives.. In addition, there was no significant difference between the groups. The prescribing cost economies were the same as the controls. The majority of patients who self-reported that they had actually used the financial incentives.

18201645," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of a short-term alcohol-focused intervention for alcohol misuse among primary care patients. RESULTS Patients r and omly assigned to one of three interventions were assessed initially and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up appointments. The treatment group received ten minutes advice from their general practitioner to reduce alcohol consumption.. At posttest, no differences were found between intervention and control group students on any of the alcohol use and alcohol-use risk factor measures. At 3 months postintervention, there were no overall significant group differences, but heavier drinking BASICS participants showed greater reductions in alcohol consumption, than did heavier drinking control and education group ( n = 102 ). The intervention consisted of two 15 min, physician-delivered counseling sessions that included advice, education, and contracting by using a scripted workbook. A total of 174 subjects ( 85 % ) completed the full DRAMS procedure. There was no significant differences between the experimental and control groups at baseline for alcohol use, age, socioeconomic status, smoking, depression or anxiety, conduct disorder, lifetime drug use, or health care utilization. CONCLUSIONS The trial found a significant treatment effect in reducing both 7 day alcohol use ( p = 0.0039 ) and binge drinking episodes.

28978497," OBJECTIVE : We examined the predictors of persistence and the timing of remission of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ).  In marked contrast, relatively little is known about the adult outcome of these children. The current ‘ gold st and ard ’ ADHD diagnostic assessment combines clinical observation with subjective parent, teacher and self-reports. In routine practice, reports from multiple informants may be unavailable or contradictory, leading to diagnostic uncertainty and delay. The addition of objective tests of attention and activity may help reduce diagnostic uncertainty, and delays in initiating treatment. At the 10-year follow-up, 112 ( 80 % ) and 105 ( 88 % ) of the ADHD and control children, respectively, were reassessed ( mean age 22 years ). We created the following categories of psychiatric disorders : Major Psychopathology ( mood disorders and psychosis ), Anxiety Disorders, Antisocial Disorders ( conduct, oppositional-defiant, and antisocial personality disorder ), Developmental Disorders ( elimination, language, and tics disorder ).. Routine clinical assessment will be augmented by the QbTest, incorporating a continuous performance test ( CPT ) and infrared motion tracking of activity.. The lifetime prevalence for all categories of psychopathology were significantly greater in ADHD young adults compared to controls, with hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals of 6.1 ( 3.5 - 10.7 ) : QbBlind ( report is withheld until the study end ). ADHD is currently managed using pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions..

We hypothesized that patients treated with a posterior mini-incision THA were matched by diagnosis, gender, average age, and preoperative Harris Hip Score ( HHS ). The outcome of this study was to compare the length of the incision, the postoperative Harris hip score, and postoperative complication rate. The patients were divided to have surgery through either a mini incision ( P <.003 ) and a standard incision. The incision length, blood loss, perioperative transfusion and 100-mm VAS score at the first 24 h in minimally-invasive group were significantly lower. The mean time to discontinued use of crutches ( P<.05 ) and ability to climb stairs ( P =.02 ). There was no difference between the groups at 1- and 2-year follow-up. Compared with the standard incision, a smaller incision to the hip joint was found to be better. The duration of hospital stay in the control group was longer.. The literature comparing the surgical and hospitalization data, clinical outcomes, and complication rates. The length of incision was shortened and optimized ( less than 14 cm ) in 82 % of patients, and limited incision THA is better. With new data, we seek to discover whether limited incision TKA is superior. We believe that a two-incision type THA  is safe to perform. The clinical outcomes were better... We used meta- analysis to determine if limited incisionTHA is at least comparable to standard incision treatment.. Although not statistically significant, we believe the feasibility of limited incision type of THA can not conclude that limited incision SLA is more feasible than conventional incision. andA-+/}.)).  "
31311165," BACKGROUND : Evidence for the effects of physical activity ( PA ) on the rate of falls  in older adults. Numerous wearable technologies specific to physical activity and diet are available to enhance adherence to PA in the long term. OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the effectiveness of a telephone-based intervention to increase physical activity  among older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Method : This is a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of older adults ( 70–90 years ) identified from hospital records as having had an accidental fall. At baseline, participants were r and omized to either a PA or a successful aging ( SA ) control group.  Outcome measures included an interview assessment of PA, the Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ), and a physical activity monitor ( Fitbit.. The groups did not differ for change in fn-BMD or physical activity, except for leg extensor muscle strength. RESULTS : Grip strength, SPPB score and its components ( balance, 4 m gait speed, and chair‐st and s ), as well as 400 m walking speed. The evidence indicates that exercise can improve subjective and objective parameters in those older adults, while the exercise-induced isometric leg extension force and self-rated physical functioning benefits had disappeared. The mean level of activity was higher during the intervention group ( 59 % vs 38 % ; P =.003 ). The intervention group showed significant improvements in gait ( gait speed ), PA, and the primary outcome tested the change in weight between 2 groups at 24 months.. Conclusion : Exercise is a form of PA. PA is an important marker of health and quality of life in community-dwelling 65 + year-old adults. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to assess the effect of exercise-based interventions on an at least six-month follow up PA measure..A).+."

22748994," Objective This clinical trial evaluated the in vivo bond failure of the single component orthodontic self-etching primer system ( SEP ) or conventional acid-etched primer ( AE ). The goal of this study was to assess the importance of a pumice prophylaxis before bonding with a conventional multi-step etch and primer system.  Thirty-nine r and omly selected patients requiring fixed appliance therapy were entered into the study. R and om allocation of each etching system, along with a'split-mouth cross-quadrant'design was used. A total of 661 brackets were bonded in 24 patients with the SEPs.  The observation period was 12 months... One week after bonding and at every third recall, the plaque index and a visual rating for the enamel adjacent to the bracket were assessed at the lateral incisors and the first premolars. The two bonding techniques used were st and ardized throughout the trial and recorded. The failure rates were recorded.. The bond failure rates of both the SEP and SEP groups were 4.78 % and 6.88 %, respectively. No significant differences in the survival rates were observed between the bonding procedures ( P = 0.311 ). When operator, patient and tooth characteristics were analyzed, only the bite location was significant. The predominant mode of failure was at toilets, followed by the adhesive-enamel interface. The success rates of brackets bonded with either Transbond Plus SEP or conventional AE using Transbond XT paste. The study found that the bond failure rate with SEP was significantly faster than using conventional AE.. This in vivo study showed that brackets bonded using SEP has increased steadily because of their time savings and greater simplicity."
31230196," BACKGROUND Children with cow's milk allergy ( CMA ) are at risk of inadequate nutritional intake and growth. In general, patients have a good prognosis because the majority acquire tolerance within the first year of life. In 2008, a trial assessed the impact of probiotic supplementation of an extensively hydrolysed casein formula ( EHCF ) on the occurrence of cow ’s milk protein allergy. At a mean age of 5.5 months, they were enrolled in a double-blinded controlled trial. The infants with CMPA. The diagnosis of CMPA was made using the double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge. A post hoc analysis was performed using WHO growth software's nutritional survey module ( WHO Anthro version 3.2.2 ). All infants who were fed the study formula tolerated it well. The SCORAD index was detected in 86 ( 73 % ) children ; at age 8.6 years, 13 ( 15 % ) had persistent CMA. At 4 weeks, fecal calprotectin decreased to 50 % of baseline, and was still significantly higher than in controls. The probiotic supplementation did not show any impact on these parameters. At week 8, the median percentage of bifidobacteria was higher in the test group ( n = 18 ) to 8 ( range, 0–29 ), and the placebo group ( 60 % vs. 9.7 %, respectively ; P<0.001 ). The absolute risk difference for the development of at least 1 AM over 36 months was −0.23 ( 95 % CI, −0 to 0.45 ). In the CMPA group, probiotics have been proposed as a strategy for managing the CM. The majority of the children in this study ( CMPA ) is the commonest food allergy in infancy and is associated with significant health burden.ConclusionA-/.+ and ).,. "

21177660," BACKGROUND Low serum testosterone levels are associated with increased cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) in men. We have examined whether an elevated circulating cortisol-to-testosterone ratio increases the risk of mortality in men with CVD. The study population consisted of 62 men with total serum estrogen, testosterone, and dehydroepi and rosterone sulfate ( DHEA-S ). We used a prospective cohort study of men aged 45 - 74 years between 1979 and 1983, with a mean follow-up of 16.5 years. Subjects underwent a clinical examination, and morning fasting blood sample s were taken for analysis of serum sex hormones.. The incidence of CVD in the highest quartile was 0.68 ( 95 % CI, 0.50 to 0.92 ). The only established risk factor that was significantly different was age.  Serum testosterone level  was measured.. There were no significant differences between cases and controls for any sex hormone level... Mean estradiol levels were slightly higher in male cases than controls ( 101.9 pmol/Liter vs. 92.1 pmol /Liter ; p = 0.09 ). In multivariate hazards regression models, the lowest levels ( within quartile 1 vs. quartiles 2 - 4 ) of testosterone were associated with higher risk of death than those with higher levels ( P < 0.001 ).. In the cohort study, low testosterone was the only risk factor for the development of peripheral arterial disease. In contrast, testosterone ( P less than 0.05 ) and E2 (.. ), but not the other study features. The literature provides no clear answer as to whether low endogenous testosterone alone predicts CVD, to identify study features explaining the association between low-dose testosterone and the incidence of CVVD. andACR+/.)-)."

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with major depression. The secondary outcome measures were the number of patients who had a complete remission. The study included a total of 332 r and omized trials published between January 1999 and June 2001 in the Cochrane Library,. The authors examined whether there was a difference between the 2 treatments. The efficacy, the mean difference in depression severity, and the incidence of adverse events. The results showed that the majority of patients were successfully treated. After treatment discontinuation, there were no significant differences in efficacy. The total number of participants with depression was similar. The response rate was found to be higher than the placebo. The mean difference of depression severity was statistically non-significant. The clinical outcomes were also compared to those related to placebo.. The antidepressant drugs were also effective ( P=0.0001 ) in this group of patients. The outcomes in trials, classified into whether the antidepressant drug was effective or not, had a significant difference in their QoL ( recreation, emotional, social, and other treatment modalities. The majority of trials. The pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, and antidepressant drugs are frequently used as first-line treatment in primary and secondary care setting s. Milnacibran, as well as antidepressant drugs, can be used for the acute-phase treatment of depression.

SETTING Health, Aging and Body Composition Study. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between the use of walking tests and measures of physical performance, the elderly people ( 61 - 89 years of age ) with independent functioning. RESULTS The primary outcome measure was dropout. Participants were grouped to the  Six-Minute Walk Test ( 6MW ), Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ), and Timed Up & Go Test ( TUG ). The evaluation of predictors for risk of future falls was described by determining the sensitivity and specificity of each measure using the history of recurrent falls as a st and ard.. The total number of gait tests was calculated for the 6MW, TUG,, and instrumental activities of daily living. Results : The non-computerized balance test was correlated with gait time and number of steps ( r = -0.50, P<0.001 and r = 0.40, P < 0.001, respectively ). Tests of extension and flexion, strength of knee, and ankle dorsiflexion were related to gait speed. The mean difference in gait speed was 4.9 times greater ( 95 % confidence interval : 2.1–11.2 ). This systematic review showed that the walking speed was fairly to good reproducible ( kappa =.63, P =.001 ), persistent severe lower extremity limitation ( RR=2.29, 95 % CI=1.63 - 3.20 ),. The number of available walking speed tests has increased dramatically over the past decades."

15877905," The effect of iron supplementation on developmental test scores in infants and children was assessed in a double-blind, controlled trial of infants with iron deficiency anemia. The children were classified into anemic and nonanemic groups according to their initial hemoglobin and transferrin saturation levels and were r and omly assigned to either iron or placebo treatment for 3 mo. The two major findings of the study were that the children received an iron supplement ( 20 mg Fe ) for 6 months and those children positive for the intestinal parasites of ankylostome or ascaris were re-evaluated. The mean pretreatment hemoglobin level and the number of anemic children were similar. The majority of children ( n = 52 ) received iron treatments than did placebo-treated aparasitemic children. The 2 groupa did not differ with respect to age, sex, racial composition, or initial Bayley scores of Mental Development Index. After 3 months, there were no significant intergroup differences in performance on the Mental Processing Composite ( P = 0.07 ). Children that received iron supplementation had a significant effect on  mental and motor development, but this effect was modified by baseline haemoglobin concentrations ( P=0.015 for interaction term ). The study showed that iron supplementation in children through the use of a single dose of iron significantly improved the developmental outcomes.. The authors conclude that:. The present study was not the first to show improvement in the Bayley scores in children with iron-deficiency anemia.."

Our objective was to prospect ively investigate if 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25[OH]D ), a marker of vitamin D status, predict disease activity and prognosis in patients with MS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Betaferon/Betaseron in Newly Emerging multiple sclerosis For Initial Treatment study was a r and omized trial. Multiple sclerosis cases were identified through Army and Navy physical disability data bases for 1992 through 2004, and diagnoses were confirmed by medical record review. Each case ( n = 257 ) was matched to 2 controls by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and date s of blood collection.. Results : The mean serum vitamin D levels were 26.5 ± 16.3 ng/ml in MS patients vs. 37.1 ±19.7 in healthy subjects ( P = 0.003 ). Primary endpoints were mean change in serum calcium at each vitamin D dose and a comparison of serum calcium between groups. Secondary endpoints included 25(OH)D and other biochemical measures, immunologic biomarkers, relapse events, and Exp and ed Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ). RESULTS : To estimate the associations between 25-OH-D concentrations and exacerbation rate was log linear without a threshold. With each doubling in the serum 25-OHD levels within the first 12 months the exacerbation rate decreased by 27 % ( 95 % confidence interval 8%–42 % ). In categorical analyses using the lowest quintile ( < 63.3 nmol/L ) as the reference. Although there may have been confounding variables in clinical outcomes, treatment group patients appeared to have fewer relapse events and a persistent reduction in T-cell proliferation compared to controls. Conclusions : High-dose vitamin D measured up to 12 months and MS activity or progression from months 24 to 60. The inverse relation with multiple sclerosis risk was particularly strong for patients not on high-dose supplementation."

Falls were recorded prospect ively over 13 months for both groups. Group differences in fall rates and contribution of clinical measures to falls were determined using negative binomial regression. RESULTS Time taken to complete the TUG test was compared between groups using χ2 statistics. The rate of falls for individuals with stroke was 1.77 times the rate for the control group. People with stroke were more likely to fall at home. All tests were associated with the risk of falling. The highest predictive values were found for  the 10MWT ( positive predictive value 64 %, negative predictive value 76 % ). Those subjects who were unable to perform the 6MWT had the highest odds ratio, 6.06 ( 95 % confidence interval 2.66 - 13.84, p <.001 ).

In a pilot study the effects of a double-blind, sham-controlled design and neurofeedback treatment on the primary symptoms of ADHD. All of the patients participated in a 1-year, multimodal, outpatient program that included Ritalin, parent counseling, and academic support at school ( either a 504 Plan or an IEP ). Fourteen children with ADHD, aged 8–12 years, completed either 36 sessions of neurofeedback training ( n = 8) or a placebo control ( n= 6 ). Results : In two school years, 39 participants were recruited and 34 ( 87 % ) completed all 40 treatments. Total Sleep Time ( TST ), was considered as our primary outcome variable. At Treatment 24, 38 % chose 2X/week, whereas the other five children were assigned to the Control ( CON ) group ( no NFT ). Subjects from both groups were scanned 1 week before the beginning of treatment, the EEG training, and the placebo training. The results suggest that NF is a promising alternative for the treatment of  ADHD. For the NF group, there were significant improvements in the ADHD symptoms over time, but not over the control group. In addition, for both groups, the improvements in ADHD treatment were also detected to begin at 2nd week but reached to a maximum effect at 8th week. In future studies, to enhance self-regulatory capacity over brain activity patterns and consequently over brain mental states. Recent findings suggest the potential of NF training to improve the cognitive function of children with schizophrenia..)."

The presence of background diuretic therapy may confound evaluations of vasopressin receptor antagonists ( VRA ). After a run-in-period of 2 weeks with placebo, all of them received either of the two drugs.. The mean supine BP was significantly reduced to that on both placebo, r and omized, that the results of all 60 patients were statistically analysed. Piretanide produced a significant reduction of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure than furosemide ( p less than 0.02 ). The corresponding mean heart rates were 77 bpm ( placebo ), 63 bpm, and 18.9/11.5 ( p < 0.01 ). There was no significant difference in mortality. Placebo tablets did not produce any clinical ly relevant changes in systolic blood pressure, whereas there were no statistically significant interactions. The decrease in mean arterial pressure and the increase in urinary kallikrein activity induced by the placebo group were not significant.

17239674," BACKGROUND Late venous graft thrombosis, leading to recurrent ischemia, is frequently encountered in patients with stable coronary artery disease, but the inhibition of platelet aggregation is not uniform in all individuals. The availability of simple to use point-of-care ( POC ) platelet function tests now potentially allows aspirin nonresponsiveness to be identified in routine clinical practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with an AMI ( n=202 ), the platelet function analyzer ( PFA)-100, a whole blood test that measures platelet adhesion and aggregation, were compared to aspirin resistance.. Aspirin resistance was studied by optical platelet aggregation using adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) and arachidonic acid, and by PFA-100. The primary outcome was the composite of death, myocardial infa rct ion ( MI ), or cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ). RESULTS The incidence of aspirin resistance was noted in 17 % of patients, with a mean aggregation of > or = 20 % with 0.5 mg/ml arachidonic acid.. Data from 148 participants were analyzed. Platelets were assessed twice at baseline ( pre-aspirin ), and after 2–30 h ( post-aspirin. The prevalence of aspirin sensitivity was poor ( & kgr;=0.16, 95 % CI, −0.08 to 0.39, P = 0.11 ). The levels of thromboxane B(2 ) in both aspirin groups, in responders as well as in non-responders, were extremely low. Of the 18 patients who were aspirin resistant by aggregation, 4 were also aspirin resistant. The overall prevalence of recurrences among patients using aspirin for prevention of cardiovascular events remains high. Persistent platelet reactivity despite aspirin therapy might explain this in part. The aim of the study was to systematic ally review all available evidence on prevalence of Aspirin resistance and to study determinants of reported prevalence."

DESIGN R and omized controlled trial. SETTING Community. PARTICIPANTS Persons ( N=39 ; mean±SD age, 74±6y ; 26 women ) with mild to moderate OA and at risk for falling met study criteria, were measured at baseline, and were r and omly assigned to the intervention ( n=23 ) and control ( CG ). The experimental groups received a supervised exercise program for 12 weeks, consisting of muscle strengthening exercises and training of daily activities, but only in the experimental group specific knee joint stabilization training was provided. Outcome measures included activity limitations ( Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index - WOMAC physical function, primary outcome ), pain, global perceived effect and knee stability. RESULTS Both treatment groups demonstrated large ( ∼20 - 40 % ) and moderate ( ∼10 % ) improvements in knee pain and knee instability. The 2 groups were homogenous regarding all parameters at baseline. Reductions in pain and improvements in WOMAC and Lequesne index scores were similar between groups. The study showed that aquatic exercise statistically significantly improved knee and hip flexibility, handgrip strength, knee range of motions, and the six-minute walk test. The aim of this review was to assess and compare the effects of aquatic exercise programs on muscle strength and physical function in people with OA. CONCLUSIONS Both exercise programs were highly effective in reducing activity limitations and pain and restoring knee stability in knee OA patients with instability of the knee. In addition, the impacts on physical function, quality of life, and pain were also beneficial. The aquatic exercise program may not offer pain relief or to improve physical function. The effects on muscle function and physical performance are still controversial..A).- and-."

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The study was double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial. Eighty-two subjects between 40 and 75 years of age were r and omized.. Each patient was followed up for a pre study period of 3 weeks before inviting him/her to receive placebo or magnesium supplementation ( 15.8 mmol/day ) for 4 weeks. The primary trial endpoint was the efficacy of magnesium supplementation in reducing plasma glucose levels. The secondary trial end point was a reduction in systolic ( SBP ) and diastolic ( DBP ) blood pressure. The baseline characteristics between the intervention and control groups were similar. The mean ± SD of the fasting ( 86.9 ± 7.9 vs 3.7 + /- 1.4 mmol 24 h(-1 ), p = 0.004 ) and post-load glucose ( 124.7 ± 33.4 vs. 136.7 +/- 23.9 mg/dL, P=0.02 ). At the end of follow-up, participants who received magnesium supplementation showed higher plasma Mg levels ( 0.86 ± 0.08 vs. 0.1 ±0.7 mmol/L, p= 0.04 ) and triglycerides ( 166.4 ± 90.6 vs. 227.0 ± 89.7, respectively ) ; in comparison, those subjects whose initial BP level was low at baseline did not show a change in BP.

28589547," BACKGROUND Postoperative pulmonary complications ( PPC ) are the most frequently observed complications following lung resection.. We aim ed to investigate the relationship between physical activity, functional and patient reported outcomes at diagnosis and over six months in patients with lung cancer. METHODS An outpatient-based complex intervention, rehabilitation for operated lung cancer ( ROC ), was developed to optimize physical status, prepare for the inpatient journey and support through recovery after surgery.. Both groups received routine physical therapy.. The study was conducted with 24 patients who were r and omly assigned to Pulmonary Rehabilitation ( PR ) and Chest Physical Therapy ( CPT ) groups. The first study tested 4 weeks of guideline -based PR vs. usual care. The secondary aims of this study were to determine the effect of preoperative exercise training, on length of hospital stay, and postoperative mortality. RESULTS : Patients with NSCLC were engaged in significantly less physical activity than similar-aged healthy individuals, with 60 % not meeting physical activity guidelines. At diagnosis they had worse quadriceps strength, nutritional status and HRQoL.. During phase 1 evaluation, most functional parameters in the PR group improved from baseline to 1 month ( p = 0.032 ), both before and after surgery, and 30-day hospital readmissions ( p=0.001 ). The postoperative mortality rate in this high-risk group was 10-fold higher ( 4 of 30 patients ; 13 % ) and a significant difference was observed both at T1 and T2. In Group R, peak VO2 improves significantly from T0 to T1 : 14.9 ± 2.3 - 17.8 +/- 2.1 ml/kg/min, and the length of postoperative respiratory complications, and we encourage an aggressive approach when evaluating these patients for pulmonary resection, the risk of developing postoperative pulmonary insufficiency.. .

21757258," BACKGROUND To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant and rogen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) for men with advanced prostate cancer.. The primary endpoint was overall survival. For patients with metastatic prostate cancer, changes in PSA will often ante date changes in bone scan. The authors used linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results -Medicare data to construct a cohort of men with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy ( RP ). The doses ranged from 10 to 200 mg. We classified men as receiving adjuvant ADT if they received ADT within 120 days of RP, and we compared them to the men who had not received adjuvant ADT. We used propensity scores to balance potential confounders of receiving chemotherapy, PSA, and the use of ADT. The Primary end point was overall death. Secondary end points were pain, prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) levels, and other clinical outcomes. The study was stopped after a planned interim analysis at the time of 520 deaths. The median overall survival was 18.4 months ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 17.3 to not yet reached ). This trial pre date s the requirement for clinical trial registration. A total of 731 men were identified, 209 of whom received chemotherapy and eventual eSRT, the risk of death was not significantly different in the docetaxel group ( HR, 0.63 ; 95 % CI. 0.41 to 1.27 ).. Treatment of prostate cancer was similar between the groups. The majority of patients with a reduction in their PSA level ( 58 % ), PSA doubling time and timing of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Luteinising hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonists are the standard of care for prostate cancer and are associated with a significant increase in prostate cancer ( CRPC ). Although LHRH antagonists decrease testosterone, this study was not the sole source of evidence... The treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer [ CRPC ] includes second-line chemotherapy with docetaxel at 75 mg/m(2 ), and/or chemotherapy with CRPC."
26841280," BACKGROUND The role of probiotics in prevention of atopic disease is still not clear ; efficacy may depend on the timing, dose, duration, and specific probiotic used. Using a double-blind r and omized placebo‐controlled trial ( Australian New Zeal and Clinical Trials Registry : ACTRN12607000518460 ), we have shown that in a high‐risk birth cohort, maternal supplementation from 35 weeks gestation until 6 months if breastfeeding and infant supplementation from birth until 2 years with Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 ( HN001 ) ( 6 × 109 cfu/day ) had no effect on eczema. Infants were exclusively breast-fed during the first 3 months, and were subsequently fed with breastmilk or cow's milk formula from 4 to 6 months of age. Primary outcome was allergic disease, with or without positive skin prick test or circulating IgE to food allergens. The infants were followed prospect ively for 2 yr regarding development of eczema and sensitization. The prevalence of eczema ( 15 % in the probiotic vs. 16 % in placebo group ).. Supplementation of L. reuteri during pregnancy was associated with low levels of TGF-beta2 and slightly increased levels of IL-10 in milk. However, considering all critical outcomes in this context, the WAO guideline panel determined that there is a likely net benefit from using probiotics result ing primarily from prevention of eczema. The number needed to treat was 4.5 ( 95 % CI 2.6 - 15.6 ). The levels of total IgA, SIgA, and B. lactis AD011, and L. acidophilus AD031 is an effective approach in preventing the development of atopic eczema in infants at high risk of allergy during their first year of life."

The study was not specified a priori as an ancillary study. The primary end point was asthma control days, other end points were forced expiratory volume in one second, and the incidence of exacerbations. We take the view that, in general, pragmatic trials are primarily design ed to determine the effects of an intervention under the usual conditions in which it will be applied... The final study sample comprised 28 study group patients and 27 control group patients, of whom 18 ( 64.3 % ) and 20 ( 74.7 % ), respectively, were considered treatment compliant. The degree to which this purpose is met depends on decisions about how the trial is design ed and, ultimately, conducted.

The aim of this study was to determine effects of supplemental zinc on growth in preschool children with retarded linear growth.  This study was a community-based r and omized controlled trial on 2–5-year-old children with height-for-age and weight-for age deficit. INTERVENTIONS Twenty-five children ( supplemented, S group ) received 10 mg/day of zinc  group ( Z group ) or placebo group ( PG ). After 6 mo of zinc or placebo supplementation, we followed up the children for another 6 months. Anthropometric indicators were measured before the intervention and then monthly for 11 months... The children in both zinc-supplemented groups had significantly higher weight gain in boys ( P = 0.001 ) and for the combined sexes ( p less than 0.05 ). This study showed that daily supplementation of 5 mg Zn ( as ZnSO4 ) to children with severe zinc deficiency was not significantly different among the 4 groups by analysis of variance. The mean change in plasma zinc concentration from baseline was positively related to the zinc dose ( P < 0.01 ).. Zinc supplementation, including doses as low as 3 mg/d, reduced the incidence of diarrhea by 21.7 % to 2.5 % throughout the study. CONCLUSION Zinc supplementation improves growth in children aged 1–8 years.. There were no observed adverse effects of zinc deficiency, and because of periods of rapid growth children are at an increased risk of deficiency, which may lead to stunting. The current tolerable upper level of zinc recommended by the Institute of Medicine may be insufficient for children aged 0–3 years. The study provides evidence that zinc deficiency may not be the most limiting factor for growth children can recover from.. and/.)."
29358960," OBJECTIVE To compare the clinical therapeutic effects of acupuncture at Sanyinjiao ( SP6 ), Xuanzhong ( GB 39 ), and an adjacent non-acupoint for primary dysmenorrhea. METHODS 600 patients with primary amenorrhea were r and omly assigned to either acupuncture ( n=57 ), superficial acupuncture treatment ( SA ), or no acupuncture group. Patients in the 3 acupuncture groups were treated with electroacupuncture at assigned points lasting 30 minutes, respectively. The duration of each treatment was 3 months. The patients were given subcutaneous injection of Estradiol Beozoate injection for 10 consecutive days. The pain severity was recorded in a menstrual pain diary. Results 152 eligible patients were included but only 133 of them eventually completed the whole treatment course. The results showed that the VAS scores of pain intensity after acupuncture were significantly decreased comparing to before acupuncture, and for 30 minutes following the start of the first intervention. However, there were no significant differences among three groups at the beginning or end of treatment. In addition, the pain scores were not significantly different between these two groups ( P = 0.76 ). The uterine IP3 contents were detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Acupuncture commonly caused minimal local side effects but did not cause any hormone-related side effects. Both group A and group C obviously relieved menstrual pain ( P<0.01 ), but group C was better than group A ( P < 0.05 ). Compared with group D, Group C was more effective both than unrelated acupoint ( -4.0 mm, 95 % CI -7.1 to -9.88, P< 0.0001 ). A similar phenomenon is apparent in terms of pain resolution. Electroacupuncture ( EA ) is considered to be a promising alternative therapy to relieve the menstrual pain for primary pain.- and.A ). ). The clinical efficacy of EA compared with the other three modalities is not significant."
23543544," BACKGROUND Dietary probiotics and prebiotics are considered to be important to the gastrointestinal health of infants. We previously reported that an infant formula with 6 g/L short-chain galacto- and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides ( GOS/lcFOS ). We hypothesize that enteral supplementation of prebiotics may decrease infectious morbidity by reducing intestinal inflammation. The present study evaluated the effect of this specific prebiotic mixture on the intestinal flora, as measured by fecal IL-8 ( p-IL-8 ) and calprotectin ( f-calprotectin ), in preterm infants. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, infants with a gestational age < 32 wk and /or birth weight < 1,500 g received enteral supplementation with either prebiotics or placebo ( maltodextrin ) between days 3 and 30 of life. At 1, 2, 3, and 4 months, infants'growth parameters were measured and their health assessed. The primary endpoint was the number of fever episodes prospect ively documented by the parents. The analysis was performed by intention-to-treat and per- protocol, defined as > or = 50 % compliance. The infants in the probiotics group ( n = 55 ) were compared with the placebo group. After 26 wk of intervention, in infants that were exclusively formula fed, the concentration of sIgA was higher ( P = 0.001 ) and the incidence of bacterial overgrowth was lower ( P < 0.05 ). The median time to full enteral feeding was 13 d ( range : 7 - 31 d ). In the probiotic group, the proportion of infants who received a st and ard formula feeding was significantly higher than the control group ( 60.4 % ) to prevent sensitisation of infants to dietary allergens. BACKGROUND Prebiotics ( commonly oligosaccharides ) added to infant feeds have the potential to improve the nutritional status of infants with and.A+"
28220101," BACKGROUND Children exposed to early life adversity ( ELA ) have been shown to have elevated circulating concentrations of inflammatory markers that persist into adulthood. This pilot study tested an 8-week loving-kindness program for enhancing empathic accuracy, little is known about meditation practice s that foster compassion. Accordingly, the current study examined the effect of compassion meditation on innate immune, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to psychosocial stress and evaluated the degree to which engagement in meditation practice influenced stress reactivity.  Sixty-one healthy adults were r and omized to 6 weeks of training in compassion meditation ( n=33 ) or participation in a health discussion control group ( n =28 ) followed by exposure to a st and ardized laboratory stressor ( Trier social stress test [ TSST ] ). Physiologic and behavioral outcomes to the TSST were determined by repeated assessment s of plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 and cortisol as well as total distress scores on the Profile of Mood States ( POMS ). No main effect of group assignment on TSST responses was found for IL-6, cortisol or POMS scores. However, within the meditation group, increased meditation practice was correlated with decreased TSST-induced IL-4 ( r(p)=-0.46, p=0.008 ) and POMS distress scores. Within the CBCT group."

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : Patients : 274 patients from seven general practice s participated in a structured programme ( intervention group ) and 55 patients with diabetes mellitus, the control group. In the experimental group, 13 patients switched from a medical specialist's to a general practitioner's supervision , and a booklet on managing diabetes mellitus. In accordance with American Diabetes Association recommendations, urine dipstick and quantitative protein and microalbuminuria testing rates were calculated. RESULTS At baseline, 77 % of patients were screened for proteinuria with dipsticks or had quantitative urine testing. Of patients with negative dipstick findings, 30 % were identified as having albuminuria. The intervention group received a single review in the clinic.. The mean change in HbA1c was comparable between the intervention group and control group ( 5.8 vs. 5.2 % ). Both groups of practice s showed improved recording of review of inhaler technique, smoking habit, and review of asthma symptoms. In addition, prevalence of diabetes related crises ( hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia ). The study showed that the overall improvement in diabetes care was greatest in those patients at higher risk of hospitalization.. In all these parameters, except blood pressure, shared care out-performed the conventional care."
19588334," BACKGROUND We evaluated the effects of resistance training on strength and functional performance in older adults with coronary heart disease ( CHD ). The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a 6-month program of exercise on performance increments, plateaus, and decrements in older people. The study was performed in the rural town of Kahoku, Japan, the population of which is considered representative of the older population of Japan. PARTICIPANTS Twenty-nine healthy volunteers ( 18 men and 24 women ; mean age 79 years ( range 75 to 87 years ) ) were r and omly assigned to one of two groups, exercise or control.

27631314," Background The aim of this trial was to evaluate the impact of an enhanced recovery after surgery ( ERAS ) programme and the effect of various ERAS elements on outcomes following colorectal surgery. This non-randomized controlled study was done to assess the outcomes and impact of laparoscopic surgery and ERAS programme on patients undergoing elective open surgery. Methods A controlled r and omized trial with the ERAS programme was conducted from January 2011 to January 2014 in a university hospital. The primary outcome was the postoperative recovery.. Patients were grouped into < 80 years and ≥80 years, and perioperative data were collated. The postoperative outcomes were compared between the two groups. The factors that underpin outcomes from ERAS programmes for abdominal surgery. The incidence of postoperative complications, the length of hospital stay, and hospital stay. RESULTS Postoperative opioid consumption in the spinal group was significantly less than the group that underwent laparoscopically assisted surgery.  Mean adherence rate was 73 % in 2006 and 2007, 66 % in 2008 and 2009, 63 % in 2010 and 2011, and 82 % in 2012 and 2013. There was a shorter mean operative time ( 170 min vs. 192 min ; p = 0.002 ). The overall morbidity rate than group B ( 5.5 vs. 16.9 % ; p < 0.01 ).. The overall complication rates of SGA-A, SGA-B, and SGA-C patients were significantly higher than after open resection.. There were no significant differences in short-term outcomes of LOS, 30-day readmission rates, or costs for the episode of care.

28699541," Background A cluster-r and omised controlled trial of Aedes aegypti in households and the factors associated with dengue virus transmission. In 2013, Camino Verde trial in Nicaragua and Mexico included entomological information from the 2012 rainy and dry seasons. The study assessed the impact of the approach adopted by the intervention, one called Socialisation of Evidence for Participatory Action. The trial was conducted in 2010 - 2012, stratified by country, evidence of recent dengue virus infection in children aged 3 - 9, and vector indices. These discussion s were the first step in an effort at socialising evidence for dengue prevention. We used a matrix of odds ratios between outcomes, transformed to a symmetrical range ( −1, 1 ), and compared these between control and intervention clusters. The authors did not assign monetary value to days lost, since a lost day was to the trial itself, and they also acknowledged that large investments of household and government re sources to combat dengue have not had the expected results. We conducted entomological inspections in 11,995 households. Among 45,353 households examined, 6.5 % ( 2958/45,353 ) were positive for dengue infection, the majority of them were urban. We examined the effectiveness of intervention clusters ( IC ) than in control clusters ( CC ). We introduce here the result of that process, CONSORT 2010. An ethic of respect for individual and community autonomy, that does not come naturally to many vector control programs or to RCT research ers.

30333027," Background : To investigate the effects of a physical activity scale for measuring physical activity ( PA ) and sedentary behaviour in stroke survivors. We developed a stroke self-management program to address this gap and pilot test the program. Methods : We conducted a r and omized controlled trial at two Veterans Administration ( VA ) hospital sites where we recruited patients with an acute stroke to receive either the stroke program or an attention-control protocol. The activities were included in the physical activity checklist. The study included six sessions that facilitated stroke self management focusing on increasing self-efficacy to recover from stroke and engage in secondary stroke risk factor management. We surveyed outcomes at baseline, 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome was walking speed over 6 minutes, and secondary outcome measures were Human Activity Profile, Medical Outcome Study 36-Item Short-Form survey ( SF-36 ), Physiological Cost Index, and lower extremity muscle strength. Results : The 6-minute walking speed increased significantly in both groups and remained significantly improved by 1 year. The Mean ± SD of the Physical Activity Scale was significantly higher after intervention. The secondary outcomes include walking speed ( P < 0.0001 ) and was preserved at 1-yr follow-up. The clinical endpoint is the rate of stroke recurrence. The intervention was feasible with 96 % of sessions being delivered, each taking less than an hour ( 41 min, SD 12 ). There was no significant difference between groups in self-rated health. We will rehearse the collection of outcome data ( including walking and activities of daily living ) and reducing time spent sedentary. Fewer than 30 % of our study participants undertake recommended levels of PA. Increasing PA and /or sedentary behaviour is also high in this population.

21991471," The present study, performed in-vivo, included 30 infected primary teeth in 26 children in the age group of 3 - 8 years. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of two obturating material s, zinc oxide-eugenol and Maisto's paste, in infected primary molars. Investigators and editors developed the original CONSORT ( Consoli date d St and ards of Reporting Trials ) statement to help authors improve reporting by use of a checklist and flow diagram. The revised CONSORT statement presented here incorporates new evidence and addresses some criticisms of the initial statement. The checklist items pertain to the content of  the Title, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. The revision checklist includes 22 items selected because empirical evidence indicates that not reporting this information is associated with biased estimates of treatment effect, and the  Vitopex success rates were 78 % and 89 %. The difference in success rates between material s at 6 months was statistically significant, but at 12 months it was not. CONCLUSIONS Vitapex appeared to resolve furcation pathology at a foster rate than zinc oxide and eugenol. However, the pathology was present in 40 % and there was an overpush of these filling material within the canals."
27510030," Background Malaria is a major public health problem in Uganda and a and the current policy recommends introduction of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria ( RDTs ) to facilitate effective case management. The aim was to study the impact of a multi-faceted intervention on the dispensing practice s of children with malaria and other common childhood ( diarrhoea, acute respiratory tract infection-ARI ) illnesses in Kibaha district-Tanzania. Methods We conducted a r and omized controlled trial in 12 schools in Uganda. Data collection was undertaken eight months after the intervention. The intervention, based on formative research, consisted of community participation, peer education, public lectures, health clubs in the schools, and training of STD treatment providers. The outcomes were assessed by a pre-tested semi-structured question naire. The drug dispensers/sellers knowledge of anti-malarials and other drugs and their prescribing practice s was assessed. RESULTS The intervention seemed to have had a significant impact on knowledge pattern for prescribing and dispensing of antibiotics, and on drug prescribing, with the pharmacy as unit of analysis in both countries ( n = 107 pharmacies in Kenya ; n = 87 in Indonesia ). The primary outcome was the proportion of febrile patients receiving appropriate treatment with ACT. The regulatory activities have probably been an important factor behind the service quality improvements. It appeared feasible as well as effective to regulate private pharmacy practice in this particular low‐income setting.Conclusion Governments use different approaches to ensure that private for‐profit healthcare services meet certain quality st and ards. Such government guidance, referred to as public stewardship, encompasses government policies, regulatory mechanisms, and implementation strategies for ensuring accountability in to the delivery of services. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in low‐ and middle‐income countries ( LMICs ) have not been the subject of a systematic review..

19821388," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of a 2-year home based strength training program on the immune system in rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ). The method was a single blind r and omized controlled trial. The measured variables included morning stiffness, a pain score, number of swollen joints, a health assessment score, a functional score, ESR, and their relation to RA. The control group ( n = 23 ) were assessed for the response to these two quite different rehabilitative measures that included : functional classification, joint score index, subjective VAS of pain, HAQ, pain disability index, and CRP. All subjects were recruited from an outpatient rheumatology clinic or physical therapy department and met the study inclusion criteria. RESULTS The primary outcome measure was the Stanford Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales II ( AIMS II ) ( upper limb ; h and and finger function subscales ). Both groups showed improvement in different assessment parameters ; patients with higher education and, therefore, with a less joint-disturbing work profile appeared to profit more from an extensive in-patient rehabilitation program. At follow-up, both groups showed a deterioration of aerobic capacity, but in favor of the exercise classes, the patients were able to behold their muscle strength gains. Functional ability, gained during the previous participation in high-intensity exercises, remained stable in both groups. The study findings suggest that short-term ( < three months ) and long-term training, while no impact on aerobic capacity. The differences in AIMS change scores between group 1 and groups 2 and 3 were statistically significant ( P = 0.015 ). At the post-test, all the strength values in both patient groups were excellent."
19076553," BACKGROUND : The aim of this study was to determine the effect of oral vitamin E on blood glucose and insulin variables, blood lipids, and blood markers of oxidative stress in type 2 diabetes. We studied the hypothesis that the elevated intake of vitamin C, a major dietary form of vitamin E, may have protective properties different from those of alpha-tocopherol. In the present study, the effects of a 4-week oral treatment with alpha-lipoic acid were evaluated in a placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Patients with Type 2 diabetes ( 32 men, 96 women, aged 30–69 years ), treated by placebo or diet plus oral antidiabetic drugs. The treated and placebo groups were given vitamin E tablets ( 200 mg/day ) and placebo respectively. The following parameters were measured before and after treatment : 1 ) endothelial function ( forearm arterial blood flow during local intra-arterial administration of 1.5, 4.0, and 15 microg/min ), and insulin levels were also determined. The results showed no significant change in plasma glucose ( fasting and 2 hour post glucose load ), plasma insulin, and the means of HDL-cholesterol, and serum and urinary chromium were all increased. The mean drug dosage decreased slightly ( and significantly in case of Glibenclamide ). The role of nutritional supplementation is of increasing interest with regard to ocular disease.. Serum and cellular glutathione levels in patients with diabetes was significantly lower than in the placebo group ( 62 ± 2.9 % vs. 1.7 ± 0.6 μg/mg of total proteins,. The effect of the supplementation was also significantly lower in those with diabetes, with a greater tendency to renal insufficiency..

24621460," This study was conducted to determine the effect of acute aerobic exercise on executive function in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ). Forty children with ADHD were r and omly assigned into exercise or control groups. Participants in the exercise group performed a moderate intensity aerobic exercise for 30 min, whereas the control group watched a running/exercise-related video.  Neuropsychological tasks, the Stroop Test and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test ( WCST ). The authors administered cognitive, motor, social, and behavioral functioning measures at pre- and postprogram, assessed response inhibition weekly, and coded negative behaviors daily. Results : Several measures showed significant or marginally significant change over time ( effect size = 0.35 - 0.96 ) with additional measures showing meaningful effect size values ( ≥ 0.20 ). Response inhibition effects were most consistent. Most participants ( 64 % to 71 % ) exhibited overall improvement according to postprogram parent, teacher, and program staff ratings. Conclusion : Physical activity shows promise for addressing ADHD symptoms in young children. Brain dialysates were analysed with microbore liquid chromatography ( LC ), with electrochemical detection ( monoamines and GABA ) and fluorescence detection ( GLU ). Soleus citrate synthase and basal striatal concentrations of DA, NA and GLU were significantly different between the trained and control animals. Sixty minutes of exercise significantly increased extracellular DA, P < 0.001 ), Corsi's block-tapping task backward ( P =0.03 ), Rey-Osterrieth complex figure immediate recall, and fluoxetine. Additionally, our results suggest that  children ’s attention deficits can be minimized through PA irrespective of treatment with MTP..

32248332," Background Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is a common arrhythmia with relevant impact on mortality and morbidity.  Pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) is an established therapy in patients who remain symptomatic after catheter ablation.  Surgical ablation of AF, using either st and ard, minimally invasive, or hybrid techniques, is available in most major hospitals throughout the world. This prospect i ve study included 312 adults ( mean age 71 ± 6 years, 56 % men ) with AF ( 76 paroxysmal, 27 persistent ) and 30 matched controls underwent transthoracic echocardiography and 2D-ST-LA-deformation analysis with assessment of LA-radial and LA-longitudinal strain ( Sr, Sl ), and velocities derived from the apical 4- and 2-chamber views ( 4CV, 2CV ). AF recurrence was assessed during 6 months of follow-up. For determination of AF-related LA changes, AF patients were compared to controls and patients with AF recurrences after ablation procedures ( n = 30, 29.1 % ) were compared with patients who maintained sinus rhythm ( n= 73, 70.9 % ). Conclusion : All LA parameters, traditional parameters, and parameters derived by speckle tracking echocardiogramography were independently predictive of combined outcomes ( p < 0.0001 for all comparisons ). In these patients, global PALS ( area under receiver operator characteristic curve ): 0.79, 95 % confidence interval : 0.67 - 0.96 ; P = 0.004...

16720668," BACKGROUND A large proportion of men over 65 years of age have low serum testosterone ( T ) levels, which may contribute to their bone loss in men. The study was a matched case-control study performed at an in-hospital orthopedic service at a semi-rural and academic tertiary care center. The patients were seventeen men who presented with hip fractures after simple falls over a 10-month period, 11 men with a history of hip fractures in the preceding 25 months, and 28 r and omly assigned to receive testosterone... We assessed the physiological and biochemical effects of T therapy in 13 men with AIDS wasting ( two 2.5-mg patches per day ) or placebo patches for 1 year. All men received 500 mg supplemental calcium and 400 IU vitamin D. The main outcome measures were the percent changes in lumbar-spine, hip, and total-body bone mineral density.. The men who received alendronate had a mean ( + /-SE ) increase in bone mass ( 1.5 %, + 5.8 %, and -0.9 % in testosterone, n and rolone, and placebo groups, respectively. The mean serum osteocalcin, a bone formation marker, decreased in those who received placebo. Total body scans were measured at baseline and during treatment.. Baseline bone turnover and BMD were compared with those in 35 age-matched healthy non-HIV-infected control subjects.  Three subjects receiving placebo and seven subjects receiving  testosterone  withdrew from the study. There was no suggestion of a positive effect of testosterone on bone density in men with osteoporosis.. Although testosterone supplementation improved strength, increased hemoglobin, and lowered leptin levels in older men compared with placebo. The extent to which testosterone can prevent and treat osteoporotic in men remains unclear. andA.-).+/}) "
29900130," BACKGROUND Vitamin D is an immunomodulator and can alter response to tuberculosis ( TB ). Recent studies have shown that vitamin D insufficiency is associated with a higher risk of active tculosis.  Laboratory studies provided a mechanism for this link on the basis of findings to vitamin D supplementation and TB treatment, T-cell counts and nutritional outcomes. METHODS A double-blind r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) to establish causal connection between the intervention and any particular endpoint. This paper focuses on problems that arise in the use of vitamin D or placebo and followed up at 6 weeks. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The primary outcome measure was assessed with a functional whole blood assay ( BCG-lux assay ), which measures the ability of whole blood to restrict luminescence, and thus growth, of recombinant reporter mycobacteria.  Sputum was checked at interval of 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Adults with new smear-positive PTB were eligible. The trial was registered at Clinical Trials.gov NCT00677339. Results Mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations at enrolment were 69.8 ( ±21.5 ) nmol/L ( 27.9 ( ±8.6 ) ng/mL ). Vitamin D insufficiency ( < 75 μg/L ) was associated with the highest risk of relapse ( p=0.067 ). Glycated hemoglobin levels reduced from 11.1±1.3 to 7.7±0.9 in group 1 versus 10.3 ±1.1 ( p>0.1 ). Conclusion Vitamin D might be promising to serve as an adjunctive therapy for pulmonary TB."
24465519," BACKGROUND A revised version of the Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders ( SCARED-R ) is a recently developed self-report question naire for measuring the same construct. To facilitate instrument selection, our aim was to develop a highly sensitive search filter for finding studies on measurement properties of anxiety disorders in children with ASD. The CBT program emphasized in vivo exposure supported by parent training and school consultation to promote social communication and emotion regulation skills. The MASC four-factor structure was confirmed and its subscales were compared against Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL ) scores, DSM-IV axis I classifications, and global assessment of functioning ( GAF ). RESULTS In this sample of clinical ly referred youths, the two MASC items as well as age differentiated between anxious and depressed pediatric patients. The two intervention groups demonstrated significant decreases in parent-reported anxiety symptoms at follow-up and a significant increase in the child's ability to generate positive strategies in an anxiety-provoking situation. CONCLUSIONS The study showed that children and families were willing to be recruited and r and omised. The variety of outcome measurement tools being used, and lack of knowledge about the measurement properties  of some, compromise conclusions regarding the most effective interventions. OBJECTIVES This two-stage systematic review aim ed to identify the best tools used in studies evaluating interventions for anxiety for high-functioning children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ). However, to date, there is no evidence for the appropriateness and measurement properties."
31076471," BACKGROUND Community consultation is an on-going, arduous, and necessary process for developing effective health promotion programs. The challenges are amplified when the particular health issue or research question is not prominent in the consciousness of the targeted community. In this paper, we explore the community-based participatory research ( CBPR ) model as a means to negotiate a mutual agenda between communities and research ers. The paper is focused on the ( perceived ) need for cervical cancer screening in an under-re source d community in Cape Town, South Africa. The mapping also informed intervention-related decisions such as where to situate the services. The participatory methods used a prepared set of questions to guide the discussion s and to solicit feedback from the communities that could not have been derived from existing data or data collected through st and ard data collection techniques. Furthermore, the methods lay the foundation for collaborative community research partnerships. Each group will comprise 6 to 8 participants. We will also conduct 22 semi-structured key informant interviews ( informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework ) with several types of providers and hospital administrators. Purposive and maximum variation sampling will be used to identify and recruit participants from participating hospitals.

28191040," Background Xerosis is a common skin disorder frequently observed in diabetic patients. The presence of xerosis increases the risk of complications, including infection and hyperkeratosis. This trial investigated the effect of a 1.5 % chitin-glucan formulation with its placebo, and commercially available glycerol formulations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a test moisturizer containing 10 % urea and 4 % lactic acid versus its emulsion base vehicle in the treatment of  xerosis of the feet in patients with diabetes.. Forty patients ( mean age 62 + /- 11 years ) with diabetes and moderate-to-severe xerotic of both feet were enrolled. With both lotions, significant improvement began during the second week of treatment and continued into the fourth week. The tested moisturizer was applied to one foot and the vehicle to the other, twice a day, for 4 weeks. The results revealed that both moisturiser formulations significantly improved the xerosis, the skin barrier function ( transepidermal water loss, TEWL ), erythema, thickness ( ultrasound ) and hydration ( conductance ). Results showed that the regular use of both moisturizers had a significant hydrating effect on the foot. A steep increase was followed by a plateau level and a rapid decline after stopping treatment. Conclusion : The increased moisturizer formulations best alleviate xerotic symptoms, there are no evidence -based recommendations on which moisturiser formulation for primary and diabetes related foot xerosis.. The study was designed to guide clinical practice in treating the symptoms of primary foot Xerosis, by identifying from the existing literature the most effective ingredient or formulation of topical treatments for primary foot xerotic conditions."

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the efficacy of calcium alone and calcium plus vitamin D supplementation to prevent cancer.. RESULTS We used high-performance liquid chromatography to measure vitamin D in sample s of 13 br and s of milk with various fat contents and 5 brand s of infant formula purchased at r or om from local supermarkets in five Eastern states. The subjects were 1179 community-dwelling women.. Serum levels of 25-hydroxy [ 25-(OH ) ] vitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxy [ 1,125-(OH)2 ] vitamin C levels were determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry.. Vitamin D models were also adjusted for the location of the clinic site.. Risk ratios ( RRs ) for any adenoma recurrence were computed for calcium supplementation within groups defined by serum vitamin D levels ( p = 0.04 ).. No vitamin D was detected in the 5th compared with the lowest quintile than in controls ( P < 0.03 ). The supplemented group had higher aBMD at the level of radial metaphysis ( mean + /- SEM, 0.301 +/- 0.003 vs. 0.283+/-0.008 ), whereas among those with levels above the median, calcium supplementation was associated with a reduced risk ( RR = 0,71, 95 % CI = 0 to 0.89, P for interaction =.012 ). Total vitamin D intake was weakly inversely associated with risk of rickets (.. ).

29620793," BACKGROUND The efficacy of tricyclics and benzodiazepines in the treatment of panic disorder. The authors examined the efficacy and safety of the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor sertraline, versus placebo. The study's primary aim was to discern the influence of varying degrees of depression on the comparative efficacy of alprazolam, imipramine and placebo.. Patients who developed panic disorder, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale, and the Clinical Anxiety Scale, were treated. After 2 weeks of single-blind placebo, patients were r and omly assigned to treatment with either imipramine. The treatment response was similar to placebo, but cognitive therapy was not superior to fluvoxamine. The primary outcome was panic attack frequency at week 10 compared to baseline. At the end of treatment, there was not a significant difference between patients treated with placebo, and patients in this group. The majority of patients ( 57 % ) were rated moderately improved or better vs 40 % ( 8/20 ) of those who did not in terms of panic attacks. The results indicate that : ( 1 ) the administration of antidepressants, as compared with placebo -, led to a significant reduction in total panic attacks, that has a rapid onset, reaches a peak within 10 minutes, and in which at least four of 13 characteristic symptoms are experienced, including racing heart, chest pain, sweating, dizziness, stomach churning, and breathlessness. CONCLUSIONS Panic disorder is characterised by repeated, unexpected panic attacks, which represent a discrete period of fear or anxiety that is typically mild to moderate..

23314270," Objective. This study evaluated whether a combined behavioral and dietary intervention would affect young women's  calcium intake and bone mineral content ( BMC ). The study also examined whether observed effects varied as a function of one particular health endpoint, the age of women. The intervention group was given nutrition education during 18 months to improve calcium intake, while the control group had the usual diet.. Of this number, 98 women were r and omly assigned to the intervention group that viewed the video before their office visit. The treatment group received a tailored intervention. The outcome measures were assessed using a quasi-experimental study with a nested design and pre-, immediate post-, and 3-month follow-up assessment s.  Calcium and vitamin D intake, Theory of Planned Behavior constructs, and knowledge were measured at three time points. RESULTS The IG was found to have a higher decrease in the percentage of energy intake derived from total fat and a higher increase in  the intake of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and potassium. Results. A written mailed copy of the study protocol followed the telephone interview... The experimental group had increased significantly ( P < 0.01 ) while it had no significant changes in controls. The control group received six weekly nonrelated financial lessons by mail. Changes for each measure were assessed by linear mixed model with repeated measures adjusted for confounding variables.Conclusion : The intervention led to a greater increase in femoral neck BMD than those with normal BMD ( 1.6 % p.a. vs. 0.7 % p/a., p = 0.001 ). In the current study, women were losing BMC, and the women who made the largest increases in calcium intake were able to retard this bone loss.

We compared clinical measures, prescribed medication, cardiovascular morbidity and self-rated health in individuals without diabetes in a screened vs. an unscreened population. Methods A controlled trial in eight European countries, including a treatment group of 3064 people and a control group of 29,122 people. In 1994, non- participants who declined the offered treatment for diabetes, the intervention group achieved their individual blood pressure target during a 28 day run-in period of monotherapy. The primary endpoints-measured at 1 year-were mortality, total as well as cause-specific, and at least one treatable risk factor. The control group comprised six men and 12 women. The other included health screening, written feedback and a planned 45-min follow-up visit with the general practitioner. The study concluded that general health checks were employed to reduce mortality. The number of patients with diabetes from both population s were included. The difference was not a result of medication use. Similar results were found in the control group. Similar differences between participants and non-participants were also seen in terms of mortality.

28265017," BACKGROUND Obesity is associated with the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Obesity is a novel oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, but the relation between obesity and established nonvalvular AF for stroke and all-cause death is still unclear. METHODS The Fushimi AF Registry is a community-based prospect i ve survey of AF patients who visited the participating medical institutions in Fushmi-ku, Japan. The BW and follow-up data were available for 2,945 patients. The primary efficacy end point was stroke or systemic embolism. The secondary outcome was death from any cause, the primary outcome was the use of the four cardioprotective medication classes ( statins, ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, β-blockers, and antiplatelet agents ). The main outcomes were 1.50 % with warfarin ( median time in the therapeutic range, 68.4 % ), as compared with 1.18 % with high-dose edoxaban ( hazard ratio, 0.79 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.57 - 3.04 ; P<0.01 ). In secondary prevention,  The risk of a composite end point of "" ischemic stroke, thromboembolism, or death "" was significantly higher in overweight ( crude hazard ratio [ HR ] 1.31, 95 % CI : 0.64 to 1.68 ; P=0.001 for superiority ).. The rate of major bleeding was 2.13 % per year for the group receiving 110 mg of dabigatran ( 1.61 and 0.47, respectively ). Good anticoagulation control also attenuated the association between BMI categories and outcomes. In patients with AF, overweight and obesity were not significantly associated with a higher incidence of stroke/SE. In contrast, obesity is a risk factor for both primary and secondary CV prevention, although the inverse relationship between overweight or obesity and a better cardiovascular prognosis in both age- and sex-matched patients..). and "
24788950," BACKGROUND : To investigate the effect of physical activity on the bone content ( BMC ) and physical activity in adolescents and to examine the influence of body fatness on physical performance. METHODS This cross sectional study reports the association between childhood obesity, measures of physical fitness, and health status. A total of 114 boys ( 9.4±1.5 y, Tanner I ) and 188 girls ( mean age=15.7 years ) were included. The inflammatory markers evaluated included C-reactive protein ( CRP ), leptin, adiponectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6. Demographic and anthropometric data were collected. A modified LBP question naire was used to assess the presence of LBP. The Physical Fitness Index ( PF ), anthropometric variables ( body circumferences and skinfolds ) and biochemical variables. The PA was assessed using the same parameters. A positive attitude to aerobic exercise  and high performance in the nine-minute run test among the boys and the girls decreased the risk of smoking. We observed a grade d association of CRP and leptin levels across groups ( P < 0.05 ), and muscle fitness ( P ≤ 0.001 for all participants ). The probability of 13-year-olds having relatively high values of cardiovascular disease indicators was significantly lower than controls ( p =.002 and.005, respectively ). P =.001. The waist and hip circumferences correlated positively with each other, muscular fitness ( MF ) and total body mass ( p<0.001 ), whereas no association was observed between muscular fitness and health outcomes. While research has traditionally focused on two-dimensional health status, the relationship between cardio-respiratory fitness and overall health status has recently received increased attention. The aim of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to evaluate the potential physiological and psychological benefits associated with MF among children and adolescents."

24933494," Background : The effect of a community pharmacist-based home blood pressure ( BP ) monitoring program on the quality of care in patients with hypertension. The objective of this study was to evaluate if a telephonic nurse disease management ( DM ) program design ed for African Americans is more effective than a home monitoring program. The study was a prospective, randomized controlled trial in three healthcare centres ( 18 GPs ) in deprived neighbourhoods of two major Dutch cities. A total of 845 newly admitted patients with uncontrolled hypertension ( JNC7 stages 1 or 2 ). Intervention subjects received a BP monitor and access to an information technology – supported adherence and BP monitoring system to patients, while the control group received usual care. The mean adjusted difference in systolic BP ( SBP ) from baseline in the intervention group was 17.32 mm Hg, whereas the mean control group SBP level increased 2.73 mm Hg ( P = 0.003 ). The primary outcome was based on simultaneous modeling of glycated hemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol, and systolic blood-pressure levels and Symptom Checklist-20 ( SCL-20 ). Results We achieved equal distributions of the sociodemographic, biophysical and lifestyle characteristics between the two groups. The intervention group had a mean age of 56 years, 63 % were Latinos/Hispanics, 65 % female, 61 % less educated, and 62 % were not employed. The difference in SBP/DBP ratio was significant ( P <.05 ) to be female, and to improve medication compliance and knowledge without adversely affecting health-related quality of life.

The study was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficiency of oral morphine compared with intramuscular pethidine for postoperative pain. The number of patients undergoing the operation was similar in the two groups. The postoperative pain was assessed by the visual analogue scale ( VAS ). In the control group, the postoperative pain score was similar. A group of patients were randomized to receive either a lumbar intrathecal injection of morphine ( 75 or 100 μg ) or a subhepatic closed drain was left for 24 hours. Group C : normal saline 25 to 30 ml/kg body weight at a temperature of 37 ° C was infused to assess pain intensity. The procedure was completed in all patients after the first postoperative day. The average score for pain scores and opioid toxicity was significantly lower than the controls. Postoperative pain was not significantly different between the groups.. The mean postoperative pain scores were similar in both groups. Postoperative nausea and vomiting, and postoperative pain were significantly lower in those who received the abdominal wall lift. This technique could be a feasible alternative procedure in patients seeking better cosmetic results.

31867068," BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of three different types of exercise training on gait, balance, and the rate of falls  in older adults with functional limitations. The study was a single-blinded, controlled trial with a factorial design. Twenty-four elderly ( 91.9 ± 4.1 years old ) were r and omized into intervention or control group. The intervention group performed a twice-weekly, 12-week multicomponent exercise program composed of muscle power training ( the Sunbeam Program ) or placebo tablets and two unsupervised home sessions. We assessed back pain and its related disability and health-related quality of life.. The participants were moderate to severe cognitive problems, inability to ambulate independently, neurological conditions that severely influenced gait and mobility. The outcome was mainly the result of participants with low initial strength. Walking speed was assessed using the FICSIT-4 tests. The outcomes were total scores on a modified Physical Performance Test ( PPT ), the Functional Status Question naire physical function subscale ( FSQ ), and changes in the domains of pain and disability. RESULTS The study showed that the intervention group had a significant improvement in those scores, whereas the scores of the control group worsened. Results for the other evaluations were similarly favourable in both exercise groups ( P = 0.05 ). In both training groups significantly ( RT ) increased the strength, and functional capacity ( e.g. gait speed, chair-rise ). Additionally, there were significant improvements in self-reported disability ( p < 0.01 ). The effects of RT interventions have a strong negative impact on older adults ( ≥65 years ) with functional limitation. The results of our study suggest that RT interventions can improve the outcomes of gait, functional capacity, and related to the need for assistance and health care services.

25917824," OBJECTIVE To determine overall, test-retest and inter-rater reliability of posture indices among persons with idiopathic scoliosis. DESIGN A reliability study using two raters and two test sessions. SETTING Tertiary care paediatric centre. For coronal curves, a method originally described by Cobb and for sagittal curves a modified Cobb method are most widely used in practice, and these methods have been shown to exhibit good-to-excellent reliability and reproducibility. Of these, the Scoligauge mimics a scoliometer. Methods The study enrolled 13 - 15-year-old pupils attending a junior secondary school ( mean age 14.2 years ). The study group consisted of 138 participants, including 71 girls and 67 boys, who underwent a clinical evaluation of the body posture and an examination with the Zebris CMS 10 system.  Results Statistically significant discrepancies between the clinical and objective evaluation were noted to lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis.. The estimated probability of survival was approximately 0.55 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 0.47 - 0.63 ). There was no significant difference in the demographic characteristics of both groups were noted for the pelvic rotation and trunk position on the frontal plane. The Idiopathic Scoliosis patients had a significantly larger root mean square amplitude of anterior-posterior displacement than the T1 and S1 spinous processes in reference to the base of support... Limits of agreement and SEM values were larger for shoulder protraction.. the thoracic and lumbar Cobb angles were significantly correlated with thoracic or lumbar apical vertebra ( P = 0.0001 and 0.0015, respectively ). Conclusion As accurate and reproducible measurements of spinal curvature are crucial in diagnosing scoliosis, this study demonstrates that postural abnormalities are evident during quiet st and ing in adolescent idiopathy and.-).A."
28328940," Background To evaluate the impact of Oportunidades, a large-scale, conditional cash transfer programme in Mexico, on the quality of maternal health care received by poor women. In addition, we examine the cost of obstetric care  and the social and economic consequences associated with exposure to economic shocks up to a year following the end of pregnancy. A pre-test/post-test non-experimental study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Household interviews were conducted with r and omly selected women who delivered in 1998 or 1999 across seven Mexican states.. The VS, implemented in 2010, provided vouchers for delivery services at public and private health facilities ( HF ), as well as round-trip transportation provided by private sector workers ( bicycles or motorcycles generally ). The study was part of a quasi-experimental non-r and omized control trial. Compared with women who had uncomplicated deliveries, women who survived near-miss events experienced substantial difficulties meeting the costs of care, reflecting the high cost of emergency obstetric care, the low socioeconomic status of their households. This finding was confirmed by the different intervention and control groups. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated by logistic regression to adjust for varying maternal characteristics. Results The women targeted by voucher outreach workers were poorer, less educated, and at higher parity. The financial intervention did not influence the number of visits, but was associated with increased caesarean sections and a decrease in many ultrasound tests. The clinical intervention influenced some indicators of care content. There was no consistent finding for the health education intervention. Financial and training interventions have the potential to improve maternal health outcomes. The necessity of meeting unexpectedly high costs challenged social expectations and patterns of reciprocity between husb and s, wives and wider social networks."
16477438," The effect of metformin therapy on glucose metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) was determined in a double-blind cross-over study. Patients were treated for 12 weeks with either metformin ( 850 mg x 3 ) or placebo using a stepwise dosing protocol. To avoid the confounding effect of improved glycemic control on insulin action and secretion, patients were first rendered euglycemic with 4 weeks of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII ), followed by 2 weeks of metformin ( 200 mg thrice daily ), or placebo. After treatment, 3-h euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps ( 40 mU. m(-2 ). min(-1 ) ) were performed, and muscle biopsies were obtained immediately before and after the clamps. Compared with  placebo, hepatic glucose uptake ( HGP ) decreased by approximately twofold in P+ in association with increased adipose tissue gene expression.

Participants 561 current smokers aged over 35. Men were r and omly assigned either to a special intervention ( SI ) program consisting of stepped-care treatment for hypertension, counseling for cigarette smoking, and dietary advice for lowering blood cholesterol levels, or to their usual sources of health care in the community ( UC ). Over an average follow-up period of seven years, risk factor levels declined in both groups.. Both groups were advised to quit and offered referral to local NHS smoking cessation services. Main outcome measures The primary outcome measure was verified cessation of smoking by salivary cotinine testing 12 months after recruitment. Secondary outcomes were reported changes in daily consumption of cigarettes and identification of new diagnoses of chronic obstructive lung disease. Results Follow-up was 89 %. Independently verified quit rates for the intervention group, respectively, were 13.6 % and 6.4 % ( difference 7.2 % ), while time engaged in exercise increased by 39 % ( 43 % ). Differences were not significant. After adjustment for other factors, approximately 28 % of CHD events in men and 29 % in women were attributable to blood pressure levels that exceeded high normal ( > or = 130/85 ). The corresponding multivariable-adjusted attributable risk percent associated with elevated total cholesterol ( 5.11 ) for Bangladeshi women, 4.53 ( 3.67 to 5.59 ) for Indian men, 2.15 ( 1.84 to 2.52 ) for Pakistani women.

23461747," BACKGROUND Despite the broad use of  crown-lengthening surgery ( CLS ) , there is no complete agreement as to the desired amount of exposed sound tooth structure needed to accommo date both the restorative needs and the reformation of the supraosseous gingiva ( SOG ). Classically, the following indices were determined before as well as 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after preparation. Variables were the alloy used, oral hygiene index score before treatment, location of crown margins at baseline, and plaque index and sulcus bleeding index scores recorded for restored and control teeth after 1 year. The effect of crown margin placement on sulcular bleeding and plaque accumulation was analyzed with regression models ( P<.05 ). RESULTS The probability of plaque at 1 year increased with increasing oral health index score and treatment. The lingual surfaces demonstrated the highest probability of bleeding. The mean of bleeding at intrasulcular posterior crown margins was approximately twice that at supragingival margins. Primary treatment was not significantly different during the investigation, but PBI increased in all groups. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the means for the mean buccal, mean lingual, and overall mean SOG dimensions at baseline to corresponding measurements at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS Intraclass correlation coefficients for TSP measures of SOG to DBL measures of POG ranged from 83.4 % agreement to 91.9 % agreement, with all correlations being highly significant ( P < 0.001 ), indicating a high degree of agreement between TSP and DBL. The differences in SOG Dimensions, 6 months after surgery compared to baseline, were as follows : mean bu Buccal, 0.51 mm ; mean luminal/palatal, 0 to 0.56 mm. These differences were significant for all three comparisons."

We therefore sought to determine whether measures of health and functioning in older people with diabetes affect the incidence of falls.. The study included the population of elderly women aged 65 years and over the study. The study was conducted in the Netherlands. A total of 1365 community-dwelling persons aged 65 to 99 years were included. In this study ( n = 1437 ), an interaction between "" immediate memory "" and age was found. In persons aged 75 years and older, the number of falls ( recurrent fallers ) was identified as those who fell at least two times within 6 months. Using regression modeling, we estimated the risk of incident falls associated with baseline WML volume. RESULTS Fifty-six percent of the men reported at least 1 fall. The incidence of recurrent falls was higher among women ( P=0.01 ) and 8.2 ( 95 % CI, 4.5 - 12.0 ). The use of thiazide diuretics has been associated with a reduced risk for falls, with risk ratios ranging from 0.3 to 0.8. The effect of low testosterone levels was most apparent in younger men ( 65 - 69 years ), followed by older men ( 1.7 % of men and 10.9 % of women ). Poor physical performance ( Multivariate analysis showed that those with falls were more likely to have a higher risk of falls, which appeared to be the main cause of falls among elderly women with non-insulin-treated diabetes ( OR 2.1 ; 95 %CI 1.1 - 2.9 )..

25411286," BACKGROUND This study aims to compare the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) and all cause mortality  in preterm infants. Because probiotics may reduce the incidence of bacterial colonization and the risk of preterm infants with very low birth weight, we have administered a probiotic mixture to all admitted infants of < 32 weeks'gestation. Methods We tested the hypothesis that high nutrient intake or formula feeding in infancy programs greater leptin concentrations relative to fat mass in later life. RESULTS A double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted in 231 preterm infants ( gestational age, ≥32 + 0 and ≤36 + 6 weeks ). The infants were divided into two groups : Group A and B received a dose of 1.6 x 10(8 ) cells of probiotic supplementation ( B. breve and L. casei )  and a control group of 112 infants who received placebo. The primary outcome was the occurrence of NEC. There was no difference in weight gain between the groups. The incidence of NEC stage ≥ 2 ( 4 % vs 5 % ; p = 0.63 ). Stool fungal colonization, an important outcome parameter was 3.03 ± 2.33 × 105 colony formation units ( CFU ). There were no differences in mortality.. The probiotic group had significantly lower than the placebo group ( 0.62 % vs 12.5 % ; P <.05 ). Conclusion Prophylactic S. boulardii supplementation is as effective  as nystatin  in reducing gut maturity and function in preterm neonates.

The primary objective is to evaluate the five-year survivorship of a cemented primary total knee prosthesis between 1988 and 2004. Since the last evaluation of this cohort, the mean WOMAC scores ( 11 points versus 13 points ) and UCLA activity scores ( 6.9 points versus 7.1 points ) were similar in both groups. At review, all stems were considered stable according to the clinical outcome. No migration or subsidence was observed on plain radiographs. Interpretation Our results are comparable to published results of primary THA in patients younger than 55 years. Considering the long-range fixation of two-stage bilateral hip arthroplasty ( THA ) the 3 cases were performed for septic loosening and 9 cups were revised for aseptic loosening. This technique appears to be a reasonable alternative in younger patients with femoral deformities. At the time of each followup, the authors were assessed clinical outcomes.

26838086," OBJECTIVE : To examine the efficacy and safety of three doses of estradiol gel 0.1 % ( Bayer ), the perceived severity of the menopause transition, and the association between the two. The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation is a prospect i ve cohort study following a group of 3,302 women from five racial/ethnic groups at seven clinical sites nationwide. Using longitudinal data encompassing 6 years of follow-up, we examined trends in use of five categories of CAM ( nutritional, physical, psychological, herbal, and folk ) by menopause status and ethnicity. To account for potential secular changes in the study population, we also evaluated the impact of treatment on the clinical parameters.. Clinical parameters, serum concentrations of estrogen, type of therapy, and symptomatic relief were compared between baseline and 60 months post-treatment. Clinical trials.gov : NCT02033512. Patients rated their vasomotor, mood, and quality -of-life symptoms as absent, mild, moderate, or severe at baseline. Patients reported significant improvements in attitudes and reductions in symptom severity compared to their own baseline scores and compared with the control group. In general, there were significant reductions in frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms from baseline compared with placebo as early as Week 2 that were maintained throughout treatment. The objective of this study was to determine whether postmenopausal women ( Menopause through transdermal treatment is a critical phenomenon in women's life.

We determined whether sex and diabetes were factors associated with the response to exercise rehabilitation in patients with claudication. METHODS Twenty-one patients were assigned r and omized to 12 weeks of supervised exercise programs or to a home-based exercise group. After 12 weeks the participants in the supervised group transitioned to another supervised exercise program. On a separate day, venous blood draws were performed at rest and 10 min following a symptom-limited grade d treadmill test ( SL-GXT ). Plasma sample s were snap-frozen for analysis of nitrite by reductive chemiluminescence.  The incidence of deaths  was high ( 84 % ), and there was no significant difference ( P >.05 ) in  the amount of exercise completed among the four groups. In Cox proportional hazards models, the risk of mobility impairment was significantly increased by older age ( 6%/year ), peripheral neuropathy ( 40 % increase ), stroke history ( 123 % ). The Quality Index had high internal consistency ( KR-20 : 0.89 ) as did the subscales apart from external validity ( 6.4 vs. 30.8 %, P = 0.48 ).. The relative gain in MWD was 88 % greater in those with diabetes. The vascular parameters were comparable for both groups before and after WT. The supervised group experienced a greater improvement ( P < 0.01 ) than the home group but not at 24 weeks. The on-site group also experienced significant improvements in ICD after exercise therapy ( SET ), based on the presence of comorbidities and the possibly increased risks. The specific causes of each functional problem are largely distinct, and different approaches may be required to prevent the development of.)..

Fifty teeth diagnosed with apical periodontitis ( n = 96 ) were r and omly assigned to either group.  Root canal sampling and culturing  were performed before and immediately after instrumentation, and after treatment during the second visit. In the first visit the sample s were incubated anaerobically for 7 days at 37 degrees C, colony-forming unit numbers calculated, and a log transformation performed to normalize the counts... The results indicated that clindamycin offered no advantage over conventional root canal dressings, such as calcium hydroroxide, and it is therefore not recommended for use in routine endodontic therapy. The McNemar test showed a significant reduction ( p<0.0009 ) in bacteria between S1 and S2. This was also true between S2 and SC ( p <0.0019 ). It was concluded that the GT protocol significantly reduced the number of bacteria in  the canal but failed to render the canals free in more than half the cases.."
19789953," BACKGROUND Postnatal and antenatal depression are a focus of considerable clinical and research attention, but little is known about the patterns of anxiety across this period. METHODS  Self-reported anxiety and depression were assessed at 18 and 32 weeks gestation and 8 weeks and 8 months postnatally in a prospect i ve longitudinal study of a community sample of women in Engl and ( n=8323 ). Parental reports of child and parent functioning were gathered. Associations between parental and child functioning assessed at 6 to 8 months postpartum, and RAP measured at age 6(3/4 ) years were investigated. CONCLUSION The prevalence of RAP in this sample was 11.8 %. The relation of infant attachment and temperament measures to subsequent psychopathology is discussed. The mean EPDS of the mothers whose infants had infantile colic ( 10.2 ± 6.0 ) and paternal anxiety ( adjusted odds ratio = 1.38 ; 95 % confidence interval 1.12 - 1.71 ). The inclusion of diagnostic assessment for panic disorder and acute adjustment disorder with anxiety increased the rates of caseness by between 57 and 100 % for mothers, and 31 - 130 % for fathers.. The effect at 81 months was comparable to what was previously obtained at 47 months, suggesting the kind of persistent effect proposed in the animal literature. CONCLUSIONS There is evidence that  antenatal stress/anxiety  has a programming effect on children and makes recommendations for future research."

27479272," Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different doses of oral estradiol ( E2 ) treatment regimens for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women. Design : This was a r and omized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. The study was conducted. Postmenopausal women ( N=454 ) with at least eight moderate-to-severe hot flushes per day applied daily, one, two, or three E2 ( 1.5 mg ) or placebo. Results : The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage change in mean daily number of hot flushes over 7 days from baseline to final examination. At the 12th week the decrease from a baseline average of eight to nine episodes per day was 78 % with 7D-25, 93 % and 97 % respectively with placebo. Safety variables included changes in the rate of amenorrhea, endometrial thickness and histopathology.. The results showed that this new combination of 2 mg E2 and micronized progesterone in different doses was both effective and well accepted. The mean number of flashes decreased by about 50 % in these five women ( from 6.2/24 to 3.2 flushes/24 h at 36 weeks ). In the same group a score made as the product of reduction in number and severity of flushes decreased by 92 % at 12 weeks, 75 % at 24 weeks and 72 % at 36 months compared with baseline.

32187830," BACKGROUND Bile acids ( BAs ) are currently not considered a selection criteria for performing gastric restrictive or diversionary bariatric surgery. Given the role of the gut microbiota in regulating host metabolism and obesity, we investigated the effects of diets high in bile acids, which can influence glucose homeostasis and inflammation through activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion and thyroid hormones. The study was to evaluate the effect of treatment of obese subjects with orlistat, compared with controls, on fasting and post-operative bile acid concentrations in ten obese patients. The two surgical procedures induced similar and durable changes in BA synthesis.  Routine liver function tests, plasma disappearance rate of intravenously administered 3H-cholic acid and 14C-24-chenodeoxycholic acid, and the BMI. By colonizing germ-free mice with stools from the patients, we demonstrated that the surgically altered bile salts were significantly lower in both groups compared to baseline.  Total BA AUC was significantly increased at 6 ( p < 0.01 ) and 12 weeks post-op.. The ratio of total BA to the baseline was significantly higher after RYGB... : The mean plasma BAs increased after RYGB, total fecal fat, and gallbladder motility ( −25 % and −13 %, respectively ). At 1 year after the surgery, the total plasma BA levels decreased slightly with the intervention, but not significantly with placebo treatment.. Total BA levels at baseline and after 6 and 12 months were significantly higher than placebo."
28985287," BACKGROUND To investigate the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( LRYGB )  is the most common bariatric technique. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG ) is a restrictive procedure ; the metabolic and endocrine effects of which remain unknown. We compared the effects of both procedures on glucose metabolism and fasting and meal-stimulated gut hormone levels. METHODS We r and omly assigned 3234 nondiabetic persons with elevated fasting and post-load plasma glucose concentrations to placebo, metformin ( 850 mg twice daily ), or a lifestyle-modification program  with the goals of at least a 7 percent weight loss and at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week. RESULTS After two years, the weight had increased by 0.1 percent in the control group and had decreased by 23.4 percent in group ( P<0.001 ). In contrast, in Group IIb.. In Group IIb, no significant change in blood pressure or weight occurred ( P greater than 0.30 ). The incidence of diabetes was 11.0, 7.8, and 4.8 cases per 100 person-years in both the placebo, metoprolol, and lifestyle groups, respectively. The lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence by 58 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval, 48 to 66 percent ) and metformin by 31 percent ( P < 0.001 ), whereas this trend was maintained. In patients with renal impairment, eGFR improved over 5 years ( 52 ± 2 to 68 ± 7 mL/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The surgery group had lower 2- and 10-year incidence rates of diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperuricemia than thecontrol group.

26322509," BACKGROUND : Observational studies suggest that serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25[OH]D ) are inversely associated with asthma and a lower response to inhaled corticosteroids. This study aim ed to investigate the cross-sectional and prospect i ve associations between serum vitamin D levels and subsequent severe asthma exacerbations. METHODS We conducted a r and omization, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing vitamin D(3 ) supplements ( 1200 IU/d ) with placebo  in schoolchildren. The primary outcome was the incidence of influenza A, diagnosed with influenza antigen testing with a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Key limitations of observational studies include use of inappropriate controls and failure to adequately adjust for prognostic imbalance. RESULTS : Publication bias is likely frequent, and caution in the face of early results, particularly with small sample size and number of events, is warranted. KEY POINTS : : At baseline, the median serum 25(OH)D level was 7 ng/mL ( interquartile range : 5–10 ng/ml ). At the end of the trial, follow-up was 99 % ( n = 244 )..

We recently derived a whiplash CPR to consoli date previously established prognostic factors for poor recovery from a whiplash injury, and time off work in adults with acute whiplash-associated disorders. The authors hypothesized that pain relief would not differ between whiplash patients ( WP ). We conducted this three-year prospect i ve cohort study in six Canadian emergency departments. The study involved adult trauma patients who were alert and whose condition was stable. The baseline survey included 765 patients. Subsequently, 480 completed a question naire at each follow up time point, of whom 128 ( 27 % ) reported neck pain on each occasion. The outcome parameter was self-reported neck pain. In contrast, a high level of general psychological distress, pre-collision history of widespread body pain, type of vehicle, and whiplash associated symptoms. During the followup period only one patient in the study group had a complete recovery. The overall percentage of correct predictions of neck pain, including the percentage of patients requiring rescue analgesia,  was 0.78. The primary outcome was neck pain and disability ( Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) ) and the control group a relative increase of 12.5 % ( p > 0.05 ). There was no significant differences in frequency of recovery ( NDI ≤8 % ) between the intervention group and control group. The population had no significant neck pain or disability at 6 months ( OR 95 %, CI = 0.55, 0.23–1.29 ).

However, the prevalence of sedentary lifestyle is elevated after an acute coronary syndrome. We investigated the effect of a smartphone-based home service delivery ( Care Assessment Platform ) of CR ( CAP-CR ) on the effectiveness of this intervention on total wellness, cardiovascular health, and quality of life in AF patients. Methods In this unblinded controlled trial, we r and omized to an intervention group ( n=26 ) consisting of four 4-minute intervals at 85 % to 95 % of peak heart rate 3 times a week for 12 months. In initial trials, consumer wearable devices have been shown to increase physical activity and help users cope with their workload. The control group received usual medical care and follow-up. The intervention group received the same as usual care. The primary outcome measure was change in time spent undertaking moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day, assessed by accelerometer over 7 consecutive days. Secondary outcome measures were cardiorespiratory fitness, body mass, and resting blood pressure and heart rate. In contrast, groups did not differ in physical activity levels at baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months.

30634478," To investigate the role of cholesterol synthesis and absorption markers and their association with metabolic diseases. We evaluated the impact of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( LRYGB ) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ). To address this paradox, we evaluated baseline risk factors, phytosterol intake , and  plasma noncholesterol sterol levels  in participants of a case control study nested within the European Prospect i ve Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition ( EPIC ) Spanish cohort who developed CHD ( n = 299 ) and matched controls ( n= 584 ). The experimental diets included a baseline diet ( 39 % energy as fat, 164 mg chol·4.2 MJ−1 ) and five reduced-fat diets ( P = 0.026 ). Serum cholesterol levels were significantly higher in both normocholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, and levels of glucose, triglycerides, and lathosterol, a cholesterol synthesis marker, decreased across plasma sitosterol tertiles ( P < 0.02 ; all ). Compared with controls, the upper quartile of serum cholesterol levels ( > 5.25 micromol/L ) was associated with a 1.8-fold increase in risk and the lower three quartiles. This association remained significant after adjustment for age, gender, and baseline cholesterol levels. The percentage of cholesterol absorption was significantly suppressed by the 2nd to 3rd trimester of treatment. The plasma level of cholesterol metabolites were significantly associated with the presence of hypercholesterolemia. The serum non-cholesterol sterols are efficacious in lowering LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol levels in both diabetic and nondiabetic persons. The results suggest that the plasma cholesterol levels are not due to a single metabolic defect leading to increased cholesterol synthesis in patients with type 2 diabetes, therefore, their use in metabolic disturbances is questionable.."
15229625," OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy and safety of vardenafil treatment for erectile dysfunction ( ED ), who are successfully treated with intracavernous injections of  vasoactive drugs. METHODS 81 men with ED and postinjection max penile systolic velocity < 25 cm/s in repeated Doppler ultrasonography were included. Of these, 24 men started on apomorphine 2 mg and 19 on sildenafil 50 mg, the doses titrated up to 3 and 100 mg, and 53 with a mixture of PGE1 20 microg and papaverine 7.5 - 40 mg ( MIX ). After a 1-week washout period, they changed to oral sildenafil in titrating doses ( 8.5 to 41.1 ). In human volunteers, we have shown sildenafil to have suitable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties ( rapid absorption, relatively short half-life, no significant effect on heart rate and blood pressure ) for an oral agent to be taken, as required, prior to sexual activity. Moreover, in a clinical study of 12 patients with erectile function domain scores were statistically greater than placebo, irrespective of etiology, baseline severity, or age. This was seen at all dosages. The percentage of successful intercourses was between 71 and 75 % for the three vardenalafil doses. For the 20 mg dose, 80 % of the patients experienced improved erections ( GAQ ) compared to 30 % for placebo. Most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events ( headache, flushing, and dyspepsia ) were either constant or declined over time. the concentrations declined with an average terminal t1/2 of 4.2 h ( geometric SD=1.27 ), and for type 1 and 2 diabetes. Only the younger men with non-insulin-dependent diabetes..

Initially, the LSG was performed without a calibration tube and result ed in high sleeve volumes ( P less than 0.05 ). In group 2 ( n=32 ), a correction tube of 44 Fr and in group 3 ( n =63 ) a calibration-tube of 32 Fr were used. The average weight change in control subjects was less that + /-2 % during the period of up to 15 years.. The hospital length of stay was too short to assess the outcomes after LAGB. The weight had increased by 1.6 percent and decreased by 16.1 %, respectively. There were no mortalities. The mean body mass index was significantly shorter and the proportion of patients with diabetes, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. The primary end point was weight loss, and secondary end points were correction of comorbidities, early- and long-term complications, importance of food restriction, and improvement of quality of life. RESULTS : The unadjusted overall weight loss was significantly greater in patients with the Lapb and group ( P=0.04 ), but the percentage of patients who underwent LSG with type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia in severely obese adults. The surgery group had lower 2- and 10-year incidence rates of diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and uremia. The overall mortality rate was lower after bariatric surgery, with 73 % ( 95 % CI, 57.3 % ) with no significant difference between+.)..."
22353603," OBJECTIVES To evaluate the clinical performance of two simplified adhesive systems in the treatment of non-carious cervical lesions. The authors conducted a study to determine retention, anatomical form, caries, staining, marginal discoloration, marginal adaptation, surface roughness and sensitivity of a three-step etch-prime-bond adhesive ( Gluma Solid Bond, SB ). A total of 66 restorations ( 35 resin composite - RC- restorations and 35 RMGIC restorations ) were placed by a single operator in 30 patients under rubber dam isolation. The restorations were evaluated at baseline and after 6, 12 and 24 months following the modified USPHS criteria, and two calibrated examiners evaluated the restorations at baseline, 6, 18 and 36 months. The data were statistically analyzed by Fisher's exact and McNemar tests. The clinical outcome variables were evaluated every 6 months during a 2-year period for each material. The retention rates for SE-1 and SE-2 were 84.8 % and 90.9 %, respectively. The trial restorations of both groups were evaluated blind to each other. The results were statistically significant differences for marginal integrity, color match, anatomic form, pre- and post-operative sensitivity, surface texture and fracture at baseline. The percentage agreement between examiners was at least 83 percent for each criterion in each evaluation period. CONCLUSIONS Both the etch- and -rinse adhesive were as clinical ly effective as conventional adhesives ( etch-and -rinse ). The one-step self-etch, the other one turned out to be significantly better than the conventional adhesive - two-step adhesive. The adhesive system ( Single Bond ) that was evaluated showed a good clinical effectiveness in treating the majority of the lesions.. The simplified adhesive ( Self-etch ) are as clinical relevancy and the single-step re-etch ; Two-step- and-rinse. and.)."
11580867," One hundred and fifty children aged between 2 and 9 years with bilateral SOM were allocated at r and om to three groups : Adeno-tonsillectomy ( 47 cases ), adenoidectomy (47 cases ) and neither procedure ( 53 cases ). A double-blind controlled trial compared the effects of early treatment with ventilation tubes versus watchful waiting for 9 months. The trial was undertaken to assess whether either preparation, alone or in combination, would reduce the number of children requiring surgical treatment for this condition. The number of operations performed during the course of the disease was used as a surrogate for chronicity.. Of the 28 patients with a history of previous aural discharge at presentation were significantly more likely to have chronic OME. Although it appeared that patients treated with Mucodyne were 1.68 times more probable to undergo resolution of OME than patients receiving placebo.. There was a significant clearance of middle ear fluid, change from no peak to peak impedance measurement and hearing gain as a result of both procedures.. The main outcome measures were behavioural problems, measured by the Richman Behaviour Checklist, and hearing loss at 4000 Hz. The absolute risk difference in the study was 8.5 % ( 95 % C.I., -3 - 20 ). We can not exclude the possibility that adenoidectomy with improved expectation for resolution of SOM if cases are selected with the help of these two variables. They also suggest in which cases the operation should not be recommended. Despite the trends in outcome favouring the combined approach, the majority of children in this study still had behavioural problems.

22161405," BACKGROUND The efficacy and tolerability of the new antidepressant mirtazapine were evaluated in a multicentre, r and omized, double-blind, parallel-group study in patients with major depression. The authors'primary objectives in this study were to evaluate the efficacy of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( citalopram ) and placebo, using measurement-based care in actual practice, and to identify predictors of symptom remission in adult depressed patients. RESULTS The clinical study included 8 weeks of treatment with either citalopram ( 20 - 60 mg/day ) or sertraline ( 50 - 150 mg/ day ). The patients received flexible doses of citalopram. The primary outcome was the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( HAM-D ), while the primary statistical analysis was an analysis of variance comparing the change from baseline in Ham-D-17 score. Other significant differences were in the proportion of patients classified as responders ( 50 % decrease from baseline Ham- D-17 scores ) at Day 14 and in remission ( 67 % ). Secondary outcome measures included measures of depression ( including response and remission ), anxiety, pain, safety ( e.g., blood pressure ). In the present study, the treatment groups were similar in terms of efficacy, the HAMD score decreased from almost identical initial values ( 22.0 + /- 1.1 for hypericum and 22.1 +/- 1,1 points for sertroline ) to 8.3 + / - 5.5 points ( hypericum ) and 8.1 ± 1.5 % of trials funded by for-profit organizations ( P<.001 ; chi2 test ).

26081915," BACKGROUND : The presence of bile acids ( BA ) is an important transcriptional regulator of liver metabolism. Our hypothesis is that changes in bile flow due to the altered anatomy may partly explain the metabolic outcomes of the operation. We assessed outcomes 5 years after the introduction of bariatric surgery, including the effects of BA. We prospectively studied 12 patients who had type 2 diabetes and a body‐mass index ( BMI ), to assess the role of BAs. The study assessed fasting and post-operative time-points ( 3, 6 and 12 months ). All mice were observed post-surgery, and data for body weight, body composition, metabolic parameters, serum bile acid level and composition were collected.. The primary outcome was a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.0 % or less with or without the use of diabetes medications. RESULTS Of the 150 patients who underwent r and omization, 1 patient died during the 5-year follow‐up period. The majority of patients ( 57 % ) had reduced fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and total cholesterol. The postoperative ( postop ) time point, patients had increased cholic and tauroursodeoxycholic acid. The metabolic improvements in patients with poor weight loss after gastric bypass, the total / HDL cholesterol ratio was significantly decreased ( −11 % ) compared to baseline in hypercholesterolemic ( n=12 ) but not in normocholesterolemic ( P = 0.2962 ). The ratio of fasting to postprandial plasma BA was higher in obese patients than in the control group. The clinical significance : Bariatric surgery is currently the most efficacious treatment for obesity and its associated metabolic co-morbidities, especially with respect to weight-dependent and -independent mechanisms.. This systematic review assesses the evidence from both human and animal studies for the impact of obesity and related metabolic complications on the recovery of obesity.A.-). and "
21053026," Study Design. A population -based cross-sectional and 5-year prospect i ve question naire study. Objective. To investigate the effectiveness of the self-reported physical activity as a risk factor for low back pain. Summary of Background Data. The study was conducted in a cluster-r and omized controlled trial with three study arms via question naires and patient interviews. We analysed the level of aerobic fitness in these patients. Results : The pilot version was first developed, based on epidemiological principles, and then compared with an age-matched group of pain-free individuals ( n = 57 ). Participants free from LBP at baseline ( no LBP during the past month, N = 1387 ) were included and interview data on overall physical activity, and assessment of grip strength, overall cognitive function, and depression. At all measuring points, pain intensity ratings and disability scores were compared between men and women.. The outcome was compared between the 2 groups. The physical activity levels were significantly associated -- both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The correlations with the diaries were 0.56 in men and 0.44 in women. The Quality Index had high internal consistency ( KR-20 : 0.89 ) as did the subscales apart from external validity. The prevalence of correct predictions was 69.3 %. During the follow-ups, the corresponding indicators of  the home exercise group remained below baseline values. This systematic review investigated the relationships between free living activity levels  after onset of back pain ( LBP ) and measures of pain, and disability in patients with NSLBP. The patients who stopped the test prematurely were older ( P = 0.02 ) and more disabled (."
30287245," BACKGROUND During speech perception, the ability to integrate auditory and visual information causes speech to sound louder and be more intelligible, and leads to quicker processing. This integration is important in early language development, and also continues to affect speech comprehension throughout the lifespan. AIM AND METHOD A preferential looking paradigm was used, where participants viewed non-linguistic, simple linguistic or complex linguistic events on two screens displaying identical video tracks, but one offset from the other by 3 seconds, and with the single audio track matched to only one of the displays. The stimuli were video clips of complete phrases using simple, commonly occurring words. The clips were digitally manipulated to have the video precede the corresponding audio by 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 video frames. We also found that individuals with autism were significantly worse than those in the comparison group at lipreading... Among the adults with autism, this apparently autism-specific, language -specific pattern of responding to temporal synchrony, and potential developmental sequelae are discussedBACKGROUND: & NA ; An ever‐growing literature has aim ed to determine how individuals with Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) differ from their typically developing ( TD ) peers on measures of multisensory integration ( MSI ) and to ascertain the degree to which differences in MSI are associated to autism. Findings, however, have been highly variable across the studies carried out to date. The present work systematic ally review s and quantitatively synthesizes the large literature on audiovisual MSI  in individuals with ASD and TD peers to evaluate the cumulative evidence that may moderate findings ( i.e., explain differential effects ) observed across studies."
28376055," The daily supplementation of vitamin D supplementation in infancy is required to support healthy bone mineral accretion. This was a prospect i ve and omized study performed at primary care clinics. This study was performed on 120 healthy breastfed infants to compare plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25[OH]D ) concentrations between 40 and 50 IU per day. One hundred and sixty-nine infants were r and omly assigned to two groups with different doses of vitamin d3 ( 400 IU/day ) and a control group. Data on diarrheal episodes ( ≥3 loose/liquid stools in 24 hours ) was gathered through active and passive surveillance. The objective of this study was to determine if a dose-response relationship exists between infant vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D status, and bone outcomes at 3 years of age. At 3 and 6 months of age, serum 25OHD levels ( ±SD ) were significantly higher ( P <.001 ) in the prophylaxis group. In the group without prophylaxis, serum vitamin D levels were higher than placebo. The incidence of diarrheal episodes were insufficient : 68 ( 53–83 ) nmol/l in each group. 6 weeks later levels were comparable in all three groups ( median, 53 nmol/liter ). A few complications such as diarrhoea and agitation, all of which were self-limited.

25793643," Objective : To evaluate whether comprehensive postdischarge care management is effective in reducing recurrent stroke. We tested the hypothesis that a nurse-led preventive cardiology programme could improve the outcome of stroke survivors. The study was a single-centre controlled trial in which 47 patients with a TIA or minor stroke were r and omized to either a treatment group or a control group. The intervention group received a 6-week structured care intervention, the control group received usual care, and the group received an individualized multimedia computer program ( IMCP ). All patients received information about their disease from their treating neurologist and half of the patients received extra information through the IMCP. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who adhered to the recommended measures at 12-month postdischarge. The secondary outcomes were the incidence of recurrent stroke, and at 3 months following the intervention. The trial was registered as IS RCT. The mean baseline BP was significantly lower than expected. The majority of patients in the study group ( 92 % ) had no significant difference in DeltaSBP over 6 months. Secondary outcomes were : self-efficacy ( 1–10 ), anxiety and depression ( 0–21 ), and number of walks taken ( P = 0.001 ). There were no significant improvements for the primary endpoint of this study. The percentage of intervention patients reaching target systolic blood pressure ( sBP ) of 140 mmHg after 12 months tended to be greater than in those who did not. The control group ( p=0.11 ). The incidence of secondary prevention interventions was lower. The cohort study showed that patients with TIA/stroke had a significant increase in daily physical activity and a significant decrease in salt intake ( 1.0 %, 95 % CI 0.3 to 1.7, p= 0.009 ). We undertook a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of multimodal interventions to improve stroke outcomes in a population with a highA.)."
24346781," OBJECTIVE To compare the effects of epidural anesthesia and general anesthesia on postoperative outcomes in elderly patients. The first group had their operations under general anesthesia ( GA ). The second group was r and omly allocated to receive either general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia. The patients in the control group received a standard general anaesthesia. The postoperative outcomes were compared between the two groups. The mean age of the patients was 64 years. The incidence of postoperative complications was similar between two cohorts.. Closed suction drains were used and all blood lost after the operation collected for measurement. The estimated blood loss was not statistically significant. The outcome of patients who had the same postoperative pain was found to be similar between groups.  The epidural anesthesia group reached all rehabilitative milestones earlier postoperatively than did the general anesthesia group, with a statistically significant earlier attainment of stair climbing.. the incidence of deep vein thrombosis was 40 % with epidural anesthesia, and 48 % with general anesthesia... The type of anesthesia, there is controversy about the beneficial effects of neuraxial anesthesia for orthopedic surgery. The aim of this study was to compare to the effectiveness and safety of regional anesthesia versus general anesthesia for total knee replacement.. A minor reduction in postoperative deep venous thrombosis rate was observed with neuraxial anesthesia, but this did not reach statistical significance."
27859327," Among policymakers, a common perception surrounding the effects of cash transfer programs can have positive impacts on  adolescent transitions to adulthood in re source poor setting s, however existing research is typically from small scale programs in diverse geographic and cultural setting s. We provide estimates of the impact of a national unconditional cash  Transfer program, the Kenya Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children , on pregnancy and early marriage among females aged 12 to 24, four years after program initiation. The evaluation was design ed as a clustered r and omized controlled trial and ran from 2007 to 2011, capitalizing on the existence of a control group, which was delayed entry to the program due to budget constraints. Findings indicate that, among 1549 females included in the study, while the programme reduced the likelihood of pregnancy by five percentage points, there was no significant impact on likelihood of early marriage. Program impacts on pregnancy appear to work through increasing the enrollment of young women in school, financial stability of their household and delayed age at first sex. The Kenyan program is similar in design to most other major national cash transfers, but may also reduce sexual activity, teen pregnancy, and early menopause."
21890437," A 2-year milk intervention trial was carried out with 757 girls, aged 10 years, from nine primary schools in Beijing ( April 1999 - March 2001 ). Schools were r and omised into three groups : group 1, 238 girls consumed a carton of 330 ml milk fortified with Ca on school days over the study period ; group 2, 260 girls received the same quantity of milk additionally fortified with 5 or 8 microg cholecalciferol ;  group 3, 259 control girls.  Anthropometric and bone mineralisation measurements, as well as dietary, health and physical-activity data, were collected at baseline and after 12 and 24 months of the trial. Over the 2- year period the consumption of this milk, with or without added choleciferol, led to significant increases in the changes in height ( > or = 0.6 % ), weight ( > 0.8 % ). The mean difference in weight gain was 130 g ( P greater than 0.05 ) in their favour. The height and weight gain associated with the provision of free mild was very small in this study population, and it is therefore likely that the benefit to growth of providing free milk for the whole unselected population of schoolchildren of these ages would be even smaller. The positive relationship between per capita availability of dairy products and average  height  found in historical studies ( for instance in nineteenth century Bavaria, Prussia and France ; Baten, 2009 ) does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship. Historical studies usually apply non-experimental methods that may produce substantial bias. Modern experimental controlled studies may provide high quality evidence supporting the effect of supplementing usual diet with dairy products on physical growth. The results indicate that an increase in milk consumption, e.g. by means of school milk programmes, would improve bone growth during adolescence the end of supplementation and total body bone mass.. The dietary calcium intake was a major public health problem ; 40 % of women will sustain an osteoporotic fracture.... High quality evidence for this relationship between dairy products at or above the recommended dietary allowances had an increased rate of bone mineral content."
28034901," OBJECTIVES A high body mass index has been suggested to be protective in patients with coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ). The contradictory findings in the literature may largely be attributable to the variety of method ological approaches used to model the association between body fat index ( BMI ) and post-CABG outcomes. This study aims to investigate this association, and to uncover possible explanations for the lack of consensus across prior studies. METHODS Data were prospect ively collected on 80,792 patients who underwent a CABG procedure during a 14-year period at the 45 Department of Veterans Affairs cardiac surgery programs.  Generalized additive models were used the study sample consisted of 3269 normal weight, 6662 overweight, 3821 obese, and 211 morbidly obese patients. After matching, early mortality was not affected by overweight ( mean difference, 0.7 % ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], -0.2 % to 1.5 % ), obesity ( mean Difference, 0-5 % ; P =.9 % ), class I obese ( 30 to 34.9 kg/m(2 ) ) and class II/III obese ( greater-than-or-equal 35 kg/ m(2 )). In-hospital complications and short- and long-term mortalities were compared between levels of BMI within each mode of initial revascularization. Obese patients showed a higher risk of a major in-hospital event ( death, myocardial infa rct ion, stroke, coma ). Among patients who had CABG, no difference in this outcome was observed according to BMI. In contrast, morbidity and mortality were lower in obese patients undergoing cardiac surgery , although the nature of the obesity paradox was unclear. In summary"
32176779," BACKGROUND. The efficacy of amiodarone is used commonly for the management of atrial fibrillation ( AF ). We studied the clinical correlates and the effect of rhythm-control strategy on AF. METHODS In a prospect i ve, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, we investigated the safety of acute oral loading dose of amiodarone compared with placebo, in patients with recent-onset AF. A total of 152 patients with AF or AF of 3 - 48 hours duration were followed up for 12 months.. Patients were excluded because of ventricular response rate lower than 100 or higher than 200 beats/minute.  Amiodarone is also a class III antiarrhythmic agent that when given intravenously or orally has proved to be more effective than other agents in terminating AF and Af. RESULTS The patients received either 24 h amiodarone infusion ( loading dose 5 mg/kg followed by maintenance dose of 50 mg/h ; n = 60 ), or amiodarone infusion at the same dosage plus a single oral dose of quinidine ( n = 92 ). The mean delay from first trial drug to sinus rhythm with the two groups was 10.2 + /- 7.6 hours, respectively ( P <.001 )... The conversion rate during 24 h of treatment in the amiodarone group was 92 % ( P<0.001 ), whereas the mean length of stay was 7.2 ± 3.3 vs. 13.3 ± 4.1 h ( P = 0.001 )... Of the 18 patients who did not convert with quinidine, 15 ( 85 % ), were found to have undergone successful cardioversion. The most effective antidysrhythmic drug for pharmacologic cardioversion was the combination of amiodarone and hydrochlorothiazide. The majority of patients ( 90 % ) in this study were in stable sinonasal rhythm...-).-. "
31885541," Background : Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is the most common chronic liver disease in the world. The effect of probiotics and omized placebo-controlled trials on the glycemic parameters and adipokines in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of probiotic supplementation on liver enzymes, the proton-density-fat-fraction ( MRI-PDFF ), and other parameters in type 2 diabetes patients. Methods : This double-blind clinical trial was conducted on 42 patients with NAFLDs who had been referred to a gastroenterology clinic. The supplementation of probiotics ( Protexin two tablets per day ) or placebo capsules for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in intrahepatic triglyceride content ( IHTG ), followed by changes in liver enzyme, and liver enzymes. The following variables were assessed at −4 ( beginning of the dietary lead-in period ), 0 ( r and omization ), 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks : aspartate transaminase ( AST ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ), leptin, and mRNA levels of inflammation-related genes ( ALT, low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) ). In the probiotic group, insulin, insulin resistance, and LDL-cholesterol was reduced significantly at the end of treatment. The mean values of ALP, albumin, and the ratio of ALP to the control group were not significantly different. Conclusion : The probiotic supplementation improved liver function, total cholesterol, and HOMA-IR, compared with the placebo group. The probiotic treatment was considered as a potential therapy for nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases ( NALD ) without approval and comprehensive assessment in recent years, which call for a meta- analysis."

A total of 34 children with ADHD as defined by DSM-IV-TR were randomized to receive either MPH ( 0.3 mg/kg twice daily ) or placebo. The participants ( 6 - 17 years old ) with a baseline ADHD Rating Scale ( ADHD-RS-IV ) total score ≥ 28 were included to the study.  Dextroamphetamine, a new selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and the placebo.  Treatment outcomes were assessed using the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression- Severity Scale. Subjects were recruited from an outpatient child and adolescent clinic for a 6 week double blind, r and omized clinical trial. The primary efficacy variable was the comparison of response rates ( ≥40 % reduction from baseline to end point in total scores ). The results indicated that placebo group ( LDX, n = 104 ; placebo, n= 106 ; OROS-MPH. The difference between the 2 groups was statistically significant. The mean difference between placebo and placebo group was 0.95 ( 20 mg/day for < 30 kg and 300 mg/ day for > 30 kg ). the primary efficacy outcome was that the ADHD treatment group had the highest total ADHD score. The differences between two groups were significant at the endpoint and at follow-up. The average difference in treatment outcomes were not significant in terms of the parent and Teacher Rating Scale scores. The study is to gather evidence of head-to-head double-blind, single-dose, and single-blind trials of aripiprazole and to explore the effects of treatment with aripiprazole and/or carvedilol.

15803086," Study Design. A prospect i ve cohort study was conducted to investigate the psychometric properties of a Dutch translation of the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, MPI-DLV. Data was available on 733 patients with chronic low back pain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictive validity of a subgroup classification based on the type of measure of treatment effect, their pain and disability at 3 and 12 months were compared. The results showed that the majority of patients had decreased pain intensity ratings ( mean 10 % ), increased lifting ability ( 6–8 kg ), and a 59.2 % return-to-work rate at a mean of 9.7 months follow-up. Methods. Patients were classified as either central izers or non central. The outcome variables were absence from work ( defined as sick listing plus early retirement ), general health status, and utilization of health care re sources. Results. The optimized cutoff points for tumour thickness were significantly associated to the outcome of multidisciplinary rehabilitation-or back school treatment. This improvement was seen across the variety of outcomes evaluated, including narcotic medication use. Most important, the MPI subgroup classification did not significantly predict the degree of positive treatment outcome ; all subgroups improved. Conclusion. Although there were major differences in predictors from multiple domains ( i.e., sociodemographic, physical, and psychological ), they were not affected by compensation. For patients completing the spine rehabilitation program, a comprehensive interdisciplinary treatment program may achieve its full effectiveness across a wide array of pain/disability-related outcome variables, regardless of initial MPI profile.

30364990," Background : Some recent reports suggest an increased risk of fractures with use of proton pump inhibitors ( PPIs ) and histamine type 2 receptor antagonists ( H2RAs ), although results are inconsistent and a causal relationship has yet to be proven. As these acid-suppressive drugs may have uncommon adverse effects on the central nervous system ( CNS ), such as dizziness, we investigated whether their use is associated with falls as a possible mechanism for increasing fracture risk. Methods We studied 9,423 participants in the B-PROOF ( B-vitamins for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures ) study were used, concerning community-dwelling elderly aged ≥65 years. We included 2,407 participants with pharmacy dispensing records. During the 2- to 3-year follow-up, participants recorded falls.. The overall incidence of falls per 1000 person-years was 13.0 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 12.9–13.1 ). After adjustment for potential confounders, there was no relationship between falls and current use of single PPIs ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 0.95 ; 95 % CI 1.28–1.65 for hip fractures ; and OR = 1.60, 95 %CI 1.25–2.04 for spine fractures ). Similarly, non-selective beta-blocker use was associated with a decreased fracture risk if they had been used within the last year ( OR = 2.7 ) and dizziness ( p < 0.001 ) and numbness of feet ( p =.017 ). Inappropriate use of PPIs are associated with substantial cost expenditure and with the potential for adverse events. Although the increased risk found was modest, this finding is important, given the high prevalence of PPI use and the excess morbidity and mortality associated with osteoporosis-related fractures."
28459099," OBJECTIVES The purpose was to determine if a 12-week weight loss intervention with a physical activity ( PA ) component would lead to changes in steps/day, step count accumulation patterns, and peak cadence. METHODS Currently inactive adults ( N=25 ; 76 % female ; age=34±13yr ) completed a moderate intensity treadmill walking trial, during which cadence and steady-state O2 were measured. Treadmill VO2  was measured using indirect calorimetry.  Stride rate and walking tempo were recorded during overground-walking trials.. A total of 2803 adults 18 years or older completed interviews from 4831 telephone contacts ( response rate, 58.0 % ), and after 1 year, 1423 individuals ( 55 % ) completed interviews. Measures. Demographic, physical activity, Guide awareness. Analysis. Chi-square, analysis of variance... During self-paced brisk walking cadence was 124±8stepsmin(-1 ).. Regression analyses detected a positive association between socioeconomic status and health-related quality of life ( p =.01 ), but the strength of the association declined ( p <.05, d=1.23 ). From the Bl and -Altman plots, 23 participants had valid data ( 44 in the DE+PA  group ). Most adults choose walking as a leisure activity. However, many do not reach the international physical activity guidelines for adults, which recommend moderate intensity aerobic activity for at least 150 minutes/week in bouts of 10 minutes. Purpose. This systematic review provides an up date on the walking cadence required to reach moderate intensity in adults and older adults. The majority of those surveyed were not familiar with the PA program or walking cadence for adults or older adults, and evaluates how walking cadence intensity should be measured to achieve moderate intensity..). and.. The main purpose is to report the interventions that have been attempted to promote walking cadence to increase time spent at moderate intensity or other outcomes for adults and young adults."

26378571," BACKGROUND AND AIMS Virgin olive oil ( VOO ) and nuts are important components of the Mediterranean diet, a heart-healthy dietary pattern.. We have examined the effect of three diets, with different fat composition, on the activation of NF-kappaB, on peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( P BMC s ). We investigated the effects of two enhanced MDs on inflammatory biomarkers related to atherosclerosis and vascular function in subjects at high risk of CVD. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 2 parallel groups, 50 overweight subjects were r and omized to receive daily supplementation with 2 g of fish oil ( 1.1 g marine n-3 PUFA ) or placebo.. At the end of this period, we measured macrovascular ( brachial ultrasound of flow-mediated dilatation ; FMD ) and microvascular [ laser-Doppler measurements of reactive hyperemia ( RH ) ]. Plasma fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography to assess compliance. In 18 participants completing the study ( 9 women, mean age 56 y, BMI 25.7 kg/m(2 ) ), plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein, soluble thrombomodulin, E-selectin, von Willebr and factor antigen, and urinary microalbumin and isoprostane excretion were unaffected by treatment.. Total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol decreased by 3.3 mm Hg ( 95 % CI -6.1 to -0.6 ; P = 0.01 ). The results also indicate that the low dose of n-6 PUFA used in many intervention trials does not have deleterious effects on sCAMs or hsCRP. The aim of  the present systematic review was to synthesize data from randomized controlled trials investigating the roles of olive oil on markers of inflammation or endothelial function."
15513655," Study Design. A prospect i ve cohort study with identical question naires and inclusion criteria was performed. Objectives. To determine whether the use of a mini-intervention, provided in addition to the usual care, and to identify the effects of a work site visit for patients with subacute disabling low back pain. Summary of Background Data. The study population consisted of patients who had been examined by an orthopedic surgeon and a social worker. In this experiment, patients were referred to a hospital for back pain, and a control group ( n = 52 ). During the baseline measurement, information was collected about the patients’ history of LBP, occupational variables, job characteristics and social economic variables. At the second interview, 66 % of the subjects were asked to complete a question naire design, and use of  opioids for more than 7 days. The experts included were those connected with patients participating in the larger outcome study. The presence of nonresponse bias was investigated through logistic regression and wave analysis. The control group was not examined at the clinic, but was treated with conventional primary health care. Results. The age‐st and ardized lifetime prevalence of neck pain was 66.7 % ( 95 % confidence interval, 63.8‐69.5 ) and the point prevalence is 22.2 % (95 % CI 19.7‐24.7 ). The prediction analyses showed that the treated group reported significantly fewer contacts with the health care system and significantly fewer days of sick leave over the 5-year follow-up period. In all other parameters, including work ability, there was no statistically significant difference ( Group A vs. Group C, P = 0.056 ).. The total score was not significantly different between the 2 groups..A). and}-."""
17923590," PURPOSE We compared the therapeutic efficacy of intravesical pentosanpolysulphate ( PPS ) with placebo for the symptomatic therapy of interstitial cystitis ( IC ). A total of 110 patients with IC were enrolled and treated for three months. A r and omized to 90 minutes treatment in a hyperbaric chamber pressurized with 100 % O2 to 2.4 atmosphere absolute for 30 treatments sessions and the other 10 received a placebo.  Symptomatic relief and objective variables ( bladder capacity voiding volumes and urinary frequency ) were assessed after 3 months. Patients had at least a 6-month history of pain, nocturia, urgency and symptoms of pelvic pain during the last month were obtained. The primary end point was a patient reported global response assessment. Secondary end points included pain, urgency, vali date d IC symptom indexes and adverse events. The target sample size was 260 participants, and treatment was discontinued to 1 patient in the placebo group. The 36 % of patients who withdrew from study or were lost to followup were more likely to have had more severe symptoms at baseline.. The results suggest that intravesical PPS is an effective option for treating tuberculosis, M avium complex, and other mycobacterial disease.  Photographs of bladder sites before and after treatment with 890+/-140 ml. were scored as 1.4 + /- 0.3 ( before distention ) and 3.1+/-1.1 ( after distention.

26163249," A placebo-controlled, single-blind study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus plantarum strain GG ( ATCC 53103 ), on the clinical effect on atopic eczema. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a probiotic strain L-92 ( LP-33 ) on nasal symptoms of Japanese cedar pollinosis ( JCP ). In a r and omized, double-blind trial between 2000 and 2007 in Helsinki, Finland, we administered a placebo or tablets containing 100 mg of L. gasseri OLL2809, for 6 weeks. The study was a double-blinded, parallel, randomized controlled trial. The outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. The percentage of patients with nasal symptoms and self-care measures were recorded daily and the scores of nasal symptoms. Oral administration of probiotics significantly increased the nasal symptoms scores and those at intake level in the placebo group. The results indicate that oral administration of probiotic and placebo groups significantly decreased the symptoms of AR.. The median ( interquartile range ) frequency of specific antibody-secreting cells against dietary antigens increased during the probiotic treatment. The overall quality of life score decreased for groups A and B, than in healthy non-sensitized children ( p = 0.009 ). FE(NO ) correlated positively with serum total and allergen-specific IgE concentrations. We suggest that probiotics and pre-biotics can improve the prognosis of AR, and probiotics can provide a potential strategy for the management of AR."
23162042," OBJECTIVE To investigate the feasibility and effects of the 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis I ( MPS I ). STUDY DESIGN This was a r and omized controlled trial.. The study included patients with MPS I administered 100 U/kg ( 0.58 mg/kg ) laronidase, or placebo intravenously weekly for 26 weeks. The co primary efficacy end points compared the median change from baseline to week 26 between groups ( 01 - 01 - 1990 to 31 - 12 - 2006 ). The 6MWD test was tested first in 31 children with CF ( mean age, 12.0 years ), who had a mean ( range ) baseline forced expired volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) of 64 % ( 18 - 94 % ) of predicted values. The follow-up was then compared with the baseline. The patients who received the placebo showed no significant differences in any outcome measures, except for an increased between-group difference after intervention in the Short Form-36 mental health subscale and the maximum speed during the treadmill test. CONCLUSIONS The Six-Minute Walk Test ( 6MWD ) was increasingly being used as a functional outcome measure for chronic pediatric conditions. The sensitive search filter was able to retrieve 113 of these 116 studies ( sensitivity 97.4 %, precision 4.4 percent ).  The precise search filter had a sensitivity of 93.1 % and a precision of 9.4%.. Conclusion The use of this study was to systematic ally review all published clinimetric studies on the sixMWT in chronic pediatric populations. The SixMWT, VO2, HR, and V.E increased slightly ( 6 to 10 %, p < 0.05 ) at peak exercise and significantly at ventilatory threshold level ( 5.3 % ) in this population.

30687553," OBJECTIVE Treatments for the cognitive impairments of schizophrenia are urgently needed. We developed and tested a 12-week, group-based, manualized, compensatory cognitive training intervention targeting prospect i ve memory, attention, learning/memory, and executive functioning. The intervention focused on compensatory strategies, such as calendar use, self-talk, note taking, and a 6-step problem-solving method, and did not require computers. METHOD In a r and omized controlled trial, 69 out patients with schizophrenia on regular antipsychotic medication completed ≥ 32 BFP training sessions over 8 - 10 weeks. Training effects on cognitive performance and functional capacity outcome measures were measured using CogState ® schizophrenia battery, UCSD Performance based Skills Assessment ( UPSA-2 ), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ), and Cognitive Assessment Interview ( CAI ). Results : A total of 224 patients completed neurocognitive assessment s at baseline and at 12 weeks, and 81 patients also completed them at 52 weeks. Neurocognitive composite scores were calculated from the neurocognitive battery used in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness ( CATIE ). The two groups did not differ in total score changes on measures of cognitive performance, symptom severity, functional capacity, and self-rated quality of life, cognitive problems, and strategy use. These results suggest that those with lower baseline functioning may have more room to improve following CT. The pattern of correlations in this sample indicated that many types of individuals can improve with CT treatment, including older patients.  Composite z score improvements on the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia were 0.19 for olanzapine, 0.34 for quetiapine, and 0.22 for risperidone."

We included 52 diabetes patients to assess the effect of two SMS strategies on glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) levels compared to usual care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 339 out patients with diabetes at a federally funded community health center were enrolled in a three-arm trial. The mean number of years since the diagnosis of diabetes was 11.5, and 40 % of the patients had already had a cardiovascular event. The intervention was applied for six months. The goal of this study was to keep patients’ health status, and physical activity ( medical records and patient question naires ). The outcome was self-reported diabetes care. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ), and blood pressure levels. The secondary outcomes were Hb level, the number of hospital admissions, total hospital charges per patient, and outcomes ( behavioral, functional, and metabolic ). RESULTS Compared with the usual care group, the ATSM and GMV groups showed improvements in PACIC, with effect sizes of 0.19 ( SD = 0.001 ) and 0.50 ( 0.024 ), respectively.

31093862," Background Obesity is associated with a low- grade inflammatory state and increased adipose tissue. The incidence of hypoglycemia after  laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG )  is still under investigation. The aim of our study was to verify the effect of oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ), tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ), and to identify any baseline predictors of its occurrence. The study was a prospective cohort study of morbidly obese patients who underwent LSG.  Clinical data, biochemical markers of inflammation, and parameters indicative of cardiovascular risk were collected preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively.. The cohort has been followed using a combination of in-person interviews and record linkage with various registries..  Plasma PTX3  increased by 178.8 and 214.9 % ( P<0.0001 ), respectively, 6 and 12 months after surgery... In the whole group, IL-6 values were more closely related to the parameters evaluating insulin resistance than leptin, whereas CD40L. At T12, subjects showed a higher median level of all types of MP, except endothelial-derived MP, compared to T3, but without a statistically significant difference. There was a positive correlation between the changes in C-IMT, type II diabetes mellitus ( P = 0.001 ) and serum hepcidin,. The reductions of leukocyte-derived, TF- and CD36+MP were significantly correlated with the reduction of leptin. The reduced levels of IL6 and TNF-α levels all influence adiponectinemia in normal-weight women.

29257898," The goal of this study was to compare the effects of two nonpharmacological treatments for children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ).. The study examined the treatment benefits of a behavioral parent training ( CWMT ) for children diagnosed with ADHD, their parents, and a control group. The present investigation r and omized to a waitlist control group to the Coaching Our Acting-out Children :  Heightening Essential Skills ( COACHES ) program. The results also revealed greater improvement in the area of academic achievement and parent ratings of child behavior. Results indicated that fathers in treatment groups had significantly improved their ADHD symptoms, parent and clinician ratings of ADHD, and child total deviant behaviors. Both mothers and fathers reported treatment effects for children's externalizing, hyperactivity, inattentive and oppositional behaviors, and parent-related outcomes. Although not statistically significant, the group-level change and normalization rates were significantly greater than the control group on measures of inattention, organization, social skills, and family functioning. The primary outcome was the parent-rated DSM ADHD symptoms on the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham ( SNAP ) scale and Home Situations Question naire ( HSQ ).

20149117," Previous studies have found a small association between the level of blood glucose  and subjective reports of energy in those sitting quietly.  Experiment one considered the short-term effect of a glucose containing drink on mood in young adults : a glucose drink in the morning and higher blood glucose levels were both associated with feeling less tense. In three studies, with three cognitive tasks, the Stroop Task, Rapid Information Processing Task, and a difficult test of h and -eye coordination, falling blood glucose values were associated with reports of less transension. In an early view issue of this journal, Yu and co-workers ( 1 ) published a systematic review and meta- analysis about the mutual relationship between obesity and intelligence quotient ( IQ ). The authors observed that a lower IQ score in childhood was associated with obesity in later adulthood. Although it is not possible to definitively rule out reverse causation in  the IQ – obesity relationship, two main mechanisms have been put forward by the authors that could explain why a low IQ has been found to be a predictor of obesity. First, higher intelligence may reduce the risk of obesity by promoting more healthful behaviours. For example, data from a cohort study showed that children with higher IQ score than those with lower IQ scores reported significantly less obesity in earlier adulthood... Since there is not a conclusive evidence of a reverse causation or that adolescents with higher than average IQ score reported significantly more frequent consumption of fruit and vegetables and more high-intensity physical activity participation in adulthood ( 2 ). A careful examination of computer-related activities reveals that they represent a particular type of sedentary activities later in life. With the advent of computers and new technologies, however, the pendulum has swung far in to the direction of excessive mental activities, as opposed to excessive physical activities. A carefully examined of computer and other computer- related activities reveals, that we represent a specific type and sedentary activities ; they are stressful and biologically dem and ing for the body and deserve to avoid by an adequate physical activity regimen ( 10 )."
31485910," Although iron therapy is essential to optimize use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESA ), r and omized, controlled trials have heretofore been unavailable to evaluate reliably the efficacy of intravenous iron as an adjuvant to ESA treatment in peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) patients. This study examines the effects of a maintenance intravenous iron dextran ( ivID ) protocol that increased hemoglobin and hemoglobin levels and ESA and iron doses were compared with placebo. The study included 14,078 United States patients on dialysis initiating dialysis between 2003 and 2008.. The primary analysis compared the mean change in phosphorus  between ferric citrate and placebo during the placebo control period. A sequential gatekeeping strategy controlled study -wise type 1 error for serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and intravenous iron and erythropoietin-stimulating agent usage as prespecified secondary outcomes. Results : The primary end point was the change in hemoglobin from baseline to day 35. Secondary end points included the incidence of infections, hospitalizations, and mortality.. At the end of treatment, there was a significant 35 % reduction in hemoglobin between baseline and day 35 compared with those with a low ferritin level. The risks of CCVD, infection, and hospitalization were significantly higher among patients who were treated with intravenous iron ( 1.6 + /- 1.3 g/dl ). Subjects on ferric citrate received higher mean iron doses ( ferritin=899±488 ng/ml [ mean±SD ] versus 26.8 [ 13.4 - 47.6 ] mg/month... In addition, the percentage of patients who did not receive intravenous iron was higher in the study group ( P<0.001 ).

Our study aim ed to assess the impact of physician reinforcement using bone turnover markers ( BTMs ) on persistence with risedronate treatment. METHODS H and search es of journals were compared with retrievals from EMBASE for c and i date search strategies. Consecutive post-menopausal women aged 50 years to 86 years starting treatment with raloxifene according to daily practice were enrolled from 126 primary care offices in Spain. The women were assigned to two study groups. Group A received an educational leaflet with general information about osteoporosis ; group B followed current practice. To assess adherence to medication and HRQOL, the Morisky test and the EuroQoL question naire were administered. RESULTS In the overall efficacy population ( n=366 ), the ib and ronate/PSP group compared with the alendronate group ( p < 0.0001 ). The estimated proportion of patients persisting with treatment at 6 months was 56.6 % ( 306/541 ) and 38.6 percent ( 198/513 ) in the ibuprofen and ronide/PSP and alendronate groups, respectively. Compared with alendronate, this proportion at the 12-month visit was 47.4 % ( P=0.15 ) and 52.5 % (.. ). A practical dosing recommendation, derived from these findings and reflective of the long‐term nature of treatment, is that patients take the drug with water after an overnight fast and at least 30 minutes before any other food or beverage.

26487439," The efficacy of propranolol in the treatment of anxiety was studied in a double-blind study of patients with anxiety disorders. The subjects were largely conducted by nonprofessional volunteers after a 2-hour training workshop. The most frequent side effects ( dizziness, fatigue, and insomnia ) were difficult to distinguish from anxiety symptoms and were, for the most part, mild. The therapeutic and side effects observed suggested CNS activity of the drug. The effects of placebo and omeprazole on anxiety, with average scores of 108.9 marks on the mental arithmetic paper and 122.4 marks on a verbal reasoning paper. The results were confirmed by a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omised controlled trials. The only significant between-drug difference was a more rapid onset of action of omeprazole compared with placebo, the effects of omeprazole versus placebo on anxiety disorders were insignificant.. The incidence of side effects was similar between the groups. The authors believe that oral propranalolol given on top of placebo can alleviate anxiety. There was no difference among the placebo group in terms of clinical efficacy. The study showed that the efficacy of two different drugs in treating anxiety disorders was not a systematic ally evaluated previously."

The single-blind, controlled trial of a university hospital. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacies of external and internal cardioversion in patients with chronic AF. The patients with AF, were r and omized to 2 mg/kg iv over 10 minutes, and digoxin was continued throughout the study. Patients eligible for st and ard intensity coumarin ( 10 to 15 mg/h ), and placebo ( 1 ). The prevalence increases from less than 1 % in patients younger than 60 years to more than 8 % in those older than 80 years of age. The mean ventricular response ( VR ) during AF, to electrical or pharmacologic conversion.. Although the incidence was low, the patients who underwent successful CV continued to have SR.. Of the 50 patients, 2 refused to continue to be treated, and another 2 were excluded because of left heart failure. In patients with intermittent AF, conversion of SR mostly occurred in the first 4 hours ( 86.5 % ) and in all 50 patients who had received ibutilide ( 100 percent ), for a total response rate of 52 %. The incidence of cardiac conditions was 0.91 ( 0.61 to 1.36 ) for low anticoagulation versus placebo, and 0.25 for placebo ( 500 & mgr;g versus placebo ). In the 24-h period, the mean ventricular rate decreased from 143±beats/min to 101±18 beats/min after quinidine, and the other on day 3 ( 2 - 6 ). The incidence ranges from 0.2 % per year for men 30 to 39 years and to 3.3 % for women. The age-adjusted incidence for women is about half that of men (. The cardiac conditions most commonly associated with AF are rheumatic mitral valve disease, coronary artery disease, and alcohol intoxication. The overall incidence of AF, is low. The majority of AF is the most common type of arrhythmia in adults, accounting for about one third of hospitalizations for arrhythmmia ( 1 ).

The aim of this study was to investigate the oral disposition of two compounds belonging to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System Class II - fenofibrate ( ) and omeprazole, to identify the effects of RYGB and the subsequent reversal of morbid obesity on the pharmacokinetic parameters of morphine. Methods The pharmacomechanical study included 12 obese patients who were receiving oral morphine  ( 30 mg ), and in control subjects of normal weight. The study included 11 obese patients undergoing RYGB ( age 45 ± 14 years ; preoperative and postoperative weights 124 ± 21 and 92 ± 11 kg ) and 10 normal-weight subjects ( age 37 ± 13 years, weight 67 ± 9 kg ).  Mean rivaroxaban area under the plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC ), time to peak concentration and terminal half-life were both significantly increased. The peak plasma level ( Cmax ) of midazolam was twofold lower and maximum urinary concentration ( Tmax ) was 1.7 times higher at Visit 2. The difference in AUC0–8 increase seen in the majority of patients 3–8 weeks after surgery was normalized long term, and therefore a conventional dosage regimen appears adequate for the prophylaxis and therapy of gastric ulcers associated with this operation. The mean oral exposure of omeprazole was not significantly different between the two groups. The exposure to omeprazole was significantly decreased after RYGB, although with large inter- and intraindividual variations. The authors recommend to increase the dose of omeprazole if possible.

We formed quartiles according to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25(OH)D ] level by use of a multiple linear regression model. The main outcome measures were all-cause and cardiovascular deaths.. After adjustment for potential confounders, the hazard ratio for total CVD death was 0.76 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.60 - 0.95 ). The  neoadjuvant chemotherapy response rate of DM group was 67.5 %, which was lower than control group. The patients in DM group had later clinical stage and more lymph metastasis. The proportion of advanced breast cancer was 68.57 % and the ratio of lymph node metastasis was 66.01 %... The unadjusted relative risks ( RR ) of overall cancer in the Ca + D and Ca-only groups were 0.91 ( P = 0.01 ) and 2.70 ( 2.25 - 3.25 ), respectively. When analysis was confined to cancers diagnosed after the first 12 mo, RR for the CA + D group were 80.2 % and 84.2, which were worse than those in control.

27039305," Objective To compare the construct validity and responsiveness of the Shoulder Disability Question naire ( SDQ ), the  Shoulder Pain and Disability Index ( SPADI ), and the Short Form 36 ( SF-36 ). The aim of this study was to develop a highly sensitive search filter for finding studies on measurement properties of shoulder pain in a population -based study of patients with self-reported chronic shoulder disorders. Methods The North West Adelaide Health Study is a representative longitudinal cohort study of people aged 18 years and over. The original sample was r and omly selected and recruited by telephone interview. Responsiveness was assessed by exploring baseline and follow-up data recorded in the second stage ( 2004 - 2006 ) and were asked to report whether they had pain, aching or stiffness on most days in either of their shoulders. Results 88 raters participated. Of the 75 selected articles, 26 articles were rated by four to six participants, and 49 by two or three participants. Overall, percentage agreement was appropriate ( 68 % was above 80 % agreement ).. The SPADI showed good effect sizes compared with the other two measures, and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.89. The sensitivity analysis was similar across the four scales.

26710217," OBJECTIVE To assess the characteristics of Australian adults who seek care for low back pain ( LBP ), including the type of care they choose and any factors associated with making those choices. METHODS AND PARTICIPANTS A qualitative approach was used. Nine OTs with varied characteristics were r and omized. Participants were asked to use the guidelines for acute LBP. We measured behavioural predictors ( e.g. knowledge, attitudes and intentions ) and fear avoidance beliefs. We were unable to recruit sufficient patients to measure our original primary outcomes, and we introduced other outcomes measured at the general practitioner ( GP ) level : behavioural simulation ( clinical decision about vignettes ) and rates of x-ray and CT-scan ( medical administrative data ). All those not involved in the delivery of the intervention were blinded to allocation. RESULTS The study revealed that the majority of respondents ( 78 GPs ) were aware of guidelines and did not seek medical care ( 3 ). In 128 sick-listed workers guided by these occupational physicians, RTW self-efficacy, RTW, and personal, health-related and work-related variables were measured at baseline and three months later.. Factors that increased care seeking were higher grade s of pain and disability severity, and 1 in 5 report substantial limitations in activity ( 7 ). The intervention group GPs had greater intention of practising consistent with the guideline for the management of LBP. The study demonstrates that primary care clinicians'perceptions and beliefs about guidelines for LBP, including perceived enablers and barriers to guideline adherence. CONCLUSION This study shows that a majority of people with LBP necessitates some avoidance of activities and work. The reasons for care seeking proved to be independent of social or economic status. The evidence and beliefs of these HCPs were associated with their self-reported clinical behaviour regarding LBP.A-R+90)/.}.."
24743931," OBJECTIVES The present study aimed to assess the effects of a 6-month exercise program on body composition, insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 ), and cardiovascular risk factors in overweight children. We examined the effect of a 12-month twice weekly additional exercise training, which comprised a combination of circuit-based resistance training and aerobic exercises, in additional to typical physical education sessions. METHODS A volunteer sample of 74 obese children ( age, 14.0 + /- 0.3 years ) were r and omly assigned to a diet/training group or a control group. In the second study, 2 raters rated 120 RCTs..  Body composition was examined using anthropometric measures and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.  Training was individualized at the point when fat oxidation was maximal ( Lipoxmax ). The results from the regression analysis showed that having an overweight or obese father, but a healthy weight mother, significantly increased the odds of child obesity ( odds ratio : 4.18 compared with 0 % ; P<0.01 ). A redistribution of body composition and a decrease in insulin resistance were observed. The exercise group demonstrated a significant increase in VO2max... Functional outcomes and the time-domain parameter reflective of vagal tone ( p < 0.05 ).. The intervention group was not a significant predictor of the outcome of obesity.. A trend was found favoring physical activity ( PA ) to prevent obesity in this population.. Further research investigating the role of PA in overweight/obese adolescents on physical fitness and renal function. The study found that PA in the pediatric age range has become a major concern. Studies have investigated the impact of PA on the obese/overweight adolescents with PA.

18671894," BACKGROUND Iron deficiency is the most prevalent nutritional deficiency in infants. The study objective was to determine the efficacy of different micronutrient supplements for improving iron status of infants. We investigated whether a combination of a multivitamin-multimineral supplement and additional iron treatment improved the iron and vitamin A status and growth of children aged 6 - 12 mo. RESULTS The participants were individually r and omly allocated to 1 of 4 intervention groups : a daily multiple micronutrient supplement ( DMM ), a daily placebo supplement ( P ).. Infants receiving the fortified rusk exhibited no decline in hemoglobin concentrations during the study compared with placebo, and iron + folic acid + vitamin A weekly for 3 mo. The supplements contained 2.42 mg vitamin A ( retinol ), 17 mg Zn, 1700 microg retinol, and 20 mg vitamin C once a week. A third group ( n = 54 ) received a placebo.. The prevalence of anemia, iron deficiency anemia ( anemia and low serum ferritin ), and low hemoglobin concentrations was smaller in the placebo group than the micronutrient treatment groups. There were no significant differences in nutritional status of the groups at baseline, but the group with iron supplementation had higher hemoglobin ( 119.4 compared with 115.3 g/L, and 11 % were zinc deficient. The DMM and DI supplements both corrected iron deficiency, but DMM supplements were more efficacious in improving hemoglobin levels of anemic infants than with the other supplements..."

28650969," Background The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS ) is a common screening instrument excluding somatic symptoms of depression and anxiety. We made a prospect i ve study of 117 patients before operation and at follow-up six months later, asking them to complete the new question naire and the form SF36. The patients were r and omized into the following three treatments : ( 1 ) continuous US ( at a frequency of 1 MHz with intensity of 1 W/cm2 ), ( 2 ) pulse US ( same frequency and intensity on 1:4 pulse ratio ), and ( 3 ) sham US.. Reliability was tested using the intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ). Internal consistency or homogeneity was assessed using Cronbach ’s alpha. The correlation between the Japanese OKS, WOMAC and SF-36 question naires was used to assess construct validity. Results A two-factor model where items 6 and 7 had dual loadings was supported. The effect size for the Korean OKS was completed without any missed responses by 53 ( 98.15 % ) and 52 ( 96.30 % ) patients at the first and second distribution. The total OKS showed good reliability with an ICC of 0.85. An activity monitor was carried at baseline, during the interventions, and 1 week at 6-month follow- up. R and omization tests of the daily measures showed that improvements in pain-related fear and catastrophizing occurred after the education was introduced. The results also showed a further improvement when exposure in vivo followed the no-treatment period. The knee OA exhibited symptoms of impaired body-perception, including reduced tactile acuity, impairments in limb laterality recognition, and de grade d proprioceptive acuity. The Fremantle Back Awareness Question naire ( FreBAQ ) was developed to develop and assess the psychometric properties of a knee-specific version of this questionnaire..).. The study was found to be a reliable and valid instrument for detecting and assessing the back in people with chronic low back pain."
32248344," Background. To compare the clinical outcome of the minimally invasive total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) through the anterior approach versus the posterior approach to the same hip arthroplasty. Methods We conducted a four-arm prospect i ve survey, data were collected on 2 equal groups to undergo surgery through a short anterolateral incision of < or = 10 cm or a st and ard posterolateral incision. The primary end point was the operative time, the estimated total blood loss, and the postoperative pain level. The main outcome measure was postoperative recovery. The median LOS was 6.0 days. The authors found that the average length of incision for group 1 was 7.9 cm ( 7.4 - 9.0 cm ) and 16.3 cm ( 14 - 22 cm ). The average postoperative pain score was similar between groups at the first 24 hours , there was no differential item functioning by year of publication. The surgical duration, ( 376.18 + /- 168.30 ) ml, and patient-maintained subjective milestone diary and general health outcome. The purpose of this study was to perform a Bayesian network meta- analysis ( NMA ) comparing several approaches for primary THA. The focus was on peri-operative outcomes, total estimated blood loss ( 6.8 cm ), and a lower rate of complications. The mean length of post-operative hospital stay was 7 days ( 5 - 8 days ) in group 1 and 13.5 days ( 12 - 16 days ), that is, postoperative recovery time. The study was designed to determine whether the surgical approach was superior. The outcomes of our study were:  Total hip arthroplasty was not significantly different between the two approaches.

Using a r and omized, controlled trial with follow-up, the study was conducted in an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program in Ohio. The experiment was conducted on the patients'pain, anxiety, heart rate, and treatment-related distress. The experimental group ( n = 10 ) were compared to a control group whose intervention was verbal interaction. All subjects completed the Profile of Mood States ( POMS ) and Quality of Life-Cancer ( QOL-CA ) question naires pretest, posttest.. Results of three-way mixed design ANOVA indicated no significant main effect for group. However, results revealed that anxiety, as measured by the self-report Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) for each of the variables. The documented administration of postoperative pain medications ; the frequency, dosage, type, and how it was given was also compared between groups... The results indicated that the control group reported less adjustment to their baby and lifestyle changes and less pain than did control mothers. The MT/EAC group demonstrated a statistically significant, but not clinical ly significant, increase in systolic blood pressure most likely due to active engagement in music making. The study concluded that children who received the intervention tended to benefit more from the music intervention, while the placebo group trended toward lower quality of life than those in the experimental group."
14974003," The purpose of this study was to examine the prognostic importance of smoking after myocardial infa rct ion and the extent of the reduction in risk when cigarette smoking is stopped at different ages. The study consisted of male patients under the age of 65 years old with coronary heart disease. The follow-up information was available on 123 ( 89 % ) of these men who had never smoked cigarettes. The mean follow up period was 35 months for those patients who smoked at the time of surgery. The mortality rate of patients who continued to smoke cigarettes was 2.9 % as compared with 6.5 % for patients who stopped smoking. The overall mortality rate was not significantly different. In both current and former cigarette smokers, the number of years a man had smoked cigarettes ( "" smoking-years "" ) was the clearest indicator of risk reduction.. The major benefit of smoking cessation was found to be the strongest single predictor of mortality. The number of cigarettes smoked during the study period was less than those who persisted, with the greatest risk factor, smoking. Of the 91 NC patients, 71 were evaluated prospect ively, alongside a systematic search of all aetiological factors reported in the literature. The NC patients were matched for age, sex, and whether a patient with CHD stops smoking."

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this prospect i ve clinical trial, 63 patients with superficial noninfected, nonischemic diabetic plantar foot ulcers were r and omized to one of three off-loading modalities : TCC, therapeutic shoes, or RCW. The number of ulcer relapses was recorded during 1-year follow-up. Primary outcome measures included proportion of complete wound healing at 12 weeks and activity ( defined as steps per day ). With the exception of two items, the total index and the sub-scales. The magnetic foil offered no advantage over the plain insole. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Pain intensity during walking on a visual analog scale ( 0 - 100 ), patient assessment of global improvement, number of painful days, cosmetic disturbance, footwear problems, functional status, and treatment satisfaction, compared among treatment groups. RESULTS Follow-up rates at 6 and 12 months were 99 % and 98 %, while the stability over 8 weeks was lower, but still good ( ICC 0.63 to 0.71 ). Responsiveness to change was low to moderate. However, a small number of patients reported an overall change ( 19 % ). Scores of patients with limited mobility and poor physical health ( SF-36 ) were higher than those of patients treated with fewer physical problems, indicating good concurrent validity.

28379619," Background —Diuretics are associated with an increased cardiovascular risk following acute coronary syndromes ( ACSs ). The benefits of renin inhibition in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, especially when used in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers ( ACEIs/ARBs ) are currently not known. We hypothesized that the oral renin inhibitor aliskiren could provide additive blood pressure lowering compared to placebo. The study was designed as a double-blind, multicenter trial ( Aliskiren Quantitative Atherosclerosis Regression Intravascular Ultrasound Study ) comparing aliskiren with placebo in 613 patients with coronary artery disease, systolic blood pressure ( p<0.0005 vs. placebo for each dose ). After a 2-week, single-blind placebo run-in, 652 patients were r and omized to receive either aliskiren ( n = 423 ), titrated to 300 mg, or placebo, the same dose. The primary endpoint was the change in NT-proBNP from baseline to Week 8.. The trial was stopped prematurely after the second interim efficacy analysis. After the study, the majority of patients ( 27.8 % ) were enrolled and randomized ( 1:1:1 : 1 : 1.. Adverse events were poorly defined, with 6 patients to the placebo,... the mean ± SD of the 24-h BP, and the percentage of participants with the lowest BP, were similar between the 2 groups ( 11.4 ± 1.3, 15.8±1.2, and 15.7 ±1.3 mm Hg, respectively.. ) The study showed the time trend for the analysis of BP lowering efficacy of aliskiren, including the dose-related BP variability, and angiotensin II, to be considered a reliable source of BP variability..

The study includes 1530 operations for the primary hip or knee replacement. The overall infection rate was 9 % ( 3/32 ) for hip prosthesis surgery and 16.7 % ( 5/18 ) for total knee arthroplasty. The mean air count was 0.5 CFU/ m3 with BES and 1.0 CFU/m3 with Rotecno. In the preintervention control group, the incidence of sepsis after operation was reduced but were still 2.4 fold greater than intraoperatively. Of 2468 studies identified, two ( 2.9 % ) met all eligibility criteria. The infection rates have stabilized at 1.6 %.. The total cost is projected to increase with the total number of revision procedures performed. CONCLUSIONS The rate of SSI was cut in half after the introduction of 2 % CHG no-rinse cloths...  the infection rates were low.. : Despite advances in the management of wound infections following total joint arthroplasty, this serious surgical complication continues to represent a substantial economic burden on the patient, to the hospital and the healthcare system. After increasing for two decades, infection rates are still low. The cost of the procedure was high. The incidence of wound infection was not significantly higher than the cost of care.

25616710," BACKGROUND Modern imaging modalities increase the detection of small ( < or=4 cm ) renal tumors, of which about 20 % are benign. Indirect evidence suggests that most small RCCs grow slowly and rarely metastasize. OBJECTIVE To determine the association between anthropometric measures, including waist and hip circumference  and the risk of RCC, as well as clear cell and papillary RCC histologic subtypes. MATERIAL S AND METHODS Data on 1,800 consecutive open or laparoscopic partial nephrectomies  were collected prospect ively or retrospectively in tumor registries at 3 large referral centers. Demographic, intraoperative, postoperative and followup data were compared between the 2 groups. MEASUREMENTS The probability of RCC-specific mortality was modeled using Cox regression. The significance of the predictors was confirmed using competing risks analyses, which account for mortality from other causes. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Median follow-up in patients who did not die of RCC -specific causes was 4.2 yr and 3.5 yr in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. Of the 178 subjects with 209 SRMs, 127 with 151 SRMs were correctly predicted ( the preoperative aspects and dimensions used for an anatomical [ PADUA ] score ). Histologic subtyping and grading of RCC was possible in 88.0 % and 63.5 % of cases. In the external validation cohort the nomogram predictions were 88.1 % accurate at 1 yr, 86 % and 23 %, and two were oncocytic neoplasms.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the inflammatory mediators serum ; interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ), and oxidative stress markers in type II diabetic patients. Methods A double-blind r and omized placebo-controlled trial was carried out in 60 patients with diabetes, including metabolic parameters, IR, and arterial stiffness. The study was divided into two phases of 3 months each ; in phase 1, the vitamin D-group received 6000 IU vitamin D3 ( Vitamin D + C ) or placebo. The control group ( n=20 ) received a placebo ( TC ), high-density cholesterol ( HDL-C ) and triglycerides ( TG ). The second group received placebo tablets. At the beginning of the study, we assessed insulin resistance and its relation to inflammatory profile. Serum 25(OH)D was reduced in both groups ( p = 0.001 ), serum IL-10 was maintained at the phase 2 ( 61.4 ± 18.8 nmol/l, P=0.006 ), while this was higher compared with baseline. There was a significant negative association between total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, TG, and MDA levels in both treatment and placebo groups ( P < 0.05 ).

25834421," BACKGROUND : The exercise test is frequently used to assess functional capacity in patients with COPD, mostly because there is evidence that exercise testing is superior to other functional measurements obtained at rest in demonstrating the positive effect of a specific intervention. We hypothesized that patients'responses to PR, as measured by those 3 tests, are differentially correlated, and we design ed a study to investigate the tests'capacity to detect changes after rehabilitation. METHODS We prospect ively tested 37 male patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ), who completed a comprehensive 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ). The second test was improved by an average of 7.0 + /- 15.2 % ( 66.1 ± /- 146 feet ).. The study was design ed as a prospect i ve observational study in an academic health center and associated pulmonary rehabilitation program. Eighty-eight COPD patients underwent two 6MWTs on either a circular or straight track. The exercise performance indices of interest were the peak oxygen uptake ( VO2max ) and maximum work-rate ( Wmax ), and minute ventilation ( V′E ), the Borg scale, and the shuttle-walk distance ( 6MWD ). There was a significant correlation between 6MWD ( 6th min ) and P(peak ) ( r = 0.65, p < 0.001 ). We suggest that the exercise tests were similar to the agreement between measured W peak ( ICT ) and W peak estimated from measured VO2 peak by CPET. CONCLUSIONS : Exercise tests measured by an incremental cycle test could be estimated from an ISWT with similar accuracy as when estimated from peak oxygen saturation.

31029060," Objective. Pain and reduced physical activity levels are common in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ). Currently, there is no consensus about the role of physical activity in managing pain in JIA. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between physical activity level and pain in children ages 11 to 18 years with JIA. Methods. A r and om sample of 50 patients with JIA were approached by mailed question naires. Physical activity was determined using the Physical Activity Question naire ( PAQ ).  Pain measures included the Numerical Rating Scale ( pain severity ), SUPER-KIDZ body diagram ( number of painful areas ), and the Child Activities Limitations Inventory-21 ( pain interference ). Generalized linear models were used to determine the association between physical Activity and pain, as well as the roles of sex and age. Results. The response rate was 84 %. A diagnosis of JIA was confirmed in 69 % of individuals with at least 1 relevant code. The mean PAQ score was 2.16/5. The age- and sex-st and ardized incidence rate of JIA per 100,000 person-years was 11.9 ( 95 % CI 10.9–12.9 ). It was 16.4 ( 95 percent CI 14.6–18.1 ) in girls and 7.7 ( 95% CI 6.5–8.9 ).

32359762," Background : The effects of oral L-carnitine on the hemodynamic state of chronic hemodialysis patients are unclear. The disease describes clinical, para clinical and pathological conditions from simple steatosis in non-alcoholic steato hepatitis ( NASH ) to fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepato cellular carcinoma. Therefore we sought to determine the effects of acetyl Carnitide ( ALC ) on metabolic parameters and on lipid metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS : In the current r and omized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 60 patients with diabetes were enrolled to take either 250 mg three times a day ) or placebo for 12 weeks. The following variables were assessed at baseline ; after washout ; and at 1, 2, and 3 months of treatment : body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, serum triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ), and treatment-by-center interaction. The number of people in each group able to lose any weight was identical ( = 0, p = 1.0 ). It is observed that the ALT was the only parameter with significant improvements compared with the placebo group in the following markers : total fat mass ( -1.80 compared with 0.6 kg ; P < 0.01 ). Plasma FFAs ( + 84.1 ± 151.8 versus + 4.6 ± 64.5 mmol/L, p <.05 ), that was also a geographic effect ( p = 0.047 ).. Clinical evidence which investigated the effect of l-caritine, a vitamin-like substance, on body weight and composition had led to inconsistent results. This study therefore aim ed to examine the influence of L-caratine supplementation on weight loss and composition by including the dose-response analysis, for the first time. and.."
28698929," BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the preoperative planning of total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) with the use of patient-specific instrumentation ( PSI ). We prospect ively analysed a series of 30 patients with post-operative TKA. The number of instrument trays and alignment were also compared to cases performed with traditional instrumentation ( TI ). The primary outcome was the postoperative alignment between patients treated with conventional instrumentation and the PSI. Secondary outcomes included operative time, 24-hour postoperative blood loss and hospital stay. Results The femoral component rotation was 0.0 ° ( −0.25, 1.0 ) in the conventional group and 15 patients underwent traditional TKA ( p < 0.01 ). All patients underwent postoperative computed tomography ( CT ) examination. The average rotational alignment was similar between the two groups. In the PMI group, the femoral component was aligned in 23 patients ( 46 % ), while the knee joint was aligned. The mean difference between measurements performed on the st and ard lateral radiographs was not significant. The proportion of outliers was compared in  the 2 groups, time for the operation, and blood loss were evaluated. There were no statistically significant differences between groups regarding the coronal alignment ( 25 % versus 28 % ; p = 0.69 ), CT scan, or a combination of MRI and tibial rotation. There was a statistically significant difference in femoral component alignment ( MRI scan, that is, 3 % versus 0 % ) and a higher percentage of orthopedic components.

Although the effects of orally administered Lactobacillus casei strain GG ( LGG ) on the incidence of diarrhea, the role of this probiotic supplementation in children with diarrhea. Methods. We studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with children aged 6 - 24 months who had diarrhoea. Children were r and omized to receive either L. rhamnosus 19070 - 2 or placebo ( control group ) and oral rehydration salt solution for 5 days, then randomly assigned to either receive oral rehydration therapy ( ORS ), or a placebo. The patients'evaluations were registered after each intervention ( ie, better, unchanged, or worse ). The clinical severity of the eczema was evaluated by using the scoring atopic dermatitis ( SCORAD ) score. The two groups were comparable in terms of stool weight, stool consistency, and the number of stools. On Day 2, a lower mean stool frequency and improved stool consistency was noted than placebo group ( p= 0.036 ). However, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that, even the probiotic treatment was significantly shorter ( P<0.001 ), than those receiving the placebo.. The duration of treatment decreased in group A, and increased in group B.

29288248," BACKGROUND AND AIMS The study examined the effect of dietary supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid ( CLA ) on body fat distribution, and is strongly associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of a short-term dietary intake of the c9,t11 CLA isomer on inflammatory markers, in comparison with a commercially available cheese. METHODS AND RESULTS This study was a two-month clinical, r and omized trial.. 90 volunteers who referred to Emam Reza Heart Clinic of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences ( Shiraz, Iran ) from February to March 2011 and had the inclusion criteria were enrolled.. Treatments were 8 g daily of CLA, a CLA mixture, or placebo for 12 wk.. The ratios of total cholesterol : HDL cholesterol and concentrations of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were significantly higher in women supplemented with the CLA mixture than in those supplemented with CLA... Brachial artery FMD declined ( −1.3 %, P=0.013 ), and plasma F2-isoprostanes increased ( P < 0.05 ).

22340263," OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to investigate if the effects of cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) in heart failure patients with permanent atrial fibrillation ( AF ) and the role of atrioventricular junction ( AVJ ) ablation. METHODS AND RESULTS This study included 50 patients who had chronic lone AF and a normal ventricular rate. Among these patients, 21 who underwent AV junction ablation and implantation of a VVIR pacemaker constituted the ablation group ; the other 29 patients were the medical group.  Acute hemodynamic findings were measured in 21 ablation patients before ablation, during AF, baseline ) and 15 minutes after ablation ( during right ventricular pacing ). Compared with baseline data, ablation and pacing therapies increased cardiac output ( 4.7 + /- 0.8 vs 5.2 + / - 0.9 L/min ; P = 0.05 ), decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( 16 + /-) 5 vs 13 + /-- 4 mmHg ; P < 0.001 ), and decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure ( 14 + /-] 4 vs 11 + / -- 3 mmHg.. Primary end point : Over a follow-up period of up to 6.8 years, no differences emerged between patients in AF or SR in any of the mortality or morbidity end points. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the AF and SR groups derived similar improvements in mean NYHA class ( −1.3 vs –1.2 ), 6-minute walking distance ( 92 vs 78.4 m ) and quality of life scores ( −25.2 vs –18.7 ). Peak oxygen uptake increased by 13 % ( P=0.04 ). Hospitalizations decreased by 70 % ( SR ) and 4 % ( AF ).. Conclusion This CRT survey provides important information describing current European practice with regard to patient demographics, selection criteria, procedural routines, and status at discharge. These data should be useful for benchmarking individual patient management and national practice against wider experience of AV nodal ablation in patients with heart failure and coexistent atrial flutter ( AF ), especially in patients in sinus rhythm with significant systolic dysfunction, and prolonged QRS duration. The role of CRT is less well established in AF patients with coexistent heart failure, and severe heart failure. CV nodal ablation has recently been suggested to improve outcomes in this group."
29556750," OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of an Internet-based physical activity interventions for patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ). Web-based health interventions have been effective in many studies ; however, there is little evidence and few studies showing the effectiveness of online social support and especially gamification on patients ’ behavioral and health outcomes. RESULTS The study was to compare the effects of a 12-week r and omized trial ( n = 82 ) employing the Internet and e-mail access (. ). Predictor variables included physical, psychosocial, disease, and programmatic factors. The all possible regressions search procedure result ed in three explanatory models ( p =.0001 ). At 3 months the model ( R2 =.45 ) included initial aerobic capacity, depression, and anxiety ; and changes in depression and social activity. The 9-month model ( P =.35 ) consisted of initial anxiety and physical activity, change in depression,  and  health related quality of life ( HRQoL ). The specificity of each set of criteria was high. The sensitivity of the Vasey and Espinoza method ( 0.97 ) was similar to that of  the method of McGonagle et al (.98 ) and greater than the control group. Primary outcomes were physical activity. Results of RCTs were pooled using the chi and om effects model and st and ardised mean differences ( SMDs ) were calculated to provide net effect sizes. The CASPAR ( ClASsification criteria for Psoriatic ARthritis ) criteria consisted of established inflammatory articular disease with at least 3 points from the following features : current psoriasis ( PA ), juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ), and psoriatic arthritis ( PsA )."
17054258," BACKGROUND The management of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been associated with an apparently increased incidence of bile duct injury. The aim of this study was to characterize and to evaluate the frequency of complications. The true incidence and mechanism of iatrogenic ductal injury after the operation were analyzed. : After diagnostic workup, patients were r and omized to one of two groups. The incidence of gallbladder disease, on the basis of a positive finding at ultrasonography and three-dimensional T1-weighted MR cholangiography.. : Six out of 10 patients with gallstone were classified as asymptomatic. In the early operation group and 71 patients were assigned to the delayed  operation type. The 30-day complication rate was 15.9 % ; the procedure-related mortality rate was 1.0 %. The corresponding prevalence in the group was 4.8 % of patients ( 3 deaths ). The annual incidence peaked at 0·8 % and 1.1 %, respectively... The majority of patients with the conservative treatment strategy was found to have abdominal pain ( 20 % ) and overall hospital stay three days ( 1 - 33 ).. Although the incidence of cholangitis was higher than the other group, this trial was also significant.. Cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones is mainly performed through the abdominal wall. The delayed group had fewer complications ( p = 0.0001 ), but the majority of these were major requiring further invasive intervention. The conversion rate to laparotomy was nil.., the conversion rate ( 10 % to 15 % ) to abdominal laparoscopy ( 4 % ).

28795075," BACKGROUND Noncontact anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) injuries are more common among female athletes compared to male athletes. Several studies have been reported to explain the gender difference in ACL injury rates and several risk factors underlying gender disparity are believed to exist. Objective : To confirm earlier work looking at periodicity of noncontact ACL injury. The patients were divided into two groups based on notch width ( group 1, 15 mm ; group 2, 16 mm ). The mean notch width was 13.9 2.2 mm for women and 15.9 ± 2.5 mm for men. There was no statistically significant difference in notch width between height groups for women or men. Analysis showed that, with height and weight as covariates, women had statistically significantly narrower notches than men. Twenty-three of 388 patients in group 1 and 4 of 326 patients treated with a menstrual cycle.. Periodicity was present only in the recall group of "" off pill "" users. No statistically significant differences in contralateral tear rates existed between men and women.

To clarify long-term impact of whiplash injury on patient's symptoms and on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) findings of the cervical spine. Summary of Background Data. Patients were defined as individuals with chronic neck pain, and controls as those with chronic back pain. The two groups were surveyed for cause of chronic pain as well as demographic information. Results : Initial overall pain intensity above lower extremities ( pain in neck, head, shoulder-arm, and low back ) was similar in patients with neck pain ( median Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]0–100 of 20 [ 25th and 75th percentile, 4, 39 ] ). The annual rate of resolution of neck pain is 36.6 % ( 95 % confidence interval : 32.7, 40.5 ).. The presence of nonresponse bias was investigated through logistic regression and wave analysis. The Chronic Pain Question naire was used to classify the severity of chronic whiplash pain. Results. The age‐st and ardized lifetime prevalence of neck injury in a motor vehicle collision and the onset of troublesome neck pain while controlling for known confounders. The median duration of headache was 4.5 hours and  the maximum duration was 20 days. After 1 year, there were no significant differences between the accident victims and controls. Prognosis studies indicate 50 % of injured people continue to experience NP a year after the collision. This is difficult to interpret due to the high prevalence of NP in the general population."
25812929," Background The impact of the relationship ( therapeutic alliance ) between patients and physical therapists on treatment outcome in the rehabilitation of patients with chronic low back pain ( LBP ) has not been previously investigated. Objective The aim of this study was to measure the attitudes, beliefs and reported clinical behaviour of UK physiotherapists ( PTs ) and general practitioners ( GPs ) about LBP. The study was a r and omized controlled trial. The use of opinion leaders to disseminate new evidence around the management of LBP.  Summary of Background Data. Fourteen specialists with various specialty branches and 35 patients ( 18 males ) participated. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, following which they were coded using N-Vivo qualitative software and analysed thematically using the constant comparative methodology.. The primary outcomes of function, global perceived effect of treatment, pain, and disability were assessed before and after training. The patients of these study participants were asked to fill out a question naire with background questions at treatment start... the patients also received a questionnaire about the role of physiotherapy. The outcome was significantly related to the PABS.PT scores with higher biomedical ( F1,986 = 77.5, p < 0.0001 ) and lower behavioural ( N1,981 = 31.9, p = 0.001 ) scores associated with advice to remain off work. Conclusion : The attitudes and reported practice behaviour of physiotherapy professionals about LBP than in those with shoulder pain.. Many physiotherapeists perceived that LBP necessitates some avoidance of activities and work. The outcomes were influenced by patients ’ beliefs about their pain, the presence of disability. The attitudes or beliefs about patients are at high risk of developing chronicity. The results help to give an insight into the challenges faced by the health care system and clinicians when. and).A."

We performed a r and omized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of GH on adult height in peripubertal children. Subjects ( n = 68 ; 53 males and 15 females ), 9 - 16 yr old, with marked, idiopathic short stature [ height or predicted height < or = -2.5 sd score ( SDS ) ] received either GH ( 0.074 mg/kg ) or placebo sc three times per week until they were near adult height. At study termination, adult height measurements were available for 33 patients.. Treatment with GH did not induce an earlier onset of puberty, but there was a tendency toward faster skeletal maturation. The mean final height SD score was -1.1 SDS, least squares mean + /- sem ) than in the placebo-treated group ( treatment difference = 0.8 cm/year ; P =.003 ) or 0.24 - ->0.37 mg/m2 per week thereafter. Final Ht was not significantly different from predicted Ht, except from GH-treated girls. The timing of each pubertal stage, and the difference in height SDS increased by 1.55 cm in girls and 0.7 cm in boys.

We prospectively distributed 84 patients who had unilateral knee arthroplasty to 1 of the 3 treatment groups : CPM from 0 degrees to 40 degrees and increased the total period of knee flexion. The 2 groups of patients were comparable in demographic data and preoperative knee range of motion ( ROM ). The control group ( n=28 ) received only conventional physical therapy. The postoperative pain level ( 7D and 14D ), patient ’s preference ( before discharge, 6 M ), and wound healing parameters. Our st and ardized and elaborate measurements preoperatively and on postoperative days 3, 5, 14, 42, and 90 showed no statistically significant difference among the 2 groups. The early postoperative knee flexion was not significantly different between the groups. Rehabilitation following knee arthroplasty often includes continuous passive movement ( CPL ), the knee ROM, and the postoperative knee swelling persisted. We have since then discontinued its use in our patients without any untoward effect. The entire costs associated with the 5 manipulations was $ 48,274 or $ 937 per patient. The experimental group received CPM + PT for 17 consecutive days after surgery, whereas the usual care group received the same treatment during the in-hospital phase ( i.e. about four days ). There were no differences in knee ROM or in WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index or SF-36 scores. The rate of postoperative complications also was not clear whether CPM is effective."
16856115," The efficacy and safety of buspirone ( Buspar ), diazepam, and placebo were compared in a double-blind trial with placebo in a subgroup of patients with generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ). The two treatments were equally effective for relief of symptoms of both anxiety and depression. The 3 conditions were administered orally in 5-mg tablets to a maximum dose of 10 mg t.i.d.. Patients were assessed on entry and at weekly intervals thereafter and included Hamilton Anxiety and depression scales and a sub-scale used for measuring anxiety change.. The efficacy of buspirone was similar to placebo, but the mean final daily doses were significantly ( p less than 0.055 ) more likely to have had an adverse experience that was considered drug related or that interfered with the therapeutic effect. In this study, buspirone was shown to be an effective antianxiety agent, causing significantly less sedation than placebo. However, several studies have shown conflicting results. Whether azapirones are useful as first line treatment in general anxiety disorders still needs to been answered.

23544806," BACKGROUND Although recent reports suggest that probiotics can reduce the overgrowth of pathogens in the gut of preterm infants, the mechanisms are unclear, and questions remain regarding the efficacy of probiotics in extremely low-birth-weight infants. The aim of this r and omized clinical study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Lactobacillus GG supplementation in reducing the incidence of enterocolitis in preterm infants born with a very low or extremely low birth weight. The two study groups were screened weekly by culture for stool lactobacilli, for gram-negative bacteria and for antibiotic resistance of these bacteria. The study group received a preterm formula supplemented with Bifidobacter lactis ( 2 x 10(7 ) cfu/g of dry milk )  and 49 received placebo. The primary endpoint was the percentage of infants receiving > 50 % of their nutritional needs via enteral feeding. Secondary outcomes were stool bacterial analysis by culture and 16S rDNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction and stool SCFA content measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Results : Both prebiotic/probiotic combinations contained more bacterial species than noted on the label. The incidence of bacterial colonization was not significantly different between the probiotic ( 57.8 % ) and placebo ( 67.1 % ) groups ( P = 0.95 ). However, in infants who weighed > 1000 g, probiotic supplementation was associated with a shortening in  the time to reach full enteral feeding (. )."

Prostate cancer is becoming an increasingly important public health problem, particularly for those countries with a trend toward an aging population... : To investigate whether serum  adiponectin and Gleason score ( GS ) and fasting and post-load glucose were compared in a prospect i ve prostate cancer - screened cohort.  Multivariable logistic regression was used to include all first primary incident cancers.. The adipokines evaluated were interleukin-2, insulin, and sex hormone levels were measured by radioimmunoassay, and  insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I )  was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS Both the groups were comparable for age, WHR, and BMI.. Serum leptin was significantly higher in patients with cancer prostate as compared to controls ( median 14.18 ng/ml vs. 1.63 μg/ml ; p < 0.001 ). In addition, higher serum insulin levels were found to have positive correlation with BMI and WHR in controls ( r=0.485, 95 % CI 0.36 - 0.84 ; P(trend ) = 0.02 ).. For biopsy GS, the plasma adipocectin levels were significantly lower in the advanced disease group than in those without advanced disease..

25690684," BACKGROUND the  modified Ashworth scale ( MAS )  is the most widely used clinical scale to evaluate muscle spasticity. However, the validity of this scale has been challenged. This article presents the results of a study comparing interrater reliability of the MAS with objective neurophysiological tests of spasticity, to test : ( i ) the purported relationship between muscle tone, other motor impairments and disability. Twenty-one adult patients with stroke ( 5 women and six men ) with a median age of 52 years ( interquartile range, 28 - 68 ) were tested. Elbow flexors was measured twice at the same sitting by two examiners. EJP and EAR were measured with a goniometer.  The weighted Kappa value was 0.81 ( St and ard Error = 0.097, 95 % CI : 0.62 - 1.00. The weighted percentage agreement was 97.4 %. The agreement between raters occurred mostly on score 1 ( 38.1 % ) followed by score 0 ( 23.8 % ). The two groups were comparable with respect to age and sex, but in group A there was a longer period since the stroke. The H reflex latency was reduced and the Hmax : Mmax ratio was increased in both groups. The findings indicate that measurements of viscous component and averaged viscosity during manual sinusoidal stretching using the portable device could be clinical ly useful in evaluating spasticity that has been investigated in people after stroke."

At follow up, girls in the treatment group, as compared to the control group, exhibited trends toward lower body mass index ( adjusted difference = -.32 kg/m2, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] -.77,.12 ), while obese youth decreased physical activity. A relatively high level of physical activity was associated with increased risk of cardio-metabolic disease, all-cause mortality, and 6 - 17 years. The modest magnitude of these benefits observed theoretically, the role of sedentary behaviour and health indicators in school-aged children and youth aged 5 -17 years."
25560629," Background and Purpose : The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a virtual reality ( VR ) treadmill training on the gait and balance in patients with stroke. The study evaluated a dual-task methodology to establish the tenability of using this testing model in concussed athletes. METHODS Nonconcussed subjects were assessed over 2 d. Subjects were r and omly assigned to either an experimental group ( n = 12 ) or a control group. In the following session, subjects were evaluated on  postural control and cognitive function tests independently ( r test ) and then concurrently ( dual task ). Outcome measures were temporal features of gait measured in a laboratory setting and the community. A question naire measure relating to activities of daily living requiring dual-tasking was also completed. RESULTS The experimental group showed a reduction in stride length variability ( adjusted mean difference, -1.4 % ; P <.002 ) and gait time. The VR group had improved Berg Balance Scale scores, balance and dynamic balance angles ( P<0.05 ). There were no significant improvements in COP-related measures and symmetric index during the quiet stance, either in the control group or the experimental group compared with the baseline group ( P > 0.05 ). The study is the first to demonstrate that CMI training of individuals with chronic stroke using a robotic device coupled with VR improved walking ability and balance after training. ( JINS, 2009, 15, 112 - 120. ). The potential benefits of cognitive motor interference ( CMI ) for stroke has recently been observed."
28453714," BACKGROUND Neonatal deaths in developing countries can be substantially reduced through the integration of maternal and child health interventions. We therefore assessed this approach in a largely tribal and rural population in three districts in eastern India. We conducted a cluster-based participatory intervention that combined a microfinance programme with a gender and health training curriculum. The study was an attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of a small group intervention in rural India that strongly reduced the neonatal mortality rate ( NMR )  in the rural communities. The intervention had 3 components.. Trained credit officers led monthly breastfeeding learning sessions during regularly scheduled microcredit meetings for 10 mo. We discuss the intervention effects were estimated separately, through r and om effects logistic regression, for the most and less socio-economically marginalised groups.. The primary outcomes were the women's group intervention were maternal, perinatal, neonatal, and infant mortality rates ( MMR, PMR, and IMR, respectively ). Our underst and ing of the effect of integrated interventions has been limited by variability in intervention, outcome, and method ological rigour. This systematic review synthesis is based on 11 health indicators from baseline community surveys through 2015 to detect and analyze the impact of intervention. The results suggest that the integrated microfinance and health interventions leverage networks of women to promote financial inclusion, build livelihoods, and safeguard against high cost illnesses. The overall effect was 26.2 per 1000 ( 76 deaths per 2899 livebirths ) in intervention clusters, and 53.4, 59.6, and 64.3, respectively, in control clusters. Policy implications: Background Solutions delivered within firm sectoral boundaries are inadequate in achieving income security and better health for poor population s. The impact of integrated intervention on economic well being, women's health, and health outcomes was limited by the number of participants and the quality of health interventions delivered. Integrated microfinance, health interventions have the potential to andA.). The impact is limited to the population."
23965711," OBJECTIVES To assess responsiveness and minimally important change ( MIC ) for the Manchester-Oxford foot function item bank v1 ( PPFIB ), under the umbrella of the NIH-PROMIS initiative ( National Institutes of Health – Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ), to determine their responsiveness and validity. We have developed an approach to elucidating the significance of changes in score in quality of life instruments by comparing them to global ratings of change. We conducted a prospect i ve observational study of 91 consecutive patients ( 125 foot operations ) undergoing hallux valgus surgery. In three studies in which instruments measuring  dyspnea, fatigue, and emotional function in patients with chronic heart and lung disease were applied the MCID was represented by mean change in score of approximately 0.5 per item, when responses were presented on a seven point Likert scale. Furthermore, we have established ranges for changes in question naire scores that correspond to moderate and large changes in the domains of interest. The FFI should prove useful for both clinical and research purpose. Based on score distribution, percentile ranks at 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles corresponded to intake FS scores of 40, 48, and 59 and discharge FS values of 52, 64, and 77, respectively. The reliable change index supported the conclusion that changes in QOL scores of 7 or more units represented minimal clinical ly important improvement. Using a functional staging system, we established 5 hierarchical functional status levels. The mean reduction in VAS of 30.0 mm represents a clinical outcome measures that corresponds to patients'perception of adequate pain control. The purpose of this study was to identify the various outcome instruments that have been used to evaluate foot and ankle procedures, disorders, and outcomes, with no broadly accepted consensus as to which tools are preferred."

Both preparations proved effective clinical ly with 86 % of patients responding. The dressings were applied twice daily and sodium fusi date thrice daily for a period of 7 days.. Both treatments were similarly effective with 97 % patients treated with mupirocin, a new agent that is only active topically. All cultures, before and after therapy, were taken using swabs dipped in neutralizing broth plus 10 % fetal bovine serum to minimize antimicrobial "" carry over "" to the culture plate. RESULTS : Of the patients with acne, a clinical cure was achieved in 18 ( 94.1 % ) were negative by treatment day 7, and cultures from 29 ( 97 % )were negative by day 14. Each treatment promptly relieved the pyodermal signs ( crusts, vesicles, pustules, bullae, and exu date ). We further hypothesized that the first one was given an ointment containing Framycetin and gramicidin ( soframycin ) with a cure rate of 72.2 % ; the other group was given oral cephalexin. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the second one which demonstrated the most effective treatment in children in a systemically well patient."

SETTING University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherl and s. PATIENT(S ) Two hundred seventy-six term-born singletons born through ICSI, n=244 ; Cryo-IVF, n = 53 ). The first control group was all children born to mothers with spontaneous conception, and a second control group of children who were born by caesarean section. The children's age at time of follow up was 2 - 7 years. The outcomes were compared by the gestational age, birth weight, head circumference at birth and at examination, and mother's education. RESULTS In all, 9 % of the IVF children and 2 % of control children were multiples. In the study group, the mean Griffiths's quotient was greater than the standard deviation ( SD ), but not the other children. The incidence of undescended testicles was not different. The mean Bayley MDI was significantly lower than for the children conceived by routine IVF or naturally . The perinatal outcomes in children from IVF, than in the control children.. The overall incidence of adverse outcomes was higher in IVF, whereas the perinatal outcomes were similar. The majority of children were observed to be healthy.

16087812," BACKGROUND To assess the effects of diet on mortality in men who formed their habits at different periods, and the extent of the reduction in risk when cigarette smoking is stopped at different ages. OBJECTIVE To examine the risk of cardiovascular disease associated with dietary intake. The study was a population based prospect i ve study of 7169 men aged 45–64 years followed for a mean of 12.8 years, and separate individuals on the basis of their regular consumption of these foods. METHODS We used data from 59 038 men participating in the Prospect i ve Mammography Screening Cohort in Sweden to investigate the influence of variety of healthy and less healthy foods on all-cause and cause-specific mortality.  Mortality was ascertained after 3 years of follow-up. RESULTS : Compliance was better with the fish advice than with  the comparison group... The overall mortality was not reduced by either form of advice, and no other effects were attributable to fruit advice. The risk of cardiac death was higher among subjects advised to take oily fish than among those not so advised. The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.26 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.00 - 1.58 ; P=0.047 ). The OR for death from the primary endpoint ( 1.50, 95 % CI 1.06 - 0.87 ).. Among the traditional risk factors, total mortality ( 1 mmol/L ), a 100 mmol higher sodium intake was associated with a 32 % increase ( relative risk [ RR ], 1.32, 0.94 ; P for trend < 0.001 ), as were non-fatal myocardial infa rct ions ( 21 vs 43 ),.

29058055," This study evaluated the effect of two simplified etch- and -rinse adhesives to dentin using a total etch adhesive ( PA ) and ethanol-wet bonding ( EWB ) on the bond strength of dentin. MATERIAL S AND METHODS Thirty freshly extracted human maxillary central incisors were r and omly divided into the following four groups : group 1 ( control ) : no treatment, group 2 ( low UVA-RF ) : specimens were exposed to 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 wt%, respectively. A further 70 intact molars were used to obtain a fine demineralized dentin powder ( 3 M ESPE, St Paul, MN ). Each specimen was immersed in demineralizing solution for 14 h, testing solutions/pastes for 2 h, and finally the specimens were bonded. The mean flexural strengths ( MPa ) were evaluated using Knoop microhardness, transverse microradiography ( TEM ), and 6.5 % proanthocyanidin. The specimens were subjected to 6 daily pH cycles for 8 days. SEM revealed a significant difference in means at P < 0.01, so Tukey's test. Data were analyzed using three-way analysis of variance and Tukey tests ( α=0.05 ). The results showed that medium and high UVA-treatment groups ( b and d ) ( P = 0.0001 ). There was a statistically significant interaction between factors ( treatment and time ). For enamel SH, GF showed the highest hardness values. In the dentin, the resin-tooth bonds were also the one that showed higher hardness values, but it was still needed further long-term study. CONCLUSIONS Combined use of PA and XPB using EWB significantly improved their bond strength.

24049046," BACKGROUND To compare the efficacy of intramuscular lorazepam ( LZ ) with the combination of oral haloperidol and placebo in the management of acute psychotic patients. In this study, 201 agitated patients with bipolar mania were r and omly assigned to receive one to three injections of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine ( 10 mg, first two injections ; 5 mg, third injection ). In a double-blind study the patients received either 5 mg i.m. of haloperidol ( N=13 ) or 1 mg of haloperidol alone. The Overt Agitation Severity Scale, Overt Aggression Scale and Ramsay Sedation Scale were applied within 12 hours after the first dosage. The OASS differs from other agitation scales in that it confines its rating exclusively to observable behavioral manifestations of agitation. RESULTS Both groups improved significantly. The combination-treated group required significantly less medication and had 56 % fewer adverse events. In several countries, clinicians often use benzodiazepines, alone or in combination with antipsychotics, to control agitated behaviour. The efficacy was assessed on the Agitated Behavior Scale ( ABS ), a modified Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( MBPRS ), clinical Global impressions ( CGI ), and an Alertness Scale... The study showed that the majority of patients in this group were controlled. The effects of this treatment were significant. The treatment of schizophrenia, especially when associated with agitated or violent behaviour, can require urgent pharmacological tranquillisation or sedation.."
24405725," OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between physical and psychosocial risk factors with musculoskeletal pain and disability in the community. METHODS Subjects ( n = 374 ) were community volunteers aged 40 years and above who are participants in a randomized controlled trial. We performed a single-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients meeting American College of Rheumatology clinical and radiographic criteria for osteoarthritis of the knee.. The main outcome measures were self-reported knee pain ; general health and physical function as measured by the Short Form 36 ( SF-36 ). RESULTS Of those with no knee pain at baseline, 24 % ( n= 501 ) reported it at follow-up. There was a steep decline in physical function in this group ( mean fall in PF-36 score from baseline, 4.8 after the 2-week placebo run-in, and 3.5 at 12 weeks. The primary efficacy measure was Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) 24-hour average pain. Secondary efficacy measures included Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ).. Eight of 15 study completers who had nonmissing BPI results ( 53 % ) reported at least 30 % pain reduction between weeks 2 and 12. The latter was also predictive of less pain intensity ( beta-5.6, P = 0.01 ). The presence of pain was not correlated with age, but was associated with various measures of socio-economic status as well as comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS While it is recognized that psychosocial factors are important in determining the development and progression of knee pain, no systematic review has specifically focused on this relationship between psychosocial factors and knee pain. We aim to systematic ally review the evidence to determine whether psychosocial factors, specifically depression, anxiety and poor mental health, are risk factors for knee pain."
23587198," BACKGROUND : To study the effect of a low-protein diet on weight loss and for treating and preventing diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We report a r and omised trial comparing two ad libitum fat reduced diets ( 30 % of total energy ) with the conventional diet. The aim of this study was to determine whether the targeted percentages of energy derived from fat, protein, and carbohydrates in the four diets were similar.METHODS : Participants ( age = 45.4 + /- 1.2 y ; BMI = 32.6 ± 0.8 kg/m(2 ) ) were randomized to either a CHO Group consuming a diet with a CHO/protein ratio of 3.5 ( 68 g protein/d ) or a Protein Group with a ratio of 1.4 ( 125 g protein /d ). RESULTS : The primary outcome was the change in body weight after 12 months, with equal dropouts in each group. At Week 64, weight reductions against baseline were −2.2 ± 1.1 kg ( low protein ) and −3.7 +/- 1.0 kg ( high protein ). There were no differences between groups.. Weight loss at 12 months was not different from baseline in either group. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c. Secondary endpoints included changes in weight, lipids, blood pressure, renal function, and calcium loss. In contradistinction, the weight loss was not significantly greater among the HP group and 7.3 kg ( 1.5 - 2.2 kg ), but they had a significant reductions in triacylglycerols ( TAG ) ( 21 % ) and the ratio of TAG/HDL cholesterol ( 23 % ). CONCLUSIONS A diet characterized by low carbohydrate and high protein intake was associated with increased total and LDL cholesterol, but not with other metabolic outcomes.. The HP diet had higher protein vs. lower protein diets on health outcomes like adiposity or Cardiovascular risk factors."

We hypothesized that the superiority of varicocele versus the conventional open surgery for varicocele. The study included 298 patients with varicoceles.. The patients were included in the study. The study was based on a retrospective chart review. All patients were treated by an open inguinal technique in 92, laparoscopy in 94 and subinguinal microsurgery. The outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. The intraoperative and postoperative parameters were assessed by two-dimensional protein electrophoresis, and the pregnancy rate. The mean follow-up was 18 months ( range 11 to 26 ). RESULTS The mean hospital stay was significantly longer than that for the other two groups. At the level of protein, a total of 3 protein spots were identified whose expression was significantly lower in group 1 compared to the control group. No testicular atrophy occurred in either group. In 11 testis units, the mean sperm concentration at baseline, and 23.7 % and 33.8 % of patients after the surgery. The overall study showed that varicocele was significantly higher in those patients who underwent surgery, there was a significant improvement of sperm count at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months ( P <.01 ). The incidence of bilateral varicocele was lower than in controls. The surgical treatment of varicocele remains a controversial multifaceted disease process with numerous biological consequences including infertility, hypogonadism, and chronic orchidalgia.

27487986," The authors examined whether the dietary composition of a breakfast that could facilitate performance after an overnight fast remains unclear. In the current study, the possible association between omega-3 LCPUFAs in blood and cognitive performance of children. The objectives of this study were to identify the effects of a 9-wk r and omly assigned diet of mixed grains versus a regular diet on cognitive performance and on levels of plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) and S100B, a calcium-binding protein produced by astroglial cells. A total of seventy-four school children were matched and, if so, explored how these changes correlated with the changes in cognitive performance. The study was a cluster-r and omised cross-over trial comparing school meals with placebo or no breakfast. The REDI intervention promoted gains on two EF measures, which partially mediated intervention effects on school readiness. The average Omega-3 Index was 3.83 % ( SD 0.60 ). Regression analyses between the Alpha and Beta indices and the cognitive performance were significant. Low-GI meals predicted feeling more alert and happy, and less nervous and thirsty. The latter indicated that children with good reading comprehension were also more inattentive and impulsive ( i.e. higher d2-test error% ). The intervention improved'school performance'( P=0·015 ),'reading comprehension ` ( P = 0·043 ) and EPA+DHA status 0·21 ( 95 % CI 0·15, 0·27 ) w/w % ( P<0·001 )..

While it is the most common treatment, it might not always be the best one. The final sample consisted of 23 children with ADHD ( 11 boys and 12 girls, 7 - 14 years old ). All of the children with a DSM-IV-TR ADHD diagnosis were enrolled and received neurofeedback ( NFB ), and physical activity ( PA ). A 3-point growth model assessed change over time across the conditions on the Conners 3–Parent Assessment Report ( Conners 6-month testing.. The outcomes were compared between the two groups... Treatment was monitored to age 18, and naturalistic subgroups were formed based on three patterns of theta/sensorimotor rhythm ( SMR)-training.. Results : Significant improvements were observed in the ADHD-rating scale ( NF ), and the control group. For the follow-up, hypothesis-generating analyses were performed on outcomes in early adulthood ( at 25 years of age ).. Planned comparisons were used to estimate ADHD-LNCG differences reflecting persistence of symptoms and naturalistic subgroup differences reflecting benefit ( symptom reduction ) and cost ( height suppression ). This systematic review and meta- analysis addresses the sustainability of neurofeedback and control treatment effects by considering r and omized controlled studies that conducted 6 months.. Given learning principles underlie NF, there was no significant treatment effect, ie, group × time interaction ( F1,39 = 0.36, P =.554 ). Conclusion : Neurofeedback treatment of ADHD, in combination with the limited knowledge of their effectiveness, may be expected.

We hypothesized that a daily bout of exercise can not compensate the negative effects of inactivity during the rest of the day on the metabolic health of older adults. Methods : Three hundred seventeen enrollees in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention underwent  T1 MRI ; a subset also underwent 11C-Pittsburgh compound B, PET ( n = 186 ) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. We conducted a systematic review and compared the effects of PA. Participants were randomized to either an aerobic activity group or a stretching and toning group. Structural equation modeling was employed to conduct multiple sample latent growth curve analyses of individual growth in measures of SWB ( happiness, satisfaction with life, and loneliness ). RESULTS The plasma incremental area under the curve ( iAUC ) for insulin differed between interventions ( overall P < 0.001 ). Regular activity breaks lowered values by 866.7 ± 3.9 to 79.1 + /- 5.0 mmol glucose/kg muscle ), and the simple question naire inversely associated with anthropometric indexes, but no association was seen between PA estimates and cardiovascular components. We conclude that both PA question naires were associated with lower systolic blood pressure ( SB ), the morning after the 4 days of each regime. In the sitting regime, daily energy expenditure was about 500 kcal lower than in both other regimes.. The physical activity group had significantly smaller increases in body fat over 5 years compared with other groups ( all P <.05 )...

24798823," OBJECTIVES To estimate the relation between gait speed alone and the risk of death  in older people, both overall and with regard to the main causes of death. Design Prospect i ve cohort study. Setting Dijon centre ( France ) of the Three-City study. Participants 3208 men and women aged ≥65 living in the community, recruited from 1999 to 2001, and followed for an average of 5.1 years. Main outcome measures Mortality, overall and according to the main cause of death, by thirds of baseline walking speed ( measured at maximum speed over six metres ), were used to calculate the MICD, as an absolute and percentage value, for the T25FW test. Causes of death : Results During 16 414 person years of follow-up, 209 participants died ( 99 from cancer, 59 from cardiovascular disease, 51 from other causes ). Participants In the lowest third of baseline gait speed had an increased risk of mortality ( hazard ratio 1.44, 95 % confidence interval 1.03 to 1.99 ). Interventions A structured exercise program versus health education. Measurements 400MWT, 4MGS, SPPB. Results Relationships between self-report and performance measures were consistent between treatment arms. Minimally significant change estimates were 1.92, 1.46 to 5.84 ). Irrespective of treatment group, participants categorized ‘ minimally improved ’ by the CGI had a mean improvement in gait speed when both Pra and primary physician's risk estimate were included. Furthermore, gait speed change performed poorly in discriminating change in self-reported mobility. Conclusion Slow walking speed is a simple and effective test that may identify a subset of vulnerable elderly patients at incrementally higher risk of morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery.

19251060," BACKGROUND. A prospect i ve study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the cervical spine ( C-spine ) radiography in alert and stable trauma patients. The trial was designed to assess the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of a cervical spine imaging protocol. The study included patients who had an extremely low probability of injury and who consequently have no need for imaging studies. The scans were mixed r and omly with thirty-seven patients with cervical spine injuries, for whom cervical-spine films were ordered and for whom prospect i e data question naires were completed. RESULTS : The patients were prospect ively evaluated with a test- retest design with blinded raters using a st and ardized examination. The MRI examination was performed 2 - 9 ( mean 6 ) years after the accident. The intra-observer agreement was poor for diagnosis into three categories as hard or soft disc or both. The radiologists documented whether the plain radiographs were adequate and whether they showed an acute process. The findings in the study were compared with the initial findings. The sensitivity of diagnosis of a hard disc was high ( 87 % ) but specificity was low ( 92 % ). The three scales showed good sensitivity to change. The ANOVA showed that at 26 levels there was no differences for any of these variables between patients with neck pain.. The patients classified as unlikely to have an injury according to the decision instrument had the highest correlation with patient's overall assessment ( r = 0.592 ). The literature on assessment of neck pain is large and of variable quality. The authors believe that the literature on neck pain has been insufficient. The published literature on the assessment of cervical spine lesions is large, of tentative value. The current literature on cervical spine pain was limited and of low sensitivity.

25001582," BACKGROUND : Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) is a chronic condition that afflicts young adults in their economically productive years. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of IBD on work productivity, daily activities, and quality of life in an open-label trial ( N=945 ). The population comprised both infliximab-naïve and -exposed patients, including infliximab primary non-responders. The two groups were similar in marital status, the frequency of severe family or sexual problems, and the incidence of IBD. At the 10-year follow-up data on WD were collected. A r and om group of 100 patients ( 38 men and 62 women ) were brought to hospital for review five or more years after surgery. The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Question naire and Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Question naires were compared. At week 54, patients with flare or nonresponse could have their dosage increased to 40 mg sc weekly. Patients were followed for a minimum of six months or until death. The overall disability rate in the IBD population was 18.8 %. At Week 20, 60 % of Crohn's-related patients were in full time and three in part time employment, one was self employed, four were housewives, and only six were involuntarily unemployed. The RR for DP was highest in patients with a stoma, while patients in remission at week 30 were employed ( 20.6 % ) and not receiving disability compensation.. The results of the study were to systematic ally review evidence on work-related outcomes and leads to high societal costs due to sick leave and disability pension.. In general employment prospect s and time off work were good and employers should be encouraged to take an optimistic and to evaluate whether medical or surgical interventions have a positive impact on patients'work ability."

To determine whether a multicomponent nutrition intervention program at a corporate site reduces body weight and improves other cardiovascular risk factors in a multicenter randomized controlled trial. The intervention group experienced subjective relief of rheumatic symptoms during intervention. A return to an omnivorous diet for the first 2 weeks and a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet for one of two 6-week experimental periods. RESULTS : Participants were r and omly assigned to a diet following 2003 American Diabetes Association guidelines or a low-fat, vegan diet for 74 weeks... Changes in body weight, anthropometric measures, blood pressure, and those in the second replication ( N = 34 ) were assessed at weeks 0, 11, 22, 35, 48, 61, and 74.. The mean body weight was measured at baseline and biweekly thereafter for 12 weeks. For diet-acceptability measures, the related sample s Wilcoxon sum rank test assessed within-group changes ; the independent sample s Mann-Whitney U test compared the diet groups. Differences in lifestyle factors including smoking, physical activity and education level accounted for less than 5 % of the difference in mean age-adjusted BMI between meat-eaters and vegans. The decrease in weight changes that occur when vegetarian diets are prescribed have not been well quantified. We estimated the effect on body weight after vegetarian diets."
15654706," BACKGROUND The tricyclic antidepressant trimipramine is an effective treatment for agitation or agitation due to mental illness... The validity of the scale was assessed in a double blind study of 18 patients treated with maximum tolerated dosage ( mean 18.8 mg/day ). The authors postulate that agitation should be conceptualized as a continuum of expressions that extends from anxiety to aggression. The study was not based on evidence from r and omised trials. The incidence of states of agitation was 0.56 %. There were 43 women and 57 men, mean age 33 years.  Treatment efficacy was measured using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, The Clinical Global Impressions scale, and the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale. The findings suggest that antiparkinson prophylaxis is useful during commencement of therapy with haloperidol-promethazine combination. In these data, ICCs were inversely related to cluster size, but the difference was not significant. The drugs used in this situation should ensure that the person swiftly and safely becomes calm.

31167038," BACKGROUND The benefits of antihypertensive treatment in older adults with hypertension. The effectiveness of diltiazem, an angiotensin-receptor blocker, would reduce this risk in older patients with hypertension, the incidence of complications and mortality in the two treatment groups was compared to the placebo group. The randomized controlled trial of the elderly patients with systolic hypertension ( STOP-Hypertension ) was a prospect i ve cohort study. The participants were randomized to receive either placebo, or active treatment. The trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 2553 patients r and omly assigned to either placebo or treatment ( n=221 ). The results are inconclusive essentially because the risk reduction is mild.. The mean ( SD ) age was 61 ( 10 ) years. The primary endpoint was fatal and non-fatal stroke, and the secondary endpoint was the percentage of men ( 34 % ) and those > or = 75 years ( P = 0.14 ). The mean duration of follow-up was 2.6 years. In the study, the mean percentage of patients who died was less than 1. The placebo group had more than the 2.1 % of total mortality than did the control group ( P=0.03 ). When both of these endpoints were combined, 22.4 % of participants had a BMI of 26.0 and for those < 75 underwent a procedure ; the curve was quite flat for women across a wide range of BMI s. The mean difference in stroke incidence was -12.5 mmol/8 hr ( -23 % ) ;  The primary composite end point was more strongly associated with age - most rapidly over age 60. The incidence of hypertension and hypertension was not significantly different between the groups. The second substantive up date of this review was originally published in 1998 and was previously up date d in 2009. Elevated blood pressure ( known as'hypertension).). .

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE : Study participants included in the systematic review and published between 2008–2011 were included. The corresponding or first authors completed a survey covering all NOS items. Results were compared with the NOS assessment applied by review ers of the same cohort. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using kappa ( K ) statistics. The development of genitals, breasts, and pubic hair was recorded annually from 9 to 16 y of age. The overall NOS score was significantly higher ( p < 0.001 ) in those who experienced a higher BMI ( median = 6 ; interquartile range [ IQR ] 6–6 ). Girls who experienced rapid growth ( defined as increasing across two major Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth percentiles ) in early infancy had an average age at menarce that was 4.6 months earlier than girls whose growth was stable. CONCLUSIONS Faster postnatal weight gains in infancy and early childhood before the age of 4 years are associated with earlier age at Menarche. The two groups had similar testosterone levels. The relationship between obesity and puberty timing based on scientific evidence."
27178217," BACKGROUND : Vitamin D has a role in regulating immune function, and its deficiency is a suggested risk factor for childhood pneumonia. Our aim was to assess whether oral supplementation of vitamin D3 ( cholecalciferol ) will reduce the incidence and severity of pneumonia in children. OBJECTIVE : To determine the association between plasma vitamin D concentrations at birth and the subsequent risk of RSV LRTI. DESIGN : A prospect i ve birth cohort study was performed in healthy term neonates. In the first, in which participants were pretreated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25OHD ), their parents, and 1008 r and om, population controls. Vitamin D or placebo was given by fieldworkers once every 3 months for 18 months. RESULTS : The primary outcome was the number of parent-reported ARIs over the past 3 months.  There was no significant difference in the mean number of days to recovery between the vitamin D(3 ) ( 4.74 days ; SD 2.22 ) and placebo arms ( 4-98 days ; SE 2.89 ; P = 0.17 ). The incidence of first or only pneumonia within 90 days of supplementation was significantly different ( 0·145 per child per year, 95 % CI 0·129–0·164 ). Compared with controls, children receiving vitamin D reported significantly fewer ARIs during the study period ( mean : 0.80 vs 0.45, P =.047 ).. The role of innate immunity as a process was reinforced by association of the whole group of innate immune SNPs when the global test for groups of genes was applied ( P=.046 ). Conclusion A single high-dose oral vitamin D₃ supplementation to young children along with antibiotic treatment for pneumonia could reduce to the majority of children with LRTI, to a lesser extent."

The study included the following:. Dietary fat ( corn oil ) and monounsaturated fatty acid-rich extra-virgin olive oil. The subjects were divided into two groups.. The placebo group received corn oil... the test diets were kept at 4 % total energy and the cholesterol intake at 400 mg/d. The palm oil was compared with the diet. The olive oil-enriched diet ( 40 % fat, 22 % of energy ), followed by a 4-wk period of a sunflower oil ( EVOO ). The corn-oil diet exerted a small, statistically significant reduction of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ), and HDL cholesterol ( P < 0.05 ), but they also lowered plasma total apo B concentrations ( -3.8 % ).. There were no significant changes in serum HDL-C, total cholesterol or the ratio of TC/HDL cholesterol ( apo A-I.. ).. Production of IL-6 and TNF-alpha was significantly higher after the PA group compared to the control group ( P = 0.01 ).  The study showed that the lipid concentrations were significantly higher. The dietary intervention was to decrease the LDL cholesterol. In this study, the content of the HDL cholesterol was not significantly different between the groups.

18058281," BACKGROUND Seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) is a subtype of major depression with a regular occurrence of symptoms in autumn/winter and full remission in spring/summer. This study investigated whether the diagnosis of SAD, a novel wake-promoting agent, as treatment for seasonal affective episode, and the role of light therapy. The authors studied the efficacy of bright light treatment as a preventive measure. Twelve out- patients with winter SAD were assigned to either a bright light or placebo group, in addition to a nonphotic control, negative air treatment. The clinical characteristics of these three seasonal groups and their response to the treatment were compared. RESULTS No significant difference in the clinical outcome between the 2 groups. The mean treatment duration was 6 weeks. The seasonal pattern of "" feeling worst "" exhibited a bimodal distribution with a greater winter and a substantially lower summer peak ( ratio, 4.5:1 ).. The majority of patients entered phase II and 35 completed it. The crude prevalence of lifetime SAD was 2.6 % ( 95 % CI, 1.9 to 3.5 ). There was no impact of latitude on prevalence of either major depression or the seasonal subtype. The diagnosis and severity of SAD was significantly better than placebo at endpoint. The improvement of SAD seems to be heterogeneous as research on circadian, neurotransmitter function and genetic hypotheses have shown discrepant results. A dual vulnerability model with differential loading on separate seasonal and depression factors has been proposed to explain these findings. The incidence of SAD and SAD is high, the prevalence of SAD is low. The study suggests that seasonal depression and SAD may be different from other similar conditions such as subsyndromal SAD and atypical depression.

24266676," Study Design. A prospect i ve cohort study of patients with chronic low back pain.. To determine the relation between a marketed opto‐electric device measuring trunk kinematics, a widely used specific functional capacity question naire, and work status. The study investigated the efficacy of a specific exercise intervention in the management of back pain, and to compare the effect of these in two treatment strategies - chiropractic and physiotherapy. Summary of Background Data. The aim of this study was to replicate the findings of a previous study of the lumbar spine. The patients were r and omly allocated to a fitness programme or control group. The treatment and placebo groups were well matched in physical characteristics, the severity, duration, and who had not been treated within the previous month. RESULTS The majority of patients in both groups showed comparable improvement in measures of physical fitness at 8 weeks. The mean Oswestry score and the ODI as a gold standard of outcome measures. The ODI was significantly higher in patients who completely central ized ( p = 0.015 ). The results supported the hypothesis that subjects who centralize will have improved functional outcome and, thus, more than the placebo group.. The improvement in pain and disability variables was significant ( p < 0.01 ), whereas it was modestly significant ( rs = -0.33, p <.05 ) between the two groups. The overall results showed a low and non‐significant correlation between pain severity and ODI, but the outcome measures were significantly different. The pain and ODI scores were significantly lower in those patients who received Harpagophytum, and for those who received placebo. It has now been 20 years since its original publication."
28826406," Background Sarcopenia is a decrease in both muscle mass and strength. It remains unclear whether sarcopenia is associated with morbidity after gastric cancer surgery. This study evaluated the impact of sarcopenia and postoperative outcomes after gastrectomy. We design ed a study to determine if frailty predicts surgical complications and enhances current perioperative risk models. METHODS The predictive values of chronological age and frailty were investigated in a large community sample of persons aged 65 years and older undergoing a major operation requiring postoperative intensive care unit admission were enrolled.  Preoperative muscle function was measured by h and grip strength ( HGS ). The cutoff values were the gender-specific lowest 20 %. Grade 2 or higher morbidities, as retrospectively evaluated by the Clavien – Dindo classification, were obtained from the patient record. The risk factors for morbidity were examined by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results Morbidity was observed in 39 patients ( 13.3 % ), including 7 with pancreatic leakage, 12 with anastomotic leakage, and 4 with intraabdominal abscesses. In univariate analysis, sarcopenia ( p < 0.001 ), nutritional risk ( NRS 2002 score ≥3 ; p = 0.003 ), advanced age ( ≥75 years ), male gender, and increased comorbidities ( P < 0,001 ). Similar statistical relationships were found for all 6 markers and postdischarge institutionalization. Logistic regression identified any functional dependence ( odds ratio 13.9 ) as the strongest predictor of 6-month mortality. Four or more markers in any one patient predicted 6-months mortality with a sensitivity of 81 % ( 13/16 ) and specificity of 86 % ( 81/94 ). Conclusions : Geriatric assessment markers for frailty, disability and comorgity predict postoperative outcomes in older people who undergo gastric surgery."
28938794," BACKGROUND. To examine the effects of a low-fat vegetarian diet on serum lipid and lipid concentrations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The subjects were r and omized into a vegan diet group ( n 16 ), who consumed a vegetarian diet for 2 - 3 months ,  or  into  a control group.. The aim was to assess the effect of replacing red meat in the usual diet ( UD ) with chicken ( CD ) and of consuming a lactovegetarian low-protein diet ( LPD ). The levels of serum cholesterol, plasma lipid concentrations, blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1C ) were determined at baseline and 18 weeks. Results : Mean body weight fell 2.9 kg and 0.06 kg in  the intervention and control groups, respectively ( P<0.001 ). Total and low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol fell 8.0 and 8.1 mg/dl, respectively. The partial substitution of lean meat for plant protein in a fat-modified diet did not negate the overall cardiovascular-risk lowering of the vegan diet.. Hemoglobin A(1c ) changes from baseline to 74 wk ( n = 16 ; control ), was significantly greater than the 12 % decrease in LDL, the same diet plus lovastatin, and this declined by 1.0 % ( P = 0.01 ). Serum total and LDL cholesterol were not observed to be significantly different. The mean weight loss was 7.2 ± 1.8 kg in both diet groups and placebo group. In addition, the average percent diameter stenosis at baseline decreased 1.75 absolute percentage points after 1 year ( a 4.5 % relative improvement ) and by 3.1 % after 12 months ( p= 0.61 ).. The association between vegetarian diets and long-term effects on plasma lipids has not been subjected to meta- analysis. Objective The study showed that adoption of a vegetarian diets significantly reduces plasma cholesterol, though not significantly. and).A"
25636220," We investigated whether the effects of medium-chain triacylglycerols ( MCT ) have been suggested as efficacious in weight management in humans. The study was conducted under a double-blind, controlled protocol, we assessed the effect of MCT, nutritional status, and energy expenditure, substrate oxidation, and body weight loss compared with LCT. PROCEDURES Twenty-four healthy men and women ( body mass index ( BMI ) > or = 23 kg/m(2 ) ) consumed diets rich in MCT or LCT for 28 days each in a crossover r and omized controlled trial. At baseline and after 4 weeks of each dietary intervention, energy expenditure was measured using indirect calorimetry, while body composition was analyzed using magnetic resonance imaging. The  LCT group consisted of 50 subjects ( 34 men and 16 women ), while the MLCT group included 51 subjects ( 33 men and 18 women ) who completed the study. The diets were administered over 4 weeks. Body composition was measured with DEXA and total fat, and lipid oxidation ( interaction between meal and time : P < 0.05 ). In post hoc tests, the 3 modified fats result ed in significantly higher postpr and ial energy expenditure and fat oxidation than did the conventional fat. The mean decrease in serum total cholesterol was greater in the MCT group than in those who consumed LCT. The MCT group showed a significant decrease in body weight ( -2.1 ( SE 0.4 ) kg, P=0.0015 ), but the difference in body fat was not significantly different between the LCT group. The results suggest that the daily intake of MCTs, specifically C8:0 and C10:0,  on weight loss and body composition in adults."

Methods : We studied consecutive patients undergoing implantation of drug-eluting stents  to receive 6- or 12-month DAPT. The primary end point was a target vessel failure, defined as the composite of cardiac death, myocardial infa rct ion, or stroke. The secondary end points were the primary outcome was total stroke and mortality. Patients were pretreated with aspirin and clopidogrel.. The outcomes were compared between groups in terms of age, gender, history, risk factors, or incidence of diabetes.. After PCI, most patients ( > 80 % ) in both groups received open-label thienopyridine for about 4 weeks, after which study drug was restarted.. A total of 543 patients were recruited and followed for 90 days. At one week RHI increased by 20±10 % in those who received clopidogrel. At 6 months, 158 ( 12.34 % ) of 1280 patients taking aspirin treated with clopidogrel compared with the placebo group ( 9.6 % ). The proportion of patients with a stroke compared with placebo group was not significant ( 0.64 % vs. 1.52 %, p=0.03 ). In contrast, the median number of microembolic events on transcranial doppler was also similar ( 6.4 % versus 3.3 %... aspirin is the prophylactic antiplatelet drug of choice for people with cardiovascular disease..

31172295," The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term associations of dietary intake, total and relative edible plate waste and self-reported food likings between healthy school-aged children. We investigated whether dietary interventions could improve serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25(OH)D ) and markers related to bone in 8- to 11-year-old Danish children. The study was a cluster-r and omised controlled trial. Participants were 30–65 years of age, with body mass index 27–40 kg/m2, and the usual packed lunch ( control ).  Food intake and plate waste ( n 1558 ) were calculated after weighing lunch plates before and after the meal for five consecutive days. The control group was recorded over seven consecutive days using a vali date d Web-based Dietary Assessment Software for Children. The NND result ed in higher intakes of potatoes ( 130 %, 95 % CI 2·07, 2·58 ), fish ( 48 %,95 % CI 1·33, 1·65 ), and other foods. The decrease in error percentage was 0·18 points smaller ( P<0.001 ) in the intervention group than in those without the control group ( medians : baseline 2·03 % ; intervention 1·46 % ; control 1·37 % ). The intervention improved'school performance'( P=0·015 ), the number of correct sentences ( 1·8 ± 0.5 ) and insulin resistance ( P = 0.03 ), but not for the weight or LDL-C. The present study tried to determine the effect of the ND on the markers of blood glucose control using a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled clinical trials ( RCTs ).Conclusion : The present findings suggest that the dietary intake of a healthy Nordic food index was not associated with the glycemic control or the risk of diabetes among the children..

RESULTS : The Index is intended to provide the basis for a st and ard measure of basic genetic knowledge that can be applied across diverse population s and research setting s. The study group was composed of 330 European Americans selected r and omly in the Louisville, KY, metropolitan area. The final version of the  Genetic Knowledge Index ( GKI ) consisted of five items identified by principle components analysis, correlation coefficients, and the alpha measure of internal consistency.. Results : All participants had some familial history of breast cancer, but none had a family history indicative of autosomal dominant genetic mutation. The Index provides a numerical ranking of subjects'knowledge of practical genetics.. The women knew more about methods for fetal karyotyping, what they thought were important, than about the outcomes. In the remaining 16 ( 32 % ) cases a totally different outcome measures were available to evaluate clinical genetics services ( CGS ). The  SWD  scale predicts decision certainty in this study... Changes in beliefs about genetic testing ( e.g., beliefs about potential stigma associated with testing ) were compared with the effects of counseling.. Further investigation in relation to the 33 provisional prenatal diagnoses could be effective in helping women underst and their cancer risk and appropriate risk assessment options and can be implemented successfully within a service program."

The study is a hospital outpatient prescription level analysis that adopts a pretest-posttest control group experiment design. Selected measures of outpatient prescription drug utilization are examined for Medicare beneficiaries in a HCBS program from January 1, 2005, and April 31, 2007. The paper used HIE data from four sites to estimate how drug expenditures vary by insurance plan, and to compare the plan response for drugs with that for all ambulatory expenses. RESULTS : The lowest, 25th percentile, median and highest EAC plans were obtained for each patient in each region for the study using a stratified r and om sampling method. The observational analysis included all Pharmacare beneficiaries ( excluding the 386 exempt patients ) who had used any nebulised drugs, the rate of increase was significantly less in the non cost-sharing group. The cost sharing reduced inappropriate and appropriate antibiotic use to a similar degree. The Medicare prescription drug benefit proposals that rely on voluntary enrollment may also experience adverse selection from frail, low-income beneficiaries.

The effects of the administration of oral L-carnitine ( 2 g/day ) for 28 days were compared in the management of 51 ( carnitine group ) and 50 ( placebo group ) patients with suspected acute myocardial infa rct ion. The 2 groups received either 2 g ALC twice a day ( n = 30 ) or placebo. Clinical and laboratory assessment, psychometric tests and automated electroencephalogram ( EEG ) were performed for all patients. At the end of treatment, the mean liver function test and peripheral blood mitochondrial DNA and 8-oxo-dG quantitive analysis were conducted. The disappearance of XOD/HYP-induced  SSBs during the initial repair period was quite slow, and after 3 weeks of supplementation. The ALT normalization at 3 months was 58.9 % for the monotherapy and 95.2 % for  the combination therapy ( P<0.0001 ). The liver function and the basal lipid profile were similar. There were no significant changes in either group after the intervention in insulin sensitivity ( 3.2 +/- 1.2 vs. 4.5 ± 1.7 mg/kg/min, p = 0.115 ), and for alcoholic fatty liver ( AFLD ), but the additional SSBs were found to be significant ( p=0.001 ), total cholesterol ( p < 0.01 ), low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) ( P= 0.000 ), NH4 + 30.5 vs 13.0 % )..

The smoking status of a surgical patient may be confounded by social and medical parameters. We have evaluated the effect of smoking in a test wound in volunteers, with special reference to a reliable scientific match between smokers and nonsmokers. METHODS In a prospect i ve open study with blinded assessment, 19 smoking ( 20 cigarettes/day ) and 18 nonsmoking healthy volunteers were matched with respect to baseline characteristics. The univariate analysis showed the following significant risk factors : race, tobacco consumption, clinical stage, comorbidities, time duration of the surgical procedure, and flap reconstruction.. The final model by logistic regression identified that smoking was not predictive of morbidity except that it was predictive of less probability of need for intra-aortic balloon pump ( 7.5 % ), and 6.30 ( 95 % CI 4.80 - 8.26 ). The combination of ASA classification greater than 1 and smoking than in non-smokers ( 50 % and 17 % ). In the cohort study, the prevalence of cigarette smoking was 58.9 % in men and 7.6 % in women ( P = 0.001 ).

The introduction of alternative treatment strategies for the treatment of Dupuytsren ’s contracture. The authors compared the effectiveness of both techniques in a prospective cohort study. The patients with 2 or more contractures in the same h and caused by palpable cords participated in a 60-day, multicenter, open-label, phase 3b study.. The treatment was measured by the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and H and ( DASH ) question naire. The mean of 1.2 injections were used per patient and 0.8 injections per joint. The outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. The primary end point was the percent of patients maintaining clinical success ( reduction of contracture to 0 ° –5 ° ) at 90 days post-injection. Secondary end points were: the mean age was 66. All patients were treated with a single injection of collagenase, and that of a collagenase pathway was 7.5 %. The majority of patients ( 92 % ) had a reduction in contracture ( 20 % ) and the majority of those ( 67 % ) were satisfied with the outcome. The median time away from work and duration of physical therapy ( total = 6 days ) was less than 1 week after treatment. The incidence of clinical success was 65 % in metacarpophalangeal joints and 29 % in proximal interphalangeal joints. The overall treatment-related AEs were mild to moderate, resolving without intervention ; the most common were swelling of treated extremity, contusion, and pain in extremity. The average duration of hospitalization was 2.3 days, the patients in both groups were comparable to rates in prior studies. CONCLUSIONS Collagenase clostridium injection was not significantly different from limited fasciectomy in reducing metacarpophalangeal joint contractures, and it led to more complications than the other. and)."
23558383," The goal of this study was to use the model of spinal cord isolation ( SI ), which blocks nearly all neuromuscular activity while leaving the motoneuron muscle-fiber connections intact, to characterize the cellular processes linked to marked muscle atrophy. The current study was design ed to test the validity of a minimally invasive technique : the microbiopsy. We compared RCT publications with investigator reports of actual practice for 40 rheumatology RCTs published in 1997/1998. In RCTs in which these methods were not described in the trial reports and would thus have been characterized as "" inadequate, "" investigators reported using methods of r and om-sequence generation and allocation concealment that would be considered adequate in 77.4 and 78.1 % of RCTs, respectively. In African runners, TTF was 21 % longer ( P < 0.01 ), plasma lactate accumulation after 5 min at 88 % PTV was 38 % lower than in women. Variations in age, smoking habits, and physical activity did not influence muscle morphology data substantially. Thus, in a normal population, men have larger muscle fibers than women, but similar fiber composition. The muscle fiber size was not significantly different between the 2 groups. The PFK activity didn't differ statistically between these two groups, but the agreement was moderate. The reduction in muscle fiber cross-sectional area ( CSA ) was a widely acknowledged marker of weakness, but no reference values for the muscle fiber CSA at the age of the onset of chronic disease have ever been published."
28024721," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between the outcomes of a pre-operative comprehensive geriatric assessment ( CGA ) and the risk of severe post-operative complications in patients with head and neck cancer. DESIGN Prospect i ve cohort study. PATIENTS AND METHODS Cohort study of 479 patients with stage III to IV carcinoma treated with surgery or combined therapy.  All of the recruited patients were assessed on several clinical and psychosocial characteristics during a pretreatment clinic visit and then at 3- and 12-month follow-up appointments. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between preoperative depressive symptoms  ( PDS ) and postoperative functional performance status ( PFPS ), and age-related inclusion criteria. RESULTS All dichotomized HRQOL sum scores except the functional score ( P =.20 ) were significantly predictive of survival. The 5-year cumulative incidence of adverse health outcomes was 19.6 % ( 95 % CI, 15.8 to 23.4 ). Older age was associated with a higher proportion of nonpersistence, and PFPS was assessed 12 months postoperatively on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head & Neck ( FACT-HN ) scale. In comparison with trials not design ed for older adults, trials designed for elderly contained a significantly larger median number of participants  ( 125 vs. 80, p = 0.008 ). The difference between those with and without geriatric assessment was significant. The association of functional or cognitive impairment, social environment and frailty with poor health outcomes.. The 2-, 3-, and 5- year OS rate was 20.2 % and 18.3 %, respectively. The study demonstrates that older age, the incidence of PDS, the clinical stage ( oral cavity versus other ; HR=1.37 to 1.63 )... Older head and head cancer patients are at increased risk for poor outcomes, they have a higher incidence of morbidity and mortality.+A)."
29278423," BACKGROUND To assess whether a training intervention likely to elicit adaptations in the leg could improve walking ability in people with intermittent claudication. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a group-mediated cognitive behavioral intervention promoting home-based walking exercise training for patients with peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) ) improves walking capacity. : Among participants with PAD, we determined whether they were r and omized to exercise treatment or usual care.  The intervention was a 6-month supervised treadmill walking program.. The exercise program consisted of intermittent walking to nearly maximal walking distances, and walking speed. The control group attended weekly lectures. During months 6 to 12, each group received telephone contact only. Primary outcomes were the following:. Two tests used the new protocol while the remaining trial used to the established protocol.. Of 24 participants ( 58 % ), the exercise group had improved their peak walking distance ( P <.001 ). The walking speed and total walking distance were evaluated before and after the interventions. The intervention group had greater improvement in their WIQ walking speed score than the control subjects ( P =.05 ). In treated subjects, maximal calf blood flow ( measured by a plethysmograph ) increased 38 + /- 45 % ( p less than 0.05 ), but the change in these outcomes was not correlated with the increase in peak walking time. CONCLUSIONS Exercise programmes are a relatively inexpensive, low-risk option compared with other, more invasive therapies for treatment of leg pain on walking. The study showed that exercise programme was effective in alleviating symptoms and increasing walking times, reducing cardiovascular events, and improving quality of life. The results suggest that an exercise programme is effective in preventing walking disability, reducing the incidence of walking disability and improving gait times.. Secondary objectives: the study found that a supervised training program was effective to improve walking tolerance, reducing walking thresholds and walking trials..).A rehabilitation.

30219553," BACKGROUND : Surgical site infections ( SSI ) are a common complication after colorectal surgery. We performed a r and omized prospect i ve study to evaluate whether the presence or absence of a preoperative bowel prep in  elective pediatric bowel surgery  on postoperative outcomes. METHODS A survey was design ed and administered to a nationwide group of pediatric surgeons to ascertain current practice s of bowel preparation. RESULTS Four hundred ninety-three surveys were administered, and 136 physicians responded ( 28 % ).  Mechanical bowel preparation was used by 96 % of the respondents. Preoperative  intravenous antibiotics  were used by 99 % of respondents. The number of years in practice did not significantly affect the use of oral antibiotics  ( P =.62 ) or the duration of intravenous antibiotics.. The incidence of all patients were pre-admitted ( n=5,473 ), and the most common diagnoses were anorectal malformations ( 55 % ), inflammatory bowel disease ( 26 %, and Hirschsprung's Disease ( 19 % ) ). The most common preparation approaches were MBP alone ( 54.3 % ) ; MBP+oral antibiotics ( 18.8 % ) and oral antibiotics alone ( 4.2 % ). The results of this pilot study suggest that omitting MBP before elective intestinal operations in infants and children carries no increased risk of infectious or anastomotic complications. In multivariate analysis compared to patients in Group 1, the odds of surgical complications were 0.72 ( 95 % CI 0.40 - 1.29, P=0.28 ) with MBP monotherapy ( Group 2 ). The mean patient age was 62 ± 1.2 years, and 54 % were men. Preoperative diagnoses included colorecectal cancer ( 57 % ), diverticulitis ( 6.3% ), or benign polyp disease."
22083832," BACKGROUND To evaluate national practice for antibiotic prophylaxis in cardiac surgery with respect to the use of protocol s, agent selection and duration of administration. Our objective was to identify risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery from September, 1977, to August, 1978. There were no statistically significant differences in frequency of postoperative infections in these two antibiotic groups. Chest wound and donor site infections and early prosthetic valve endocarditis occurred more frequently with cefonicid ( 11 patients, 6.3 % ) than with cefam and ole ( 4 patients, 2.2 % ). In the study group ( n = 28 ) a prolonged regimen of prophylaxis with ticarcillin/clavulanate was performed for 2 days and vancomycin was added in a low dose until removal of the intraaortic balloon pump. Twenty-five miscellaneous postoperative infections ( urinary tract infection, pneumonia, intravenous site infection, bacteremia, and so on ). No patients with tracheobronchitis was observed. The median hospital length of stay was significantly longer in the prophylaxis group and 8 days in those on the control group ( p = 0.20 ). Over 4 years, the proportion of patients who had VAP or not was, respectively, 25.5 versus 3 days ( P < 0.001 ). The incidence of pneumonia was significantly higher in patients with preoperative positive tracheal aspirates ( 60.7 versus 2.8 % ), and timing appropriateness were assessed against 3 international guidelines. CONCLUSIONS AND χ Although the incidence of wound infections was low, there was the following."
28813123," BACKGROUND The study of the effects of antihypertensive treatment on vascular disease in older patients was designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of drug therapy for hypertension. The trial was carried out in consultation with the World Health Organization, the International Society of Hypertension. The patients were under 80 years of age, and the control and treated groups compared well for age, sex, and severity of hypertension.. The participants were randomized 1 : 1 : 2 : 1 to receive either the placebo, a special intensive treatment group, or placebo. The primary endpoint was the incidence of hypertension, while the secondary endpoint was mortality. The study population included patients with hypertension ( systolic pressure 160 - 200 mm Hg ; diastolic pressure < 110 mm Hg ). The results are inconclusive essentially because the risk reduction is mild. The main goal of treatment is to reduce these events. The mortality-rate at the end of a 2 to 5 year followup was 26 % in the treated group and 46 % in control group. The mean duration of follow-up was 2.6 years. Patients must give their informed consent and be free of major cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular diseases. We wanted to know the efficacy of this treatment in reducing the primary endpoint, adverse events and mortality.. Treatment was effective in reducing all-cause mortality in adults aged 18 to 59 years with mild to moderate primary hypertension. In an intention-to-treat analysis, active treatment was associated with a 30 % reduction in stroke, myocardial infa rct ion, heart failure, and renal failure. The major endpoint of treated patients is the number of primary endpoints ( 94 % of those allocated captopril and 65 % of patients allocated atenolol, that is, the rate of adverse events, including stroke, renal failure,. The overall effect of treating hypertension is in people 60 years and older. and.). . We want to quantify adverse events ( including cerebrovascular and coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity ) and to/, }-"
20495984," PURPOSE This study was designed to determine the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of a novel combined-modality treatment for patients with locally advanced squamous carcinoma of the head and neck. METHODS AND MATERIAL S Seventy-five patients with inoperable, nonmetastatic non-small-cell lung cancer received weekly docetaxel ( 36 mg/m2 ) for 6 months, followed by radical prostatectomy, and were monitored with weekly visits, serum prostate-specific antigen measurements, and endorectal magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ). The experimental group received two chemotherapy regimens.. The patients on chemotherapy were tested using Sniffin'Sticks ( Burghart ; Wedel, Germany ) and the patients were assessed for response, survival, and toxicity. RESULTS With a median follow-up of 24 months, only one patient had pathologically confirmed local recurrence. The maximum tolerated dose was 150 mg m−2. Plasma pharmacokinetics were linear. Two patients with heavily pretreated ovarian cancer  showed partial response. The median survival time was not found in the control group. The overall survival rate was 22 % in patients ( p < or =.05 ). Protein intake also increased in both groups. The 5-year locoregional control rate was 48 % in Group 1 and 25 % in Arm 2. The toxicity profile was comparable to that seen following st and ard fractionation. The quality of life was not affected by the chemotherapy, whereas groups 2 and 3 returned to or below baseline levels. The incidence of taste alterations was low in those patients treated with the combined modality ( Arm B ), and oral toxicity was not significantly different between groups, with a trend for reduced symptomatology in group 1 versus group 2/group 3 ( p =.07 ). CONCLUSION Chemotherapy has a significant but transient effect on olfactory and gustatory function, but not on the incidence and severity of +.).A"
21660022," BACKGROUND The purpose of this clinical study was to compare the sensitivity experienced and reported by patients following treatment of primary carious lesions with Class I or Class II amalgam restorations.  METHOD AND MATERIAL S AND METHODS 20 patients received Class I / Class II contralaterally paired restorations which were placed at the same appointment. The authors found no significant reduction in the mean CRM for the group receiving Amalgambond Plus ( Parkell ), but they did find a significant decrease in  the Mean CRM after treatment. Patients were contacted on days 2 and 7 postoperatively and question ed regarding the presence or absence of sensitivity. The group receiving an OptiBond adhesive liner under their amalgam restorations was not found to be any less sensitive to cold, either by timed response to a cold stimulus or by self-report of pain. Data from the response forms were analyzed for differences using a paired t-test.

24729336," BACKGROUND Vitamin D deficiency is the most common cause of postmenopausal osteoporosis, but there is some indication that low calcium intakes adversely influence the pathogenesis of age-related bone loss. The purpose of this study was to determine whether daily doses of vitamin D and vitamin D supplementation can improve bone loss associated with aging. The study was a 2-year, multicenter, placebo-controlled, trial. The subjects consisted of 102 women who were r and omly assigned to the vitamin D3-supplementation protocol s at 1,500 mg daily, or 10,500 IU once weekly, or placebo at baseline and 10 weeks. The BMD of the proximal forearm, lumbar spine, femoral neck, Ward's triangle, and femoral trochanter was measured at 6-mo intervals. RESULTS In the 128 men, there was a mean of 2.2 falls per year compared with 4.0 in the placebo group. The mean serum 25(OH)D was 40.7 + /- 15.4 nmol/L ( P < 0.0001 ). After the trial, serum calcidiol was decreased in both groups compared with placebo. The primary outcome was the change in bone mineral density ( P = 0.05 ) and femoral neck. The secondary outcomes were the percentage change in BMD, the bone turnover markers ( calcidoline and total phosphorus... The treatment group had the lowest BMD. The placebo group..

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The IDEFICS ( Identification and Prevention of Dietary- and Lifestyle-Induced Health Effects in Children and Infants ) study is a prospect i ve cohort study with an intervention component. Data were collected at baseline from September 1, 2007, through June 30, 2008.. The intervention implementation was also assessed.. Using different raters, the checklist was taken in 309 children aged 2–6 years.  Ambulatory electrocardiograms  were collected over 14–18 h comprising a full night and accelerometry over 7 days. HRV was determined of three different night segments : ( 1 ) over 5 min during deep sleep identified automatically based on HRV characteristics ; ( 2 ) during a 20 min segment starting 15 min after sleep onset ; ( 3 ) over a 4-h segment between midnight and 4 a.m.. Linear models were computed for HRV parameters with anthropometric and physical activity variables adjusted for heart rate and other confounding variables ( e.g., age for physical activity models ). Results : We found a decline in heart rate with increasing physical activity and decreasing skinfold thickness. The study was significantly associated with trial outcomes : 1 ) free-access to a movement space and parental information session for motor skills 2 ) highly motivated and trained educators for sleep onset, but not with r and om sleep phases.

27714911," The present study aim ed at analyzing the efficacy of a 6-month intervention of football training program for reducing weight gain in low-income overweight children. Two high school varsity teams were followed prospect ively for injuries after measurement of height, weight, and triceps and subscapular skinfolds during the preseason. The study is design ed as a longitudinal, nonr and omized clinical observation study. Twenty-two overweight children were r and omly assigned to two groups ( age=10.8+/-1.2 years, height=1.56+/-0.08 m, weight= 65.1+/-11.4 kg ). One group conducted a football treatment program, and another group an established st and ard sports program. The overall prevalence of injuries per player per season was 0.28 for players < or = 95th percentile and 0.33 for players above this percentile ( not significant ).. At 3 months, there were significant differences in changes in body weight ( −2.8 ± 2.3 kg vs 1.2 ±2.2 kg ), BMI ( −1.7 ± 1.1 kg/m2 vs −0.2 +/- 1.0 kg/ m2 ), body fat percentage (. In the controls, BMI increased ( P<0.001 ) and BMI -SDS remained constant.. Although a 5-month football intervention program was effective in improving the physical capacity of overweight children but did not significantly alter body composition. This study synthesizes the evidence about the effects of group sports on health-related physical fitness of overweight/obese youth."

BACKGROUND Very high blood pressure during pregnancy poses a serious threat to women and their babies. The use of sublingual nifedipine could be recommended for treating severe preeclampsia, because it now has been used safely for about 30 years, and the introduction of a new drug in pregnancy is a difficult task with partially unknown hazards."
30211331," The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a home-based intervention for autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) in children with autism. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of parent-mediated communication-focused treatment for autism. This study used a single subject comparison design in two different conditions ( Siller et al. in J Autism Dev Disord 2007:540–555, 2013a ). The current analyses focus on children with ASD. Children with ASD, age range 3 to 5 years, who were r and omized to receive an additional program in their homes. The results showed partial mediation, with change in synchrony accounting for 34 % of the positive intervention effect on autism symptomatology. After 12 months, outcomes were measured to determine changes in the groups in social interaction and communication. The PRTG taught parents behavioral techniques to facilitate language development. The intervention was characterised by significant impairment in social communication and the presence of restrictive and repetitive behaviour or interest. We aim to identify the most effective intervention based on cognitive, developmental, and behavioural approaches to autism. The study showed that, compared with the control group, the intervention was found to be significantly associated with improvement of autism symptoms in children. Intervention during early childhood could decrease ASD symptoms."
30865287," Background : The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Lactobacillus reuteri ( L reuteri ), in infants with colic. A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was conducted among infants aged < 5 months with infantile colic. The study was compared with a placebo. In the active arm, mothers excluded cow's milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soy, and fish from their diet. We also compared fecal calprotectin and hematochezia on 26 infants aged less than three months old ( < 13.0 weeks ). The safety of maternal probiotic administration on neonatal growth pattern and gastrointestinal symptoms were also evaluated. Methods : In this randomized controlled trial, 41 infants completed the trial.. The infants were similar regarding gestational age, birth weight, gender, and crying time. The primary outcome measures were the percentage of children achieving a reduction in the daily average crying times ≥ 50 %, and the duration of crying ( minutes per day ). Infants fed probiotic formula  had similar growth to infants fed control formula.  Both formulas were well tolerated. The incidence of colic was low.. Infantile colic is typically defined as full-force crying for at least three hours per day..., and while not indicative of disease, may represent a serious underlying condition in a small percentage of infants who may need a medical assessment. Conclusion : Probiotics are live microorganisms that alter the microflora of the host and provide beneficial health effects. The most common probiotics used are of L. paracasei ssp. parasei and B. animalis ssp.. There is growing evidence to suggest that intestinal flora in colicky infants differ from those in healthy infants, and it is suggested that probiotics can redress this balance and provide a healthier intestinal microbiota l and scape. The low cost and easy availability of probiotics in preventing or reducing the incidence and prevalence of infantile colicky and.. ). "

The aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of a combined school-based intervention, developed by the Youth Sport Trust, on the temporal associations between these variables. Methods A total of 695 adolescents ( 11 - 15y ) from nine Dutch secondary schools participated in a one year cluster r and omised controlled trial ( RCT ). In the intervention schools, physical activity, ST, leaping activity, and throwing-catching skills were measured at baseline. The pre-specified primary outcome was  accelerometer assessed mean minutes of weekday moderate to vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) at time 2 ( 52 weeks are T0 baseline assessment s ). Secondary outcomes were mean count per minute ( cpm ), total PA and the percentage of body fat. Daily physical activity and sedentary behaviour were measured objective ly. The intervention consisted of seven physical activity promotion strategies that targeted the curriculum ( teaching strategies to increase physical activity in physical education lessons, student physical activity plans, and modification of school sport program ). No relation was found between study type ( intervention > control ) or age. In girls daily MVPA decreased from 7 - 9 years ( 1.70minutes/year ) ( p < 0.05 ). Linear mixed models, adjusted for sex, age, body mass index z-score, socioeconomic status, and baseline MVPA. In both age groups, the proportion accumulating an average of 60 min/d of MVPA did not differ between the 2 cohorts..

28060453," BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an additional 12-week treatment with varenicline versus a low-intensity treatment ( LIT ) for smoking cessation. We assessed the societal and health care perspective economic evaluation was based on the reported number of quitters at 12-month follow-up ( point prevalence ) from a r and omized controlled trial of smoking cessation programs in Sweden. We simulated the incidence of four smoking-related morbidities : lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease and stroke. The model computes quality -adjusted life-years ( QALYs ), from the perspective of the healthcare payer ( public and private ). We used previously published results in addition to hospital service and outpatient clinic cost data. The time horizon was 1 year, and we opted for a third-party payer perspective. RESULTS The incremental cost of treating smoking cessation amounted to US$ 2.58 per consultation by a smoker, translating into a cost per life-year saved by GP counselling with nicotine-patch treatment compared with only 12 weeks, were Euro 7066 for men and Euro 7108 for women. The number of cost-effective trials was estimated to be 1.0 - 107.1 in men and US$ 9.7 - 148.6 in women. CONCLUSIONS The model allowed for comparisons of up to five distinct smoking cessation interventions. In the current analyses, three interventions corresponding to the clinical trials were evaluated. Varenicline would save direct medical costs of Japanese Yen (¥)43 846 ( $ US381 ; $ US1= ¥ 115 ; Oct 2007 ) and generate an increase of 0.094 QALYs.

A prospective cohort study was undertaken to evaluate the relationship among a general measure of HRQL and outcomes in patients with COPD. The study compared the effect of a once-daily tiotropium 18 μg and placebo on HRQoL, spirometric parameters, and a control group receiving usual MCO care. RESULTS : One hundred patients ( 56 men ) with stable COPD, the  COPD -specific questionnaire ( SGRQ ), and the new 8-item Visual Simplified Respiratory Question naire ( 6MW ). Both patient groups had similar baseline characteristics. Patients received all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) at either a low dose ( LD ) or high dose ( HD ). Patients also completed the questionnaire. Mean ± SD baseline SGRQ total score was 47.4 ± 18.1. Patients who entered the program with poor quality of life were also assessed at the 7 week time point. Outcome measures were the Incremental Shuttle Walk Test, Perceived Health Status, and 6MWD. This was true for both the CRQ ( p = 0.0001 ),  the Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ) ; and two disease-specific tools. The correlation between the study outcomes was significant. Patient-reported outcome measures ( PROMs ) were observed to reflect outcomes relevant to patients. The PCS was independently predictive of death, hospitalization, and high outpatient utilization.

27163747," Introduction : Current research practice employs wide-ranging accelerometer wear time criteria to measure energy expenditure ( EE ) during military training. Twenty-four voluntary male conscripts participated in the study and wore an AR on the non-dominant wrist 24 h a day for 7 d. The AR analyzed and stored the frequency of h and movements ( f_h and ) into memory at 1 min intervals. The relationship between f _h and and EE was studied over a 7 d period of military treatment using the doubly labeled water ( DLW ) technique. In addition, the relationship between r and y of PAEE was analyzed during walking and running on a treadmill with an indirect calorimeter ( IC ). The highest correlation was found for the regression between Tracmor output and PAL ( r = 0.58 ). After correction for Tacmor values arising from vibrations produced by transportation means, this correlation was improved to 0.73. There was no difference between ATEE, PAEE, and PAL in discriminating between overall activity levels with "" low "" ( PAL < 1.60 ), "" moderate ( 1952–5724 cts/min ) and vigorous ( ≥5725 cts.min ).. The relative difference between methods ( accelerometer vs. DLW, a very high positive correlation and a low st and ard error of estimate ( SEE ) were observed between the AR and DLW techniques : for TEE, ACC+HRstep explained 76 and 64 % of TEE and PAEE from DLW. However, measurement of free-living AEE is usually not feasible in large-scale epidemiological studies but instead has traditionally been estimated based on self-reported physical activity."

31993718," Background : Despite national guidelines recommending bone mineral density screening with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) in women aged 65 years and older, many women do not receive initial screening. We developed a multi-component osteoporosis knowledge translation ( Op-KT ) tool involving a patient-initiated risk assessment question naire ( RAQ ), which generates individualized best practice recommendations for physicians and customized education for patients at the point of care.. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. The control group received the guidelines by mail ( r and omisation  to allocate units ( individuals or clusters of individuals ) to comparison groups. The tool was implemented using an intention-to-treat approach. Results : At inclusion, 74.3 % of patients ( n = 1480 ), patients in group 2 had mailed notification of their fracture, and 28.9 % in mailed reminder with physician prompt. Results Adjusted for differences at baseline indicated that mailed reminders significantly improved testing rates compared to usual care. The intervention group and the control group were significantly more likely to receive a DXA than UC ( 13.0%–24.1 % self-referral vs. 4.9%–5.6 % UC, P<0.05 ). The effect of CR+PtEd was confirmed by sensitivity analyses. This trial is registered with the International St and ard R and omised Controlled Trial registry, number of residents prescribed calcium and vitamin D, and number of patients wearing hip protectors. Conclusion : Osteoporosis ( OP ) is a major public health concern, but still OP care does not meet guidelines. The study showed that active identification of patients eligible for GIOP by pharmacists did not significantly increase the prescribing of bisphosphonates, but there was an increase in the overall OP care and characterize interventions taking into account elements related to their potential cost and feasibility."
24236629," BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is a very common cardiac arrhythmia with an increased mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation. The present study investigated the potential of the restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm with the use of amiodarone to treat patients with AF. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of amiodarone. In this multicentre r and omized controlled trial, a total of 261 patients ( age, 56 + /- 10 years ) with AF of duration > 48 h were enrolled. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for CHF, thromboembolic complications, bleeding, pacemaker implantation, and life-threatening drug side effects. The mean follow-up period was 21+/- 5 months, the patients were randomized to either amiodarone or to placebo. The median time to recurrence of AF was 23 days in the rhythm control group and 58 days for the rate-control patients ( P = 0.07 ). The main outcome was the proportion of patients with an AF, that is, the incidence of mortality. The secondary end points were all-cause mortality and the occurrence of heart failure.. The composite end point ( the percentage of patients free from AF ) was 29 % in both BB and S group. The numbers of patients who developed recurrent AF ( 6 % ) or atrial tachycardia ( 3 % ). There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups. The incidence of cardiac death ( CV ) among the dronedarone group and 139 ( 6.0 % ) in those treated with placebo group (. The mortality rate, through a systematic review, was 1.34 % vs 17.1 %, H 82.9 % vs 26.8 %,. There was 1 transient ischemic attack and 1 late death in both groups. and.).A"

A prospect i ve study evaluated the diagnostic utility of clinicians trained in flexion-distraction technique  to determine the presence of trigger points in the lumbar spine of patients with low back pain. Objective. To calculate the intertester reliability of a classification system, and to compare initial patient characteristics and outcomes of physical therapy treatment when a classification approach is used. RESULTS Reliability of the McKenzie approach for determining diagnostic categories is unclear. Previous studies have been characterized by inconsistency of test protocol s, criterion measures, and level of training. The therapists were trained by the same authors.. The interrater reliability was calculated for each type of physical examination. The study included 18 volunteers, mean age 40 years ( range, 24–55 years ), were blindly assessed by two examiners. The kappa value for the two-step process of lateral shift assessment was. The percentage of agreement was 67 %. The criteria'jump sign'and'recognition ', on the condition that localized tenderness is present. The results of this study indicate that intrarater reliability was greater than interexaminer reliability. For intraexaminer reliability there was considerable variation by segment and among the four examiners, but the kappa value was > or =.75. The majority of patients were found to have a positive response to the examination. The validity of these findings was determined to be high. The role of two types of examination procedures used in this systematic review was to assess the reliability of different types and the validity of clinical examinations."
22899657," BACKGROUND To compare the effect of laparoscopic surgery for abdominal pain. We have evaluated this study to evaluate whether suture of the peritoneal layer is necessary as a separate step in the closure of midline abdominal surgical wounds. The study was conducted in a clinical university center, the Sahlgrens Hospital. All 206 patients undergoing laparotomy for the removal of adhesions, were included. In the study, the patients were assessed by two groups of 16 patients each ( groups A and B ). Among these patients, two patients were operated on by laparoscopy, and 21 patients underwent the same operation. The postoperative wound dehiscence in group A and group B was observed in 2 and 11 cases respectively ( p < 0.001 ). There was no significant difference in narcotic requirements, transfusion rate, post-operative infectious and non-infectious complications, and total hospital stay were also similar. After six courses of PAC ( cisplatin 50 mg/m(2 ), Adriamycin 50 mg @ ), and surgical technique.. The mean hospital stay in group 1 than in group 2 was 12.4 days and 16.8 days respectively ( P =.23 ). Conclusion There was a significant correlation between the salpingoscopic grade and the occurrence of a term pregnancy. The use of sutures on ovaries treated for endometrioma is associated with a lower rate of postoperative adhesion formation than after salpingotomy with tubal suturing.. Using a'good surgical approach', the most common complication following treatment of small bowel obstruction, acquired infertility and inadvertent organ injury at reoperation.

21342080," The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ), in the treatment of panic disorder.. Twenty-five out patients with panic disorder ( PD ) were r and omly selected. The diagnosis was obtained using the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV. All twenty-four subjects were randomized to treatment with either sertraline, in daily doses of 50 to 100 mg, or placebo. The principal measure of efficacy was the number of panic attacks, obtained from the Sheehan Panic and Anticipatory Anxiety Scale. In the first 8 weeks of treatment ( acute phase ), the respiratory subtype group had a significantly faster response to citalopram, than placebo. At the end of the study, 63 % and 53 % of paroxetine group ( PC-D ), respectively, were panic-free during the final 2 weeks ( p <.005 ; odds ratio [ OR ] = 1.63.. The efficacy of citalopram was superior to placebo, this first prospect i ve study was statistically significantly improved ( p =.04 ), and the increase in percentage of patients with zero panic attacks reached borderline significance (. ). The majority of patients treated with the combination of pindolol and fluoxetine ( P = 0.02 ) had a significant psychosocial impairment and a high risk of psychiatric comorbidities and suicide.. Treatment of PD should be treated effectively as soon as the symptoms emerge because the longer these patients remain without treatment. SSRI and SNRIs are the better the prognosis. The more rapid the improvement of PD, SSRI, and SSRI-treated patients should be compared with placebo. SPRIs and SSRVs are effective and well tolerated. and.-)."

In delivering the presence of the book concept, you can find out the boo site here--BACKGROUND: CONTEXT While the main focus of a meta- analysis is often to identify the effectiveness of a particular intervention in managing or curing a specific condition, there exists a substantial amount of information within published systematic review s that could be used to assessed the validity of a generic hypothesis about the efficacy of an intervention across a range of different but related conditions. To assess these results, systematic ally search for and then collate the results of meta-analyses for the effective of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing postoperative wound infection across various types of surgery in order to assesses generic hypotheses about their effectiveness of this intervention in surgery as a whole. With the relative risk of wound infection used as the measure of clinical effectiveness, the hypotheses to be assessed were first that antibiotic prophylaxis would be an effective intervention for preventing wound infection over a broad range of various surgical procedures..."
16009415," OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of a resin-modified glass ionomer and a resin composite in the restoration of non-carious cervical lesions. A total of 197 class V restorations ( n=197 ) were placed in caries-free cervical erosion/abfraction lesions without tooth preparation. One of each pair was cured using "" soft-start "" polymerization, while the other was polymerized with high-intensity halogen light. The cavities were clinical ly evaluated at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months using modified Ryge/USPHS criteria. The teeth were assigned on a r and om basis to four groups for restoration with either a composite ( group 1 : n=36 ; Tetric, Vivadent ), or a polyacid-modified resin composite ( Group 2 : n =79 ; Dyract, Dentsply ). The difference in retention rates was not statistically significant. The restoration retention in function of time was recorded in order to find out if adhesives with a simplified application procedure are as clinical ly effective as conventional three-step adhesive. The restorations were evaluated by a single-blind design, according to a modified USPHS system. The retention rate for Vitremer ( 93 % ) and for Dyract ( 78.5 % ) did not differ significantly ( p > 0.05 ). Regarding anatomical form, only two restorations of each material were recorded as bravo. In terms of marginal adaptation, the post-operative sensitivity, marginal discoloration and secondary caries were not affected by enamel beveling and restorative material. Beveled enamel margins result in significantly better clinical retention than the rest of the restorations. The best clinical performance was observed for the adhesive resin layer when used in cervical cavities."
28089943," The search for complementary treatments in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) is a high-priority challenge. Grape and wine polyphenol resveratrol confers CV benefits, in part by exerting anti-inflammatory effects. We determined the extent to which the resveratrol supplementation at two different dosages ( 500 and 40mg/day ) for 6 months i ) reduced the concentrations of C-reactive-protein ( CRP ) and ii ) ameliorated the metabolic pattern of T2DM patients.  In the present double-blind, r and omized, placebo-controlled trial, 192 T1DM patients were r and Omized to receive resveratrol 500 mg/day ( R&O ) or a placebo , placebo or placebo for 6-months. During each visit, 266 men subsequently developed nonfatal MI or fatal coronary heart disease. At baseline and at the trial end, CRP values, anthropometric, metabolic and liver parameters were determined. No serious adverse event occurred. A dose-dependent, though not significant, CRP decrease of 5.6 % ( Rv40arm ) and 15.9 % ( Resv500arm ) was observed vs placebo. We failed to detect significant differences in weight, BMI, waist circumference, and values of arterial blood pressure, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, insulin, C-peptide ( -16.8 %, p = 0.01 ), the difference in adiponectin was not significant ( p=0.10 ). Age-adjusted incident CVD was associated with plasma leptin, adipocectin and the L/A ratio ( p =0.045 to p= 0.001 ). The results of human clinical trials have revealed that the effects of resveratrol on adipokines are inconsistent."

The aim of this study was to compare the role of patient education, accelerated rehabilitation, and the size of the incision through a st and ard approach. A consecutive series of 70 patients who underwent primary bilateral simultaneous total knee arthroplasties was studied. The initial item pool contained all items from existing criteria lists. Subsequently, the same implants ( Trilogy cup, MAYO stem ) were evaluated prospect ively. The average operation time was almost the similar ; The average length of incision for group 1 was 7.9 cm ( 7.4 - 9.0 cm ) and 16.3 cm ( 14 - 22 cm ). The demographic data, including sex, age, height, weight, BMI, diagnosis and preoperative Harris hip score were recorded. The postoperative course was uneventful. The surgical time and postoperative complications. The mean postoperative hospital stay was less than 6 months ( mean : 8.5 months ). There was no difference in estimated blood loss, mean operative time, transfusion needs, or complications among the groups. CONCLUSIONS Mini-incision total joint replacement continues the current trend in orthopaedics and other specialties toward smaller-incision surgery. The main difference was the average postoperative time, the acetabular and stem position, and postoperative recovery. The clinical and radiographic outcomes were comparable between the two groups. The authors believe that using a smaller posterolateral incision as was done to the minimally invasive procedure."

One non-pharmacological intervention that has shown promising results in reducing the duration of postoperative ileus, the authors investigated the feasibility of preoperative nutritional support. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic octreotide to reduce the incidence of pancreatic fistula, postoperative complications, morbidity and hospital stay in patients undergoing pancreatic surgery. Methods : Patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy ad modum whipple due to pancreatic or ileal cancer. This study was conducted as a phase III trial that was terminated early. The primary outcome was time to resumption of adequate oral intake.  Patients were now, six years later, analyzed as a single prospect i ve cohort and compared with the control group. The incidence of positive intraoperative bile cultures was significantly higher in the internal-PBD ( 85 % ) and external-PBD.. The rates of clinical ly significant pancreatic fistulae ( grade s B and C ) were 10.9 and 18.5 % ( p = ns ), and morbidity was 18 and 29.6 %, respectively. The increases in heat transfer across anterior portions of the skin surface were similar with each warming system ( approximately 65 % ). The length of hospital stay was reduced through the use of octreotide, though there was a trend towards fewer incidences of complications.. These factors, together with soft pancreatic parenchyma and certain disease pathologies, did not show a statistically significant difference between groups. The postoperative recovery after surgery ( ERAS ) pathways are now implemented worldwide with strong evidence that adhesion to such protocol reduces medical complications than forced air, especially during the first published guidelines. This concept has been applied for pancreatic Surgery since the best available evidence and on expert consensus."

The vitamin D receptor gene is a well-studied c and i date gene for osteoporosis. We investigated the association between leg press peak power and leg extensor strength. Functional performance outcomes included : 6-minute walk distance, Short Physical Performance Battery, Physical Performance Test, and Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey. RESULTS Peak power improved 22 % ( p =.004 ) in the power group ( 6 % ) and muscle power.. Muscle power was determined by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to estimate specific strength and specific PP. In women, there were six significant relationships for grip ( 15 + /- 9 % ), and leg power ( 14 + /-.9 % ).. The greater number of relationships between grip strength and ageing markers was not explained by the increase in muscle strength ( OR=30.35 ; 95 % CI, 5.48 - 168.09 ),.. Changes in chest-press strength ( estimated mean difference, 16.3 N ) and leg strength were compared, demonstrating that muscle power was significantly greater in older people than chronological age.. Conclusion Muscle power has been proposed to be the primary therapeutic target for older adults throughout the literature.. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies evaluating muscle power exerted by older people in resistance exercises through May 2017."

23334071," To determine whether nicotine dependence, classified by level of severity, was associated with other substance dependence, major depression, and anxiety disorders. This study evaluated if males and females differ in the antidepressant response magnitude following scopolamine administration. A total of 52 male and female out patients meeting criteria for recurrent major depressive or bipolar disorder participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Following a single-blind placebo session, participants r and omly received P/S or S/P ( P=3 placebo ; S=3 scopolamine ( 4μg/kg ) sessions ). Mood-state self-ratings ( Profile of Mood State ( POMS ) and Visual Analog Scales ( VAS ) ) and depression severity ( Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) ) were obtained before each infusion. These results suggest that elderly depressed patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment seem to be more similar to previously studied elderly controls rather than to patients with Alzheimer's disease in their reaction to short-term cholinergic blockade. The discriminant analysis significantly separated responders from non-responders in both the unipolar and bipolar diagnostic subgroups. The Discriminant functions accurately classified over 85 % of patients as responders/non-respondors. The POMS depression subscale significantly correlated with clinical response, as did the VAS restlessness, sad, and irritated scales. The results indicate that the clinical response following scopolamine is a central ly acting competitive inhibitor of the muscarinic cholinergic receptor site. This review seeks to find all available data investigating scopolamine as an antidepressant."

Twenty-seven single rooted maxillary anterior teeth in 18 patients ( nine males and nine females ; age range 18 - 60 years ) were restored either with a CFRC post or a wrought precious alloy control. Cast type III gold alloy cores were used in conjunction with both post groups. The CRFC posts ( n = 16 ) were primarily stratified based on the remaining tissue available to restore the tooth core with or without a post. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze clinical trials and cohort studies that evaluated the incidence rate of root fractures in post-retained restorations. RESULTS One post and core in group 2 was functioning well 58 months after placement when the patient died. The composite core build-ups were prepared ensuring a circumferential 2-mm ferrule. The primary endpoint was a loss of restoration for any reason. To study group differences, the log-rank test was calculated ( P <.05 ). Hazard plots were constructed. The final treatment result for 46 of the 49 remaining posts ( 30 patients ) was successful. The overall failure rate was 6 %. The incidence rate for root fractures was higher than the other groups.. The survival rate for the coronal tooth structure was 97.1 %. Absolute failures consisted of two root fractures and one endodontic failure, while relative failures were 100 % for dual-cure composite and 96.8 % for hybrid light-cure resin. The probability of no failure was comparable for both post material s ( risk ratio ; 95 % confidence interval, 0.965 - 0.851/1.095 )."
26342482," BACKGROUND Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective form of obesity management for those whose BMI is greater than 40 ( or 35 with co morbidities ). The role of this study was to evaluate the impact of weight loss in these patients after surgery. The feasibility of an HVEP in obese post-bariatric-surgery patients was determined by r and omized to a waitlist control group and a Control group. Patients ( n = 162 ) were recruited immediately prior to surgery and omly assigned to either a control group or a group to receive either a weight loss program ( p = 0.001 ) or the BRS. The study was performed at an academic medical center. The patients were followed prospectively. The weight loss was determined at 12 months ( 82 % women ; mean BMI, 45.9 ; 95 % CI, 31.2 - 60.6 ). A cohort of 10 patients excluded for logistical issues were enrolled as a  control group. During the training period, patients were su bmi tted to biometrical, sport performance, cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and psychiatric evaluations. RESULTS The patients who received dietary counseling achieved greater weight loss than those who received st and ard. The initial body mass index was lower and the follow-up period was longer ( BMI 29.3 to 27.1 ). For the patients who underwent surgery, the weight loss ( BMI < 30 kg/m(2 ) ) was the only significant difference between the 2 groups. The surgery group had lower 2- and 10-year incidence rates of diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and global health scales ( P < 0.05 ).

The treatment group received an intervention design ed to reduce the incidence, time lost and cost due to the back injuries.. The intervention group received a set of exercises and an educational component stressing the ergonomic aspect, and the other half ( trained group ) received a curriculum of instruction totaling 40 hours. The data were collected from two hospitals. The patients completed a face-to-face baseline interview, which was followed-up by a telephone interview. The main study measures were demographic characteristics, work activities, the Zung depression scale.  Anthropometric factors were quantified using the two study designs. The average compression was significantly different during different periods of the day ( p < 0.001 ) with highest compression during pre-breakfast when CAs assist most with activities of daily living. Significant differences were found in average compression between low and high injury rates.  The data included work factors ( both psychological stress and patient h and ling activities related to work ). Though back pain was Independent of patient-h and ling skill, those rated as “ bad ” or “ poor ” had more back injuries ( 24 % ) than those who had been rated as "" good ” and “ excellent ” ( 2 % ). The reasons for the lack of use of mechanical lifts were more than offset by the savings in total tasks observed in the CAs. This systematic review was conducted to ascertain whether this much-documented association constitutes a causal relationship, and whether there is a discernible threshold of exposures associated with this elevated risk."

The experimental pain studies were assessed using a temporal summation test ( tonic heat pain evoked by a Peltier thermode ). The analgesic properties of cannabinoids remain unclear. Objective To conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis of the association between cannabinoid drug administration and experimental pain outcomes. The method ological quality was high in four and moderate in six SRs. There were inconsistent findings of four SRs on the efficacy of cannabis-based medicines in neuropathic pain, and of one SR for painful spasms in multiple sclerosis.. The majority of studies were observational. The efficacy of cannabinoids, there was no effect on capsaicin-induced pain at any dose.. For the pharmacokinetic profiling, blood sample s were collected... Although cannabinoid drugs are widely used as analgesics, a significant increase in pain was observed. In the cold and heat tests, we observed that cannabinoids could not significantly attenuate either ongoing pain or as an adjunct to cannabinoid analgesia. Compared with placebo, marijuana and dronabinol decreased pain sensitivity ( 3.56 % ; 6 h ) and increased pain tolerance ( 1.98 % ; 20 mg ). Additionally, at the highest dose ( 1 mg ), and only for women, nabilone significantly ( p = 0.003 ) dampened the incidence of allodynia and hyperalgesia. The pain of cannabinoids in the present study and a larger sample of subjects might have provided more robust evidence of their efficacy in.A)."
25427435," OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of sulfasalazine ( SSZ ) on inflammatory back pain ( AS ) in patients with ankylosing spondylitis and chronic intestinal inflammation. METHODS Forty patients with active AS. The treatment group showed significant improvement in pain, stiffness, sleep disturbance ( p<0.05 ), finger/floor distance, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, orosomucoid and IgA levels. The side effects were mild. The primary end points of this study were the improvements in patient and physician global assessment s of disease activity. The overall assessment of treatment efficacy was made by both patients and observers at the end of the study period. A sample from the US general population and patients with other medical conditions derived the same parameters.. The response rates were significantly higher during acute attacks in group 2 ( group 1 : 31.3 ± 26.4 × 10−4 min−1 vs group 2 : 66.2 ± 28.5 mg/day ). The mean ( SD ) BASDAI dropped markedly in both groups. In the majority of patients, clinical and laboratory improvements were observed in the treatment of AS... Patients and observers reported a favorable outcome after treatment with SSZ or placebo.. This is an up date of a Cochrane review first published in 2005. BACKGROUND To evaluate the benefits and harms of sulfasalazine for treating AS, and the role of sulfasalazine. The number of patients with severe persistent posterior synechiae.. Treatment with sulfasalazine is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause and affects mainly the spine, but can also affect other joints. This effect is more pronounced in those with AS, the disease progression may result in loss of mobility and function. KEY POINTS: This is a study of a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug used in treating patients with AS. This study was supported by the Cochrane review of a randomized controlled trial of sulfasalazine.A.."
22506694," BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Assessment of the quality of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) is common practice in systematic review. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of  magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) findings in the lumbar spine among persons without current low back pain or sciatica and to examine which findings are related to age or previous back symptoms. Summary of Background Information. The initial item pool contained all items from existing criteria lists. Subsequently, we reduced the number of items by using the Delphi consensus technique. Each Delphi round comprised a question naire, an analysis, and a feedback report. The  PEDro scale item hierarchy was the same in both sample s.. The majority of subjects volunteered to sit for 30 min on an exercise ball and on a wooden stool.  Muscle activity and spine position were used to model spine load and stability. An additional seven sat on the two dynamic chairs.  There were 123 subjects ( 83 % ) with moderate to severe desiccation of one or more discs.  Trunk kinematics ( LBP ) and /or low back discomfort ( LBD ) while sitting. This systematic review investigated the effect of dynamic sitting on LBP or LBD. This is a result of : the failure of simplistic single-dimensional therapies to show large effects in patients with LBP and the development of LBD. The results of clinical trials testing commonly prescribed interventions demonstrating that no management approaches are clearly superior5–7 9 ; 3. the stories of NSCLBP patients relating their own ongoing pain experiences of multiple failed treatments, conflicting diagnoses, lost hope and ongoing suffering.... Dynamic sitting has been proposed to reduce low back pain, LBP among subjects with LBP, and/or LBP among pain-free subjects."

Methods A multi-level intervention was tested in a cluster r and omized trial among 782 employees in 12 central Massachusetts public high schools from 2009 to 2012. The intervention targeted the nutrition and physical activity environment and policies, the social environment and individual knowledge, and finally, the intervention was compared to a control conditions.. Within- and between-groups changes in mean BMI, and in the percentage of overweight or obese employees were examined in a volunteer sample. Mixed model estimates from cross-sectional and cohort sample s were pooled with weights inverse to the variance of the baseline. Primary outcomes were meeting the guidelines for PA and positive thoughts indicating behavioral intention. Results The intervention group had increased weight, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1c levels. Direct and indirect costs were calculated from a societal perspective.. As adults spend most of their weekdays at work, their BMI and waist circumference increased significantly. The majority of intervention participants were successfully implemented by all intervention schools, although establishing formal policies was challenging. The rates of smoking cessation and cancer screening did not differ between study groups. Conclusion The intervention was a successful model for achieving certain health behavior changes among adults. At higher weights, more than 15 % of participants were able to complete the program. The impact they have on employees'body composition.. Although the study was not powered, worksite wellness programs may include topics of nutrition education and physical exercise to improve an employee's body composition, they are inconsistent with the impact that they may have on participants'body constitution.. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the impacts of worksite nutrition nutrition interventions on employees' body composition.. As adolescents and adults spend the majority of times at work, their nutrition nutrition, they should be encouraged to andA.)."
22090798," BACKGROUND Although they found in an earlier study that inositol, an important intracellular second-messenger precursor, was effective against panic disorder, this population was studied using a small therapeutic study. In this study, the authors investigated the effectiveness and tolerability of citalopram, an antidepressant, in the treatment of panic disorder. In a r and omized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 40 patients with panic disorder were treated with three sessions of exposure therapy using virtual reality exposure to heights. The outcomes of the study were assessed.. The frequency and severity of panic attacks and the severity of agoraphobia. The authors found that the patients received placebo... Patients increased their body sway during the intervention, whereas controls did not ;  The two groups were combined to the same extent. The treatment with citalopram there was a significantly greater reduction in panic attacks ( p = 0.0001 ) and those on placebo ( N = 11 ). The results showed that a greater effect of placebo on panic attacks than on the other two outcomes. The efficacy of escitalopram was similar to placebo. The majority of patients had no significant difference between the 2 treatments. The study was well recognized and that patients with agoraphobia, particularly when the diagnosis was difficult.. To better clarify the role of citalopram. The effect of citalopram on spontaneous panic attacks.. treatment was associated with improvement on all assessed domains that impair quality of life. This study concluded that although there are controversial issues ( the "" American view ) of this syndrome, the clinical trials available from 2000, they are well recognized that may improve this complex syndrome.

26567234," Background : To assess the effectiveness of a secondary prevention programme to improve the lifestyle in patients with coronary heart disease. Methods and Results : The Young at Heart multicenter trial compared usual care with that achieved after referral by the primary care team to a commercial rehabilitation programme. The primary outcome was the rate of cardiovascular disease risk reduction.. The intervention group received a behavioral program based on self-efficacy theory in the home 2 weeks after discharge with regular follow-up. The control group received routine medical care.. Primary outcome measures Components of secondary prevention assessed at baseline and 1 year after discharge were : aspirin use ; blood pressure management ; lipid management ; physical activity ; dietary fat ; and smoking status. A total of 525 patients ( 7.0 % ) died, and 492 patients ( 82 % ) accumulated 2397 all-cause hospitalizations associated with 10 258 hospital days. Secondary outcomes included Framingham Coronary Risk Score at 12 months, in addition to changes in individual risk factors. RESULTS : There were significant improvements in six of eight health status domains ( all functioning scales, pain, and general health ) among patients attending the intervention group. The majority of the patients achieved the diagnostic criteria for myocardial infa rct ion, with no new smokers, and ‘ good ’ if 7 to 9 were on target. There were similar trends with respect to all hospitalizations ( 1197 versus 1200 ; P=0.802 ), and the proportion of patients who completed the programme was 3.27 %. The adjusted mean improvement attributable to intervention was 0.55, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.27 to 0.86 ). The commercial programmes achieved significantly greater weight loss than did the usual care.

27871122," BACKGROUND The optimal ablation technique for persistent and long-st and ing persistent atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is unclear. Both linear lesion ( LL ) and ganglionated plexus ( GP ) ablation have been used in addition to antiarrhythmic drugs. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of these 2 treatment strategies in patients with paroxysmal AF. Methods and Results : Patients with persistent AF, symptomatic HF, and LV ejection fraction < 50 % were r and omized to catheter ablation ( PVAI, group 2, n = 48 ) or to a hybrid strategy combining ablation of complex fractionated or rapid atrial electrograms ( CFAE ). The primary endpoint at 12-month follow-up was defined as any episode of AF or atrial flutter lasting > 24 h that occurred after a 3-month blanking period. Between October 2010 and May 2011, 1410 patients were included and 1391 underwent an AFib ablation ( 98.7 % ). At 24 months, AF burden was significantly lower in the RFA ( n=110 ) than in  the control group ( P=0.001 ). After a second procedure, the long-term overall success rate without thromboembolism ( 3.3 % in Group A vs 0 % in group B, P = 0.058 ).. The acute endpoint ( AF termination or consistent slowing ) was achieved in 86 % of the patients treated with PVI, 27 % of patients ( 61 % ) and 5 patients ( 9 % ) were in sinus rhythm after 1 year of ablation. The AF terminated during ablation, either by conversion to normal or by persistent AF. The optimal rhythm management strategy for people with non-paroxysmal ( persistent or long-d and ing stable ) atrial fibrilation is currently not well defined. The efficacy and safety of ablation ( catheter and surgical ) has emerged as an alternative to the use of ablation in  persistent or late-st or ing persistent ).

27834223," BACKGROUND To investigate the effectiveness of a counseling and support intervention for older adults. The objective of this study was to determine whether a family meetings intervention was superior to usual care in postponing nursing home placement of patients with dementia. The study design was a randomized controlled trial. The caregivers were r and omized to the intervention group or a control group that attended normal activities. We further compared the variance in health impact of individual and area level social capital. A total of 235 older adults ( > 74 years ) suffering from dementia participated. The intervention was implemented in 15 groups ( each with 7 - 8 participants and 2 professional group leaders ) meeting for 3 months altogether 12 times. The primary outcome measure was the time until institutionalization of the patient. The trial simultaneously tested the individual and combined effects of intervention and the number of reported illnesses. In this pilot trial, physical, cognitive, and social activity increased. Although qualitatively derived benefits differed across groups, we aim to assess the potential for social capital interventions targeting older adults."
24188134," OBJECTIVES To investigate the effect of alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist naftopidil on the quality of life ( QOL ) in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms ( LUTS ) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ). Methods : A total of 56 patients with BPH/BPH who had an International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS ) of 8 or more were enrolled. All underwent pre-treatment documentation of tamsulosin ( 50 mg/day, n = 48 ) or tazosin ( 0.2 mg /day,n = 47 ). Before and 12 weeks after treatment, a question naire was used to evaluate ejaculation. The therapeutic effects were compared in a crossover design. Results : The proportion of patients with nocturia was significantly lower than the control group. The mean values of the IPSS total score, IPSS-QoL and BPH impact index ( BII ) were significantly improved. When dividing the patients into two groups, the mean score and the QOL score were significantly higher ( p = 0.013 ). The overall prevalence of UTS was 2.0 % ( 10/511 patients ).. The improvement in the Q(max ) was significantly better for the cotherapy group ( 45.0 mL ) than for those with a PV of < 35 ml. The efficacy of this study was to systematic ally review the effects of treatment with the adrenoreceptor A1D antagonist naftsopidil in treating BPH. The incidence of total I-PSS, maximum urinary flow rate, post-void residual urine volume ( PVR ), and almost all domains in KHQ. Conclusion : The administration of α1-blocker to patients with bladder outlet obstruction and/or the presence of urinary retention may be helpful for treating the lower urinary sphincter symptoms ( SUTS ), although the efficacy of 1.0 mg to the majority of."
19888792," BACKGROUND The second Primary Angioplasty in Myocardial Infa rct ion ( PAMI-II ) study evaluated the effectiveness of a treatment of patients with multivessel coronary disease. The first treatment is the insertion of a chest tube ( ICT ), and the second is to a great number of patients there is recurrence of the disease..  Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were compared to treat moderate to severe CAP, the time to give the vaccine, and lost productivity due to adverse reactions.. The primary clinical end point was freedom from major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events at one year. The costs of hospital re sources used were also determined.. At 1 year, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of death, readmission, or myocardial infa rict ion.. Hypothermia was significantly less common in KMC infants in Merida ( 13.5 vs 31.5 episodes/100 infants/d ) and overall ( 10.8 vs 14.6 ). The cost-benefit ratio was 1:2.47. The patients who received accelerated care had similar in-hospital outcomes but were discharged 3 days earlier ( 4.2+/-2.3 vs. 7.1+/-4.7 days, p = 0.0001 ) and had lower hospital costs ( $ 9,658 ( 95 % CI 5.22, 2.12 ). Cost of hospitalization was lower in the group. The acquisition and administration costs were lower for the intervention group than for those assigned to bypass surgery. The study suggests that providing an influenza vaccination programme can incur a substantial net benefit for an employer. HEEs, as context -specific tools, are not easily generalizable from setting to setting. The strategy of stenting was less than in developing countries. The health economic evaluations ( HEE) conducted in LAC are generalizable to LAC ( trans-regional ) and to other LAC countries."

15626993," STUDY DESIGN A prospect i ve cohort study of the responsiveness of two clinical and question naire data obtained from the Maine Lumbar Spine Study. The results of previous studies are contradictory and there is a lack of longitudinal data on the effects of long term therapeutic exercise on patients with low back pain. OBJECTIVE : To investigate the relationships among the severity of epidural fibrosis, psychological factors, back pain and disability after lumbar disc surgery. BACKGROUND DATA Evaluation of treatment outcome is being determined more frequently from a patient's perspective. The study was conducted on 720 patients, who sought care for back pain in primary care setting s of a large health maintenance organization.. The relation between the opto‐electric device, the question naires, and work status in patients with back pain was evaluated. The main outcomes studied were fear-avoidance beliefs about physical activity, beliefs about the inevitable consequences of back trouble, and JVB pain. The minimal clinical ly important difference was estimated with patient global assessment. The Oswestry Disability Index was used to calculate the functional status and the visual analog scale. The treatment of choice for chiropractors was spinal manipulation and physical therapy modalities. Responsiveness was evaluated using ROC curve analysis and effect size calculations. The patients demonstrated a significant decrease in pain, functional limitations, and a high percentage of respondents score zero. The specific and generic measures showed similar levels of cross-sectional validity. The clinical findings showed that the scale scores were significantly related to work status, but the follow-up scores were not.

22160462," BACKGROUND To establish the feasibility and effectiveness of a protocol for osteoporosis treatment following fractures, we previously demonstrated that a hospital-based case manager could increase rates of appropriate fracture treatment in the elderly. We developed a multifaceted intervention directed at older patients with fragility fractures, treatment guidelines endorsed by opinion leaders, and patient education. We undertook a 6-month follow-up study of patients with hip fracture. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had been treated with a primary care physician. The secondary outcomes included the number of patients receiving treatment and the incidence of fractures.. The retrospective study was conducted to determine the relationship between fracture type and treatment. From a third-party health care payer perspective, the percentage of patients that had complied with the protocol ( n = 887 ). The intervention consisted to the patients who refused to participate and 20 % who were unable to cooperate. The median age of the cohort was 69 years. The majority of patients ( 58 % ) were included. The percentage of compliance increased from 8.2 to 57.2 % ( P <.01 ). In this study, there were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups. The average age in each group was 78 years, with twenty-five patients ( 29 % ) and three patients ( 4 % ) of them. The intervention group received the following: treatment for bone mineral density, and 6 % ( n=28 ) were receiving the study protocol. The study showed that using a case manager for patients with fracture compared with usual care.. We found that treatment with a protocol alone significantly increased the rate of treatment at six months after the fracture... This study suggests that an information-based intervention led to a higher rate of osteoporotic fractures than did usual care aloneOCA+R-/.). ."
23539309," OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of a supervised exercise program compared with a home-based exercise program in patients with intermittent claudication.. Methods and Results Seventeen patients with a typical history of peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) were r and omized to either an individual leg exercise training group ( TG ) training 4 × 4 min intervals at 80 % of maximal work rate three times per week for 8 weeks. The study was conducted in a Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital with 32 patients. The exercise programs consisted of intermittent walking to nearly maximal claudicated pain for 12 weeks. Patients were studied at baseline, 6 months, and 18 months during the study. Primary outcome measures included claudicating distance ( ICD ) and absolute claudications distance ( ACD ), the treadmill walking speed, and the walking ability. The quality of reporting of those that are published is often inadequate. In this article, we present an adapted CONSORT checklist  for reporting noninferiority and equivalence trials and provide illustrative examples and explanations for those items amended from the original study. RESULTS Both training programs significantly improved the maximum walking distance ( P < 0.05 ), but greater improvements were seen in the control group ( P = NS ), and were significantly greater than the level of walking performance. The changes in gait speed and ACD were similar between the 2 exercise groups ( P >.05 ). The activities of Cyt-ox and CS decreased with operation, but the activity of the Vitalog was further augmented with training in group 3. Conclusion The 12-month structured exercise program had no significant effect on physical fitness or performance-based tests of function and whether improvement in walking ability is related to an improvement in these outcomes.

To test the presumption of equivalence in humans, we compared the effect of vitamin D status, measured as serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25(OH)D ), and the incidence of falls in older women with the same diagnosis. We conducted a 1-year population -based, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of postmenopausal women with normal bone density, who were given oral vitamin D3. Over a median follow-up time of 7 years, there was no significant difference in the mean change over time in systolic blood pressure ( 0.22 mm Hg ; 95 % CI : −0.05 to 0.49 mm Hg ). In the study, participants were r and omized to receive 500 000 IU vitamin D(3 ) ( cholecalciferol ), or placebo. The outcomes were compared between the two groups at 1 week, 1 month, or 6 months of treatment. The mean change in serum vitamin D concentration was not significantly different.

29941852," BACKGROUND : Postoperative insulin resistance is a well-characterized metabolic state that has been shown to correlate with the length of postoperative stay in hospital. We investigated the effects of a carbohydrate drink, a leucine metabolite, on postoperative insulin resistance. We aim to investigate the effect of a multimodal protocol ( ACERTO protocol ) plus preoperative immune nutrition on the postoperative recovery of total hip replacement ( THR ) and total knee replacement ( TKR ). Methods Thirty-two patients ( mean age, 58 years ; range, 26–85 years ; 16 males ) were r and omized to receive either the  ACER TO protocol  ( n = 15 ) or the group that consumed placebo before surgery. The nutritional supplementation consisted of an iso-osmolar carbohydrate-rich drink ( 12.5 g carbohydrates/100 ml, pH 5.0 ). Fasting blood sample s were collected before surgery and repeated after 5 days and after 2 months. IGF-I and IGFBP-1 were determined in serum by RIA. Body composition was determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ). The two groups followed the same protocol. The mean difference in insulin sensitivity was 1.1 ± 3.6 % change from baseline to 2 weeks after surgery. There were no significant differences in total lean body mass ( LBM ) ( 2.05 ± 0.66 kg ; p = 0.036 ) and a -18.4 ± 2.3 % change in the CHO-H group ( -16 %, p = NS ). During clamps performed 24h postoperatively, insulin sensitivity and whole-body glucose disposal was reduced in both groups. The pre-operative intake of a 200–200x2 ml carbohydrate drink had no statistically significant effect on glucose clearance, insulin sensitivity, postoperative complications, or wellbeing in patients undergoing THR and TKR."
30684171," Objective : To examine the effect of an equivalent weight loss, by gastric bypass ( RYGB )  compared to gastric b and ing ( GB ) surgery. Background : Reports on long-term results of RYGBP are scarce and focus primarily on weight loss. Our aim is to compare the possible involvement of ghrelin in the pathogenesis of human obesity, we measured body weight, appetite, fasting, and postpr and ial ghrelin and peptide-YY ( PYY ) levels. Methods : All patients who underwent a primary RYGBP for morbid obesity in our 2 hospitals between 1999 and August 2008 were included.  Patients were reevaluated on the 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 12th postoperative month. Blood sample s were collected after an overnight fast and in 6 patients in each group after a st and ard 420 kcal mixed meal. Results : Body weight and body mass index ( BMI ) decreased markedly ( P < 0.0001 ) and comparably after either procedure. At T2, weight loss was greater after GBP than GB ( P = 0.003 ). GLP-1, PYY, and amylin levels did not significantly change from T1 to T2 ; leptin levels continued to decrease after RYGB, but not after GB at T2. Surprisingly, ghrelin area under the curve ( AUC ) increased 1 year after RYGB.. All comorbidities improved significantly compared with baseline ( P ≤ 0.001 ) and did not decrease significantly after the test meal. Quality of life also improved markedly, and more than 95 % of the patients had a good to excellent 5-year overall result according to the BAROS score. This systematic review and meta- analysis aim ed to investigate changes of fasting total ghrelin following RYGB."

29857555," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the dose effect of breast milk on the incidence of preterm infants with the risk of late-onset sepsis ( VLBW ). We tested the hypothesis that fortified breast milk, fed alone or with preterm formula, would improve early postnatal growth in preterm infants. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of maternal milk on preterm infants who received a preterm formula or unfortified donor breast milk as sole diets or as supplements to their mothers'expressed milk. RESULTS : Two hundred and fifty preterm infants ( mean birth weight, 1056 g ; mean gestational age, 28 weeks ; 57 % male ; and 43 % white ). The mean developmental quotient was the proportion of infants fed the enteral feeding ( 1 - 24, 25 - 49, and > or = 50 % of enteral feeding. The outcomes included duration of parenteral nutrition, and subsequent gains in weight, length, and head circumference.. The incidence of infection ( human milk [ 29.3 % ] vs formula [ 47.2 % ] ) and sepsis/meningitis ( 20 % vs 33 % ) was significantly lower than the control group. The number of infants receiving an exclusively human milk diet was associated with higher Bayley Mental Developmental Index scores, higher Bayley behavior score percentiles for emotional regulation, and fewer rehospitalizations..

The study design We aimed to compare the effects of an ad libitum, reduced-glycemic load ( LGI ) diet on the body mass index ( BMI ) and other obesity indices of obese adolescents. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We studied 156 children and adolescents with obesity. The primary outcome was hepatic lipid content measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Secondary outcomes included anthropometric parameters, blood lipid profiles, and indicators of glucose metabolism. The participants were r and omized to either an intervention with low GI diet ( consisting of 45 - 50 % carbohydrate, 30 - 35 % fat and 15 - 20 % protein ) or conventional Chinese diet as control (. ). Anthropometric measures and biochemical tests were measured in all children. At baseline, liver fat was 23.8 % [ st and ard deviation ( SD ) 12.2 ] in the low-glycemic-load group and 29.3 % ( 14.1 ) in those who received the control diet. The glycemic index in this group was 1.37 ( 95 % CI, 1.02–1.83 ). The GI was not significantly different between groups. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding BMI, diastolic blood pressure ( 3.0 and 3.6 kg, respectively ). In the study, the LGI diet was associated with lower BMI, insulin resistance, and the HOMA % B ( 1.3 GI U and 4.9 protein percentage points, respectively. The LP/HGI group increased body fat percentage significantly more than the other groups ( P =.040... ).

The aims of this study were to determine whether zinc supplementation could improve the levels of serum zinc, lipid profile biomarkers, and serum creatinine in adult diabetics on long-term follow-up. The study was to test the effects of oral zinc supplementation to patients with DM. The participants were divided into two groups: group A ( n = 31 ) and group B ( n= 31 ) was given the same placebo. The treatment and control groups were treated with 100 mg/day zinc or placebo, respectively, for 2 months. The serum zinc concentration was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Plasma retinol and zinc concentrations were higher in men than women but the opposite was observed with respect to HDL-cholesterol. After 7.5 yr, no difference between the sexes for the baseline total cholesterol levels and lipid-lowering medications. The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia ( ≥6.5 mmol/L ) showed a trend toward being higher in women who received zinc supplementation compared with those who received the placebo ( P=0.06 ). Cross-sectional study : levels of nonfasting triglycerides, levels of LDL, and Apo-B levels were similar. The differential effect on serum zinc was observed at week 12 and remained fairly constant ( P<0.05 ).. The antioxidant effect of the zinc supplementation had no effect on in vitro LDL oxidation parameters, nor were there any sex-related differences in serum lipids.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether the association between protein intake and the overall acid-base equilibrium of the diet ( as renal net acid excretion [ RNAE ] estimate ) and fracture risk vary according to calcium intake. A total of fifty-nine subjects  drank 200 mL yogurt drink twice ( at breakfast and lunch ) or the reference substance, sucrose. On d 8 of each treatment period, (44)Ca and (48)Ca were administered orally and intravenously, respectively. Before and during the 36 h after intake, proteins and RNAE, were measured in the Framingham study, a prospect i ve cohort study of older Caucasian men and women aged 67 - 93 y. During follow-up, 213 hip fractures were identified, excluding fractures associated with high-energy trauma and metastatic bone disease. There was no clear association between the dietary calcium intake or nondairy animal protein intake  and hip fracture in this cohort. However, an increased risk of fracture was found in women with a high intake of protein from dairy products ( OR, 0.65 ; 95 % CI, 1.17 - 1.94 ). In the full sample, the amount of Ca absorbed and excreted in urine did not differ between 2 diet groups ( P = 0.21 ).. The dietary treatments did not affect the incidence of hip fracture. The association between dietary calcium and vitamin D intake was observed in both whole-body bone mineral content ( difference : 35 + /- 16 g...

Several studies have suggested that use of PPI therapy is associated with increased risk of multiple falls and fractures among 1,509 community dwelling older adults. The study included the following study. PPI use was taken directly from the hospital records. The outcome measures were the incidence of fracture. The patients were included in the study. The primary exposure variables were use of PPIs and other risk factors for fractures, and the second prospect i ve study of falls in elderly postmenopausal women. The third study occurred after taking omeprazole ( 40 mg/day ) for 30 days. At baseline, 5 % of this population was using omeprazole.  Age-adjusted rates for vertebral fractures were 1.89 and 0.60 for 100 person-years for omeprazole users and nonusers, respectively ( P = 0.009 ). In the multivariate analysis, omeprazole use was a significant and independent predictor of vertebral fractures ( RR = 3.50, 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.14–8.44 ). The other predictors were age higher than 65 years ( OR = 1.45 ; 95 % CI 1.28–1.65 for hip fractures ; and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC ) of 0.58 ( CI, 0.53–0.62 )..

This study was unable to show any additional benefits for patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The study aims include prevention of psychosis onset and disability, as well as palliation of ongoing symptomatology. The current systematic review collates and critiques evidence obtained on the use of various atypical antipsychotic medications for adolescents with psychosis.. RESULTS : Subjects, selected because of prominent positive psychotic symptoms, were r and omly assigned to receive either risperidone ( n = 59 ) or placebo. The primary efficacy measure was response ( improvement ), defined as a decrease of 30 % or more in total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score from baseline to termination. In these data, ICCs were inversely related to cluster size, but the effect size was greater. The number of studies on treatment of adolescent-onset psychosis was larger. The majority of patients were below 0.01 at the district health authority level, and they were mostly below the threshold. At the household level, many participants were in the range of 0.0 - 0.3..

22861822," The present study investigated the acute effects of a brief bout of moderate intensity exercise on smoking withdrawal symptoms and tobacco withdrawal symptoms in smokers.  The current study was designed to determine whether a single bout of exercise would reduce cigarette cravings and attenuate increased cravings in response to smoking cues. Methods : Thirty-eight smokers attended the laboratory in the afternoon having not smoked since the previous evening. They rated their desire to smoke and withdrawal symptoms immediately before and at 5-min intervals for 20 min after chewing four 3-g glucose tablets ( experimental group ) or a placebo control. The frequency and intensity of these symptoms varied across subjects ; however, the average distress from the exercise compared with placebo. The percentage of dwell time and direction of initial fixation was assessed during the passive viewing of a series of paired smoking and neutral images... The data indicate that pre-abstinence measures of smoking motivation and desire that smoke were significantly lower for exercise, compared with the controls, in both environments.. Conclusion The study shows that acute exercise has a significant effect on motivation to quit smoking, with a significant difference between exercise and placebo, whereas those who engaged in HY reported a general decrease in cravings.. This study provides further support for the use of exercise bouts for attenuating smoking cravings during temporary nicotine abstinence. Results also suggest that, given adequate compliance, significant areas of activation were found in areas of the limbic lobe and in areas associated with visual attention ( DtS )."

19160253," The present study examined the efficacy of an 8-wk, cognitive-behavioral group treatment for panic disorder. The authors developed a scale for the measurement of panic disorder, and the side-effect and adverse effect profiles of both drug groups were measured. The seven-item Panic Disorder Severity Scale was administered to patients with panic disorder with mild to severe agoraphobia. The treatment consisted of : ( a ) education and corrective information ; ( b ) cognitive therapy ; ( c ) training in diaphragmatic breathing ; and ( d ) interoceptive exposure. At posttreatment, 85 % of treated patients were panic free, compared to 30 % of controls. There were no significant differences between the alprazolam group ( N = 18 ) and placebo. At baseline, both users and non-users reported a substantial number of symptoms, with higher levels in the more anxious patients. At 3 weeks plasma determination showed that the proportion taking  diazepam  outside the protocol was unclear, therefore we may consider making adjustments to the treatment..

Follow-up was completed an average of 70 months later. At study entry, subjects who reported pain, numbness, and tingling in any part of the body. Of the remaining subjects, 64 ( 13 men, 51 women ) woke up because of BPN. Among these subjects 1 man and 23 women were found to have CTS. The prevalence rate of undetected CTS was 5.8 % [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 3.5 - 8.1 % ] in adult women. The patient group additionally had raised thresholds for the elbow. The most common N/S MSD was somatic pain syndrome. The overall prevalence rate for men was 0.6 % ( 95 % CI 0.02 - 3.4 % ). The question naires were similar for each study group. The Overall prevalence rates of symptoms were similar, but reporting of work-relatedness and home-relatedrelatedness differed considerably between the two study groups. If the information letter focused slightly more on the workplace than the home, the subjects were more likely to report that their symptoms were work- related ( significant unadjusted odds ratios ( ORs ) between 1.8 and 5.5 ).

30463844," BACKGROUND To test whether the type and duration of dietary fiber and triacylglycerols ( TG ) are related to the metabolic effects of this sugar. The high sucrose diet produced no change in blood levels of cholesterol or phospholipids, or in glucose tolerance. In this study participants ( 20–60 years old ) were r and omly assigned to one of five groups, three that consumed low fat milk with added fructose, or a combination of these interventions on blood pressure, plasma lipids, glucose, insulin and inflammatory cytokines. RESULTS Twenty-four men and postmenopausal women were matched for weight and gender, those who consumed raisins had a significant 23 % reduction in postpr and ial glucose levels ( P = 0.024 ). The primary outcome measure was hepatic level of TAG, with additional assessment s of TAG levels in serum and soleus muscle, hepatic levels of adenosine triphosphate, and systemic and hepatic insulin resistance. The subjects completed a 2 wk run-in period, followed by a 6 wk intervention. There were no changes in fasting glucose ( 49 ± 0.4 vs. 5.0 +/- 0.5 mmol/L ), insulin ( 56.9 ± 38.9 vs. 61.8 ± 50.0 pmol/L ). Although walking reduced the incidence of diabetes, and to a smaller extent for sugar and complex carbohydrate intake. In men, the fructose diet produced significantly higher fasting plasma glucose, total sugars ( P < 0.001 ), and insulin concentrations than did the glucose diet.

23074516," BACKGROUND Oral anticoagulation ( OAT ) is the most effective stroke prevention medication for high-risk individuals with atrial fibrillation, yet it is often underused. This study examined the magnitude of this problem in a large contemporary, prospect i ve stroke registry. This r and omised trial was the first to compare this self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy with routine care.. A 6-month retrospective analysis was conducted. Patients 18 years of age and older were eligible if they were receiving warfarin for at least one month before enrolment and their INR, as assessed by therapeutic international normalised ratio ( INR ). We describe the rationale, design, baseline characteristics and interim analyses of outpatient INR. Patients were divided into two groups, the intervention group and the control group.. The primary outcome was to determine the effect of the INR values... the study was conducted in the outpatient setting. The intervention group received the target INR of 3.5 for patients with artificial heart valves ( target range : 2.5 - 4.5 ) and a target OR INR = 3.0.. Patients the other patients.

28466180, A prospect i ve study was conducted to determine if a short course of prophylactic antibiotics is as efficacious as a longer course in laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy. The purpose of this study was to systematic ally review the literature on antibiotic prophylaxis in gynaecologic surgeries to prevent inflammatory complications after gynaecological operations. RESULTS : In the metronidazole group a significantly higher grade of morbidity was observed than in the placebo group. The incidence of postoperative wound infections after elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis. The participants were evaluated for postoperative fever and infection for up to 4 weeks. Patients were r and omly allocated to receive amoxicillin-clavulanic acid ( 2.2 g ) [ Group A ] or cefazolin ( 2 g ). The difference was probably attributable to the prevalence and efficacy of prophylactic antibiotic use among the former group.
26498716," AIMS The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes of atrial fibrillation ( AF ) and the effects of routine blood pressure lowering on such outcomes in the presence or absence of AF. We investigated the safety and efficacy of catheter ablation of AF  in patients with DM. METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 160 patients ( aged 59 ± 9 years, 23 % females ) undergoing ablation of the AF procedure  were enrolled in this prospect i ve study. All patients had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) and were divided based on whether they received pioglitazone before ablation or not. The 589 ablated patients were compared with the 582 who received antiarrhythmic medications for SR control. The primary endpoint was the time to first AF recurrence. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, at the end of follow-up, 42.9 % of patients ( 91.7 % ) had a single AF, whereas at  the 3-year follow up, 53 % remained in SR. After a second procedure, the long-term overall success rate without antiarrHythmic drugs was 62 % with PVI and 85 % with TVI plus LL. Persistent/Permanent AF. The number of patients who were treated with AF ablation was higher than the control group ( 27 % ). The median duration of AF recurrence was 9.7 months ( interquartile range 603 - 1424 ) to 22.4 %, P = 0.240 ).. The only complication attributable to ablation was one significant access-site hematoma. CONCLUSION Atrial fibrillation is relatively common in type II diabetes and is associated with substantially increased risks of death and cardiovascular events in DM patients. Catheter ablation of atrial flutter ( AFCA ) is an established therapeutic option for rhythm control in DM. Its efficacy and safety among patients with AF is based on small population s, and late-term outcome of AFCA.-. -."
26920333," BACKGROUND The benefits of antihypertensive treatment in patients with diabetes mellitus. We assessed whether the angiotensin-converting-enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in these patients. The multicenter Hypertension Objective Treatment Based on Measurement by Electrical Devices of Blood Pressure ( HOMED-BP ; 2001–2010 ) trial involved 3518 patients ( 50 % women ; mean age 59.6 years ) with an untreated systolic hypertension ( sitting blood pressure 160 to 199 mm Hg ). On a mean follow-up of 6.0 years, 849 patients were r and omized to receive either ramipril ( 10 mg/day ) or placebo, and to follow the treatment with intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ). The combined primary outcome was myocardial infa rct ion, stroke, or cardiorenal death. The median follow time was 3.9 years. The mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was 2.9 mm Hg greater in the ramipril group than in those with placebo group ( P = 0.001 ). Mean blood pressure difference between the 2 groups was 0.36 mL/min per 1.73 m2 ( IQR : 0.18–0.53 mg/kg ) and had a greater incidence of the primary outcome. The primary end point was observed in 11.6 per 1000 patient-years and the average time to publication was 13.0 months. The secondary end point occurred in 1412 patients ( 5.2 % ), the incidence of stroke was lower than the control group ( 16.5 % )..

The present study was designed to determine the effect of silymarin on serum hepatitis C virus ( HCV ), chronic active hepatitis ( CAH ) and hepatic cirrhosis. The trial lasted for 40 days. The aims of this study were to assess whether long-term treatment with silybin or multivitamin supplements were effective in patients with liver diseases. RESULTS A double-blind r and omized controlled trial was performed in China. Patients receiving placebo and three groups were enrolled. The outcomes of interest were antiTB-DILI and the maximum liver enzymes at week 4. The baseline biochemical, virological, psychological and quality -of-life tests were compared between the two groups. The primary outcomes were the occurrence of probable and possible ATLI, the peak aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ), albumin, and liver fibrosis markers.  We treated 179 patients with NAFLD ; 36 were also HCV positive. The mean changes in the serum levels of ALT, AST, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase ( γGT ). The risk of developing probable ATLI was not significantly different between groups.

31858251," This article introduces the approach of GRADE to rating  quality of evidence.  GRADE specifies four categories-high, moderate, low, and very low-that are applied to a body of evidence, not to individual studies. In the context of a systematic review, quality reflects our confidence that the estimates of the effect are correct. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who gained ≥1 kg at week 4. The secondary end points were quality of life and appetite.. The study was a single center, two-arm, nonr and omized, open-label, nine-week pilot study of mirtazapine or citalopram in cancer patients with depression. The average age of patients ( 24 % ) gained 1 kg or more, 1 patient maintained weight ( gain of 400 g ) and 2 patients lost weight ( 800 g and 1.2 kg ). The evidence was identified by a literature search performed in PubMed through to October 2018. Expert opinion : Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of antidepressants for chronic pain. The total night sleep time and each item on the C-LSEQ improved from days 1 - 5. The scores for the MADRS and the depression/anxiety dimension and visual analog scale of EQ-5D improved significantly from the first week. Pain measures also improved from day 1. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of a treatment that alleviates more than one symptom, to avoid polypharmacy.. It would therefore be helpful to use the same treatment in patients with multiple distressing symptoms which are challenging to manage. The effectiveness of these treatment is unclear.

27889922," BACKGROUND Acute psychotic symptoms are elevated to varying degrees by antipsychotics. The authors have compared the effects of clozapine with those of other antipsychotic drugs. The objective of this study was to determine whether the efficacy of clozapine, olanzapine, and haloperidol on the incidence of aggression and whether they predict differential response to treatment. METHOD The subjects were 157 treatment-resistant inpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were included in the study. The study was divided into two periods : eight weeks during which the dosage was escalated and then fixed, and six weeks after which variable dosages were used. The hostility item of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) was the principal outcome measure. Planned assessment s included baseline and endpoint together with the PANSS items : hostility and poor impulse control. The number and severity of aggressive events, as measured by the Modified Overt Aggression Scale ( MOAS ), were the outcome measures. RESULTS Baseline depression and impulsivity predicted higher levels of aggression, and they were mostly below 0.05 at the postal code sector level. At the household level, many patients were > 125 mg/dl. The scores of patients taking clozapine indicated significantly greater improvement than those taking haloperidol. The findings suggest that the positive factor was followed by that of schizophrenia, the negative factor was more than placebo. In the psychiatric setting, there was a significant difference between haloperidol and those given clozapine. The negative factor is a significant challenge to clinicians and risk to service users. If people continue to be aggressive, it can lengthen hospitalisation. Haloperidol is used to reduce aggression, but there may be a higher risk for people with long-term aggression.

The mothers took 1 g of vitamin C tablets every day for 15 weeks. The patients were assessed daily for the incidence of colds, and multiple biochemical, anthropometric, and psychological measurements were made at the beginning and end of this study. The results showed no significant overall treatment effect on cold symptoms, but the response was not uniform in all sub-groups. The authors found that the placebo group had a significant preventive effect of  the colds. The role of oral ascorbic acid, but not those on placebo, was not reflected in different symptom complexes or in fewer sick-call visits or training days lost. This study and the literature do not support the prophylactic use of these trials. The literature review was to answer the following two questions : ( 1 ) Does regular high dosage supplementation with vitamin C ( vitamin C ) in treating colds? ( 2 ) Does the introduction of high dose vitamin C prevent the onset of cold?. There have also been a number of efforts to synthesize and /or overview the results of those trials, and controversy over what these overviews tell us.

30547275," Introduction : The efficacy and safety of a quantitative work productivity and activity impairment ( WPAI ) measure of health outcomes was tested for use in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The inflammatory bowel disease question naire ( IBDQ ), a disease-specific HRQOL questionnaire, can define changes in health status in IBD, but simple instruments are needed for daily application. The present study proposed to develop a short version of the IBDQ, the SIBDQ, for community physicians. The outcome was monitored by flexible proctosigmoidoscopic examinations and physicians'assessment s at three-week intervals and by patients'recordings of daily symptoms. Results showed 24 percent complete and 50 percent partial responses in those receiving 4.8 g of mesalazine versus placebo ( p = 0.001 ). A disease activity index based on patient symptoms and sigmoidoscopic appearance was used to assess efficacy. At Week 26, 67 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 62 %, 71 % ) of patients achieved response ; 48 % [ 95 % CI : 44 %, 53 % ] were in remission. For the overall population, significant [ all p < 0.05 ] improvements from baseline to Week 26 were observed for the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Question naire, total absenteeism, and absenteeism and presenteeism. As a way to better underst and the impact of this disease and its treatment on work-related outcomes.. The test reproducibility was adequate. At Month 12, significant improvements in work productivity ( health and symptom ) was observed in patients in remission ( CDAI < 150 points ) versus no remission. St and ardized Response Means ( SRMs ) were calculated to evaluate the magnitude of these changes. The WPAI in this patient population : its reliability, construct validity, ability to detect change, and responsiveness to effective treatments."
31846655," Background : The extent to which diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia is related to risk of death from cancer or other nonvascular conditions is largely unknown. Methods and Results : We prospect ively evaluated the relation between dietary patterns and risk of cardiovascular, cancer, and all-cause mortality among 72 113 women who were free of myocardial infa rct ion, angina, coronary artery surgery, stroke, diabetes mellitus, or cancer. Subjects and methods : Data from middle-aged adults with information on weight discrimination were analyzed ( n=986 ). From these over one million original participants, 275,190 men and 434,637 women aged > or = 30 years were selected for the primary analysis using predetermined criteria... Smoking and alcohol/drug use were tested as mediators of the hypothesized childhood risk-adolescent allostatic load relationship. RESULTS Cumulative risk exposure at age 9 predicted increases in the incidence of diabetes, and 1.73 ( 95 % CI, 1.62 to 1.85 ) for death from other causes.. A summary definition of AL was constructed using clinical ly-defined cutoffs and medication use for 10 physiological parameters in different body systems. Logistic regression models were run to determine associations between AL score and disease status, controlling for age, sex, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, total fat intake and energy intake. Parallel models were also run with MetS score replacing AL. Conclusion : Health risk behaviours ( HRB ) across the lifespan have been associated with higher cumulative physiological burden as measured by multiple organ dysfunction ( AL ). This study examines the contribution of HRB and their effects on multisystem biological risk associated with morbidity and early mortality."
32357844," Background : Despite evidence demonstrating that risk-factor management is effective in reducing recurrent cerebrovascular disease, there are very few structured care programmes for stroke survivors. The aim was to implement and evaluate an integrated care programme in stroke. Methods : This was a prospect i ve controlled trial of a comprehensive postdischarge care management intervention for patients with ischemic stroke and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores greater than or equal to 1 discharged from an acute stroke department. The intervention group received ‘ enhanced secondary prevention ’ ( additional advice, motivational interviewing and telephone support ) to change health behaviour. Both groups received a nurse practitioner/physician assistant care manager, group clinics, self-management support, report cards, decision support, and ongoing care coordination. The primary outcome was a change in cardiovascular Framingham Risk Score between baseline and 12 months. Secondary outcomes were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and self-reported alcohol consumption, smoking behaviour, exercise frequency, and fruit and vegetable consumption. Results : Analysis of the data for the 52 participants showed no statistical difference in the baseline level of physical activity ( p = 0.007 ) and number of walks taken ( p<0.001 ). Mean baseline SBP was 150 mm Hg in both arms. Postdischarge care management was not more effective than organized stroke department care with enhanced discharge planning in most domains in this population.. In adjusted analyses, the intervention group were significantly ( −3.6 mm Hg ; 95 % confidence interval, −9.2 to 2.2 ). Among secondary outcomes,  the effectiveness of an organized secondary prevention programme for stroke may be limited in patients from high-performing hospitals with regular post-discharge follow-up and communication with general practice.

20559827," BACKGROUND Minimally invasive total hip arthroplasty  is thought to result in less soft tissue damage than the classic approach. We carried out a prospect i ve and comparative study to evaluate the effectiveness of the minimally invasive posterior approach in comparison with the st and ard approach. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of a single mini-incision versus a traditional surgical approach.. The patients were divided into three groups according to the type of surgery and length of incision. The minimally invasive surgery ( MIS or CLASS ) was performed in 38 patients ; midi-incision ( 10–14 cm ) in 43 ; and the control group. The postoperative outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. The preoperative Harris Hip Score was significantly lower in the ALMI group ( p=0.04 ). The mean total postoperative pain scores were similar between both groups, the mean time to return to work was 8 days, discontinued use of any assistive device was 9 days, and resumption of all activities of daily living was 10 days. The median score for the surgical approach was significantly higher that the conventional approach. There were no dislocations, infections, ten days postoperatively, and twelve weeks after the operation. The overall postoperative outcome was good. The MIS group ( average 7.8 cm incision length ), and minimal invasive surgery was found to be preferable to conventional surgery. The two groups were comparable in terms of postoperative recovery. The surgical exposure was significantly less than conventional surgery, there was no difference in postoperative pain, the operative time and complication rate. Although not statistically significant, this surgical exposure has also been associated with increased risk of iatrogenic nerve injury and implant mal-positioning..AOC-+/90) .})..

OBJECTIVE Our objective was to examine the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of LB03002, a once-weekly GH formulation for children with idiopathic short stature ( GHD ). PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a phase III, 12-month, multinational, r and omized, open-label, comparator-controlled trial with the efficacy of GH replacement therapy in children with short stature. RESULTS Prepubertal GH treatment-naive GH-deficient children ( mean age, 7.8 y ) participated in the study.. We identified 397 children who had a diagnosis of GHD, weekly Jintrolong ( 0.2 mg/kg/week PEG-rhGH complex ) or daily rhGH. The study included 2 stages : Stage A assessed the effectiveness and PK/PD profiles of the 4 dosing regimens of GH.. In postmenopausal women there was no association between IGF-I concentrations and IGF-1 levels ( r=.64 ) and with IGF-II levels (. The primary endpoint for both studies was height velocity ( HV ) increase at the end of treatment. Other growth-related parameters, safety and compliance were also monitored. The mean±SD HV during year 1 was 11.63±2.60 cm/y with LB030002, and 11.97±3.09 cm/Y with daily GH. In the phase III study, the relative risk was 4.51 ( 1.75 - 12.0 ; p for trend =.02 ). The least square mean HV difference for GH dose was found to be noninferior to the daily GH injections. We aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-acting GH administration in children who have short stature."

25351783," BACKGROUND In developed countries, regular breakfast consumption is inversely associated with excess weight and directly associated with better dietary and improved physical activity behaviors. Our objective was to describe the frequency of breakfast consumption among school-going adolescents in Delhi and evaluate its association with overweight and obesity as well as other dietary, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors. Methods Design : Cross-sectional study. Setting : Eight schools ( Private and Government ) of Delhi in the year 2006. Participants : 1814 students from 8th and 10th grade s ; response rate was 87.2 % ; 55 % were 8th grade rs, 60 % were boys and 52 % attended Private schools. Main outcome measures : Body mass index, self-reported breakfast consumption, diet and physical activity related behaviors, and psychosocial factors. In experiment 2, all children had access to 1000 kcal of a preferred snack food. In both the cross-sectional and prospect i ve analyses, the children of mothers who worked part-time  watched less television and were less likely to be overweight than children who desired to remain the same weight. The'Mediterranean'dietary pattern was mainly followed by girls, and also boys who spent < 2 h/d on media screen time and the level of the control subjects. In the multivariate analyses. This evidence supports that the food pattern of Balearic Isl and s'adolescents is associated with a 23 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 17%-30 % ) increase in weight status. CONCLUSIONS Healthful dietary habits were associated mostly with  PA , whereas sedentary behaviours, independent of PA, negatively impacted upon eating behaviours. The low PA levels and high sedentary levels of Saudi females represent a great concern to prevent the associations between sedentary behaviour and dietary intake in young people and adults."

SETTING Health, Aging and Body Composition Study. PARTICIPANTS Three thous and forty-seven well-functioning older persons ( mean age 74.2 ).  Gait speed, cadence, stride length, stance, swing, double-support, and horizontal heel velocity at heel contact were measured in 50 transitionally frail older adults while walking at a self-selected pace. These data suggest that the temporal and spatial gait features of these older adults differ substantially from published results from other older adults. RESULTS : Rates of persistent lower extremity limitation events ( mean follow-up 4.9 years ) were calculated according to gait speed in Sample A. A cutpoint ( defining high- ( < 1 m/s ) and low risk ( > or = 1 m°/s ) groups. The effects of this intervention on frailty, mobility, hospitalisation and institutionalisation in frail older people. Methods and Design A single centre r and omised controlled trial comparing a multidisciplinary intervention with usual care. The intervention will target identified characteristics of gait speed, functional limitations, nutritional status, falls risk, psychological issues and management of chronic health conditions.  Two hundred and thirty people aged 70 and over who meet the Fried definition of frailty will be recruited for a 12-month period.. The EPESE battery was superior to Gait speed when both Pra and primary physician's risk estimate were included. Both performance measures predicted decline in function and health status in both health systems. When full weight-bearing is permitted, assessment without a walking aid is recommended to detect longitudinal change in walking disability in the older people at risk of further functional decline and institutionalization. The strategies  is a quick, inexpensive, reliable measure of functional capacity with well-documented predictive value for major health-related outcomes."

25359355," BACKGROUND The 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) is an important component of pulmonary rehabilitation for patients with COPD. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether exercise test performance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and whether a steady-state response was achieved when exercising at this intensity. The study was design ed to determine if a modified version of the 6-min walk tests, called the 9MWT, and the endurance shuttle walk. Methods : In a prospect i ve protocol we studied 40 patients with CHF were r and omized 2:1 to 7 weeks ER ( CHF-ER ). The mean+/-SD distance walked was the same as the baseline. The second test was compared with V˙O2peak from the better ISWT, the control group ( COPD -CON). There were strong correlations between the end-exercise saturation and walk-velocity parameters of  the two walking tests. χ The mean difference between those two sessions was -6.5 m, with limits of agreement between -74.9 m and 61.9m.. The 6MWD test could not predict the 7-min walking distance ( R2 = 0.33 ) than SHQ scores ( p<0.05 ). In unadjusted logistic regression models, there has been a wealth of new literature pertinent to the exercise capacity, which can be followed over time and evaluate treatment response in chronic respiratory diseases. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Field walking test is commonly employed to evaluate exercise capacity. to assess the quality of life in patients on LTOT, and it can be consistently employed by clinicians and research ers.

The authors prospect to assess whether exercise improves physical functioning and has been an intervention for cancer.. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of an oncologist ’s recommendation to exercise on self-reported exercise behavior in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients. The study was conducted in a prospect i ve design and an objective measure of exercise adherence. Participants were a convenience sample of 24 prostate cancer survivors attending a twice weekly, 12-week training program in preparation for a dragon boat race. Participants completed the  Six-Minute Walk Test ( 6MW ), Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ), and Timed Up & Go Test ( TUG ). A history of exercise was retained as a negative predictor of survival. Mean age was 66.9 years ( range 55 - 79 ). The post-treatment outcomes were examined within and between 2 groups. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance for repeated measures. The relationship between exercise and QOL was also analyzed using multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS Male patients had significantly improved their lifestyle compared with controls at 12 months. The quality -of-life scores were high across the 4 groups, even after adjusting for age, CMDI, and percentage of body fat. The PA group was more likely than controls to progress in motivational readiness for PA and to meet PA guidelines. No significant group differences were found in body mass index, and the 8-foot ( 2.5 m ) up- and -go test ( dynamic balance. Because ADT acts by means of reducing testosterone production, exercise may offset many of the ADT side effects..

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol added to a regimen of conventional antiepileptic drugs ( alcohol ) in a sample of alcohol dependence, and placebo. The authors conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of alcohol-dependent subjects ( n = 10 ). The mean daily consumption of alcohol and placebo was compared. The primary outcome was a 12-week treatment with either placebo or zonisamide. Subjects received a baseline evaluation including Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and the Severity of Alcohol Dependence Scale. Primary outcome parameters were the overall rate and time to relapse with heavy drinking. The placebo group was continued to the same level of alcohol. The study showed that the placebo group had significantly greater than the group. The clinical outcomes were : self-reported drinking ( drinks per day, drinks per drinking day, percentage of heavy drinking days, and percentage of days abstinent ). There was substantial interest in the therapeutic potential of CBD. The majority of patients treated with CBD, a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid found in plants, tolerated treatment early compared with patients receiving placebo.. The current systematic review was able to characterize the existing literature on this topic and to demonstrate the feasibility of CBD as a c and i date pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder."

METHODS A two-group ( those admitted to the ICU vs. those not admission to ICU ). PARTICIPANTS Adults with SCI ( N=88 ) admitted over a period of 32 months into 3 SCI units. INTERVENTIONS Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES FIM Motor Scale ( Rasch transformed ) and acute rehabilitation length of stay ( LOS ). RESULTS In the tetraplegia sample, co-occurring TBI was not related to PTSD, self-perception and coping were collected before, immediately after and 6 weeks following the intervention. The effect of previous assaultive violence persisted over time with little change. CONCLUSIONS This study provides evidence that persons aged 16 to 59 years with paraplegia and either no TBI or mild TBI. The intervention group alone completed measures of psychological disorders of 17 % to 25 % were substantially higher than rates found in the Australian community. The occurrence of psychological disorder comorbidities was also very high. Personality was significantly elevated in those with a psychological disorder. Significant correlations were also found between self-regulation, and anxiety and depression. Although these results are consistent with a sensitization hypothesis, like the results from previous research on PTSD, they do not address the mechanism of increased responsivity to stress."

METHODS Twenty-five subjects were assessed by measuring contrast sensitivity with and without glare. Gray, brown, yellow, green, purple, and blue lens tints were evaluated. Each group wore 1 of 3 types of lenses while performing an intensive computer task for 2 hours. To evaluation the effect of blocking soft-light light, we measured the CFF and evaluated subjective question naires. We used the analysis of variance test to examine whether the type of lenses tested affected any of the visual fatigue-related parameters. A total of eighty computer users were recruited from two age cohorts ( young adults : 18–30 yrs, middle-aged adults : 40–55 yrs ).  Contrast sensitivity under st and ard and glare conditions. The aim of this review was to investigate the relative benefits and potential harms of these lenses. Compared to it, only the Blu Blockers and Vuarnets affected D‐15 cap arrangements for these SWAF's significantly. Blu Blocker error patterns had no predominant axis, whereas the predominant axis of errors in both Vuarnet conditions was tritan. Results of quantitative analysis performed on three factors confirmed that the subjects'circadian baseline and objective outcome measures may be beneficial under intense light conditions."

25636811," Introduction : Many studies support the role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of both types of diabetes. Pancreatic tissues express the vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) and vitamin D-binding protein ; some allelic variations in genes involved in vitamin D metabolism and VDR are associated with glucose intolerance, defective insulin secretion, and sensitivity. SETTING HD centers in 3 teaching university hospitals. METHODS HD patients were r and omized into 2 groups.. Each group ( n = 24 ), the dialysis patients were then studied with ( + D ) and without ( -D ) a single intravenous dose of 1,25(OH)2D3 at 2 micrograms/m2, given two hours before the IVGTT or clamp studies. During the -D studies,  the uremic patients were glucose intolerant but not hyperinsulinemic... The primary outcome was the change in IR measured by the glucose disposal rate ( GDR ) using hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp ( HEGC ) method. Secondary outcomes included changes in IR between groups in indirect indices of IR, biomarkers of inflammation, and adipokine levels. RESULTS The mean age was 49 years ( range, 46 - 57 years ) and 40 % of patients were women. There was no detectable change in serum intact parathyroid hormone ( HbA1C ), homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-insulin resistance, and HOMA-β-cell function% ( B% ). Blood glucose significantly decreased after calcitriol treatment at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. In the other two groups there were no significant changes in any parameters. These results seem to confirm that vitamin D supplementation improves insulin resistance in patients with kidney disease."

20881587," BACKGROUND To evaluate the effectiveness of a multifactorial rehabilitation program on falls and related outcomes in older people. DESIGN Cluster, r and omized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS 196 residents ( aged 60 years or over ) in 20 residential care facilities. SETTING The study took place at two long-term care facilities with services ranging from independent living to skilled nursing. PATIENTS AND METHODS All consenting residents ( n = 173 ) aged 65 and older, who could be assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ; n = 378 ). An MMSE score of 19 was used to divide the sample into one group with lower and one with higher level of cognition. The intervention program consisted of two 45–60-minute training sessions per week. The control group ( CG ) and 1,399 for the intervention group ( IG ). At baseline there was a mean of 2.2 falls per resident per year, the median time spent on activity of at least moderate intensity was 32 min/d.. The mean Mini Mental State Examination and Geriatric Depression Scale scores were 25.2 and 4.1 points, respectively. There were no between-group differences in mobility ( 16 % ), balance ( 9 % ), and incidence of falls did not differ among the treatment and control groups. CONCLUSIONS KE strength and endurance, stair-climbing power, and the gait speed were significantly higher in the control group compared with the group ( p=0.001 ).

26567029," BACKGROUND : Functional dyspepsia ( FD ) is a common condition in the general population ; however, its treatment remains a challenge. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of t and ospirone, a 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A receptor agonist, on the symptoms of FD. We investigated the effects of the serotonin-1A ( 5-HT(1A ) ) receptor agonist in patients with FD. : Two similar placebo-controlled clinical trials were conducted ( International and North America ). Males and females, 18–65 years old, with a diagnosis of FD ( Rome II ) and the absence ( by upper endoscopy ) were recruited. The study included 2 treatment periods of 4 weeks each, separated by a 2-week washout period. The primary end point was change in abdominal symptom scores. The improvement of symptom score in levosulpiride group was higher than the placebo group ( p<0.05 ). The co- primary end points were : ( 1 ) global patient assessment ( GPA ) of efficacy ; and ( 2 ) Leeds Dyspeptic Question naire ( LDQ ).. At these doses, mean pain intensities on a 0 - 100 visual analog scale were greater for FD than controls. In both the ITT and PP, there was no difference in total symptom scores, but at week 8 on itopride versus placebo, with the majority of patients ( 57 % ) having a tendency for superiority of placebo ( -1.12 vs-0.51, P = 0.07 ). Conclusion : The majority of FD patients were asymptomatic, with no significant difference in pain scores ( P =.05 ) and pain thresholds. A total of 43 patients were identified with FD, but the proportion of FD demonstrate visceral hypersensitivity, abnormal central pain processing, and low mood, but it is unclear whether it is an effective treatment for the condition.+.A)."

The type of operation and the choice of implant, however, is a matter of discussion. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether open reduction and internal fixation of unstable proximal radius fractures with an average follow-up of 29 months ( range 24–36 months ) were compared. The inclusion criteria were women ≥ 50 years with an unstable or non-union wrist fracture. The patients were r and omized to either closed reduction and bridging external fixation. The patient-reported outcome was assessed with the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and H and ( DASH ) question naire. The DASH, this difference diminished with time and in absolute terms the difference in range of movement was clinical ly unimportant. The mean DASH score was similar in the fracture group and those without fracture, 57 degrees for radial/ulnarduction ( = 90 % ), and 177 degrees for pronation/supination. The validity of all is suspected for wrist trauma. The postoperative pain score was 13 ( 0 - 100 ). Secondary outcomes were ROM ( flexion/extension ; supination/pronation ). The non-bridging group had a significantly better radial length at 6 months. The clinical outcome measures ( PROMs ) were important tools for assessing outcomes following injuries to the h and and wrist. The study showed that the ankle and wrist joints have no evidence of reliability, validity, and responsiveness in this population. This systematic review examines the PROMs used to assess outcomes following injury to a h and/ or wrist in trauma patients. The majority of PROMs used in these patients were not reliable, and therefore, the outcomes following fractures of these joints were very good. The PROMs used for evaluating outcomes following h and or wrist injuries are not reliable. and."

31848147," This exploratory r and omized controlled trial tested the effectiveness of an iPad ® application ( app ) social script intervention for children with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) going to imaging and their parent ( n=32 parent/child dyads ). The app engaged children, who played consistently, regardless of developmental level, and was rated highly by parents. There were no significant group differences in parent-report measures post-intervention, nor in a measure of parent – child play at follow-up. Therefore, this intervention did not have an observable impact on real-world social communication skills and caution is recommended about the potential usefulness of iPad ™ apps for amelioration of difficulties in interaction. However, positive attitudes among participants, lack of harms and the possibility of apps to deliver therapeutic content at low economic cost suggest this approach is worth pursuing further, perhaps targeting other skill domains."
20565960," Introduction : Some of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRI)-induced motor side effects are mediated by stimulating 5-HT2 receptors in the basal ganglia. The trials, however, included patients with motor complications, raising the question of whether the antidepressant benefit represented only a treatment – related motor improvement. To address this issue, we have conducted a 14–week r and omized trial comparing pramipexole with that of low doses of amitriptyline. At seven Italian centers, 67 Parkinsonian out patients with major depression but no history of motor fluctuations and /or dyskinesia received open – label treatment with either sertraline ( at 1.5 to 4.5 mg/day ) or citalopram, a SSRI ). Depression was improved to the same extent in both groups after two weeks of treatment ( 38 % and 32 % for group 1, 41 % and 33 % for Group 2, respectively ). At week 8 the proportion of patients who recovered, as defined by a final HAM – D score ≤ 8,was significantly higher, at 60.6 % versus 27.3 % ( p = 0.006 ). All adverse events were mild or moderate. All of these scores changed over time in group 1 than in group 2.. Citalopram  did not worsen motor performance in IPD, but improved bradykinesia and finger taps after 1 month and 4 months treatment both in patients with and without depression ( p < 0.05 versus baseline ). A clear improvement in mood was also observed in 15 of 16 patients with depression. Although our results can be confirmed in a larger clinical trial, nefazodone ought to be considered over fluoxetine given its secondary beneficial effects regarding the reduction of extrapyramidal symptoms in depressed PD patients."
28003239," Primary objective : The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between soccer heading and computerized neurocognitive performance and symptoms in female and male youth soccer players. Methods : Sixteen division I soccer players participated in this pre-test post-test design study. Subjects either kicked or headed 18 soccer balls over the course of 40 minutes. Subjects had their  postural control assessed while st and ing on a force plate and completed a  concussion symptoms checklist  on three separate occasions : prior to, immediately following, and 24 hours after kicking or heading. Results : Computerized neurocognitive performance ( e.g., verbal and visual memory, motor processing, and reaction time ) and symptoms. The heading group did, however, report significantly more concussion symptoms than the kicking group immediately after heading. The number of previous concussions. The authors conclude that head impacts were relatively uncommon and low in acceleration in youth playing a weekend soccer tournament. This study adds to the limited data regarding head impacts in youth soccer. However, there were statistically significant, moderate, negative correlations ( r = -0.500:-0.757, p <.05 ) between neck strength and result ant header acceleration. The reported sex differences in heading exposure warrant further attention. These findings are preliminary, as the small sample size in each group may have played a role in the effects of football heading."

30591077," OBJECTIVE To determine whether a behavioral Internet treatment ( BIT ) program for weight management is a viable, cost-effective option compared with usual care. We hypothesized that subjects who kept track via their preferred method would demonstrate higher adherence and therefore improved outcomes compared to those who used a non-preferred method. RESULTS This study evaluated the efficacy of the Army's education-based weight-management program, "" Weigh to Stay, "" with and without meal replacements, and to promote weight and body fat loss in overweight US Army soldiers. The intervention used a participatory and empowering approach, self-monitoring and networking among the canteen staff, management and a consultant. The study found that participants were completely effective at preventing weight gain in a subgroup of men ( those above the lowest three ranks, with baseline weight above maximum allowable ) and in women, while controls continued to gain weight. Since the intervention did not require personalized contact, this approach has promise for large-scale population -based interventions..Conclusion : The intervention group showed a higher increase in the intake of dietary fibre  ( P < 0.001 ) and  folate.. The results suggest that the treatment group was more adherent to recording both food intake ( 64.2 % vs. 43.4 %, p=.015 ) and physical activity. A paired t test was performed to compare changes in weight loss and food-group fat intake from baseline values for the exercise-plus-diet group. The effectiveness of this systematic review is to examine the evidence and describe key components of effective interventions in terms of improving body composition, dietary behaviors,and physical activity among active-duty military personnel."

23235652," BACKGROUND Maternal zinc deficiency is thought to be common in young children in developing countries.. Observational studies of zinc deficiency in infants and children suggest that zinc supplementation may be important for growth and psychomotor development. OBJECTIVE We assessed the effect of zinc supplementation of infants born full term and small for gestational age... The study was a r and omized, controlled trial with 2 x 2 factorial design.  Development and behavior were evaluated at 6 and 12 mo of age by using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II and the Home Observation Measurement of Environment ( HOME ).. : During a 20-month period, all singleton, term infants weighing 1500–2499 g born to families of low income ( < US $ 280/month ) were enroled at birth ( n=205 ). A total of 2457 children had not walked at the time of entry into the study. The children's social background s, weights, and lengths were also recorded. RESULTS The children’s nutritional status was generally poor. The  zinc supplementation was higher in infants receiving zinc ( 16.7 + /- 5.2 micromol/L ), iron and zinc ( 12.1 + / - 3.8 micromol/ L ) or iron alone ( 11.5 - /- 2.5 micromol/kg ). The mortality analysis was performed using a survival analytic approach that models time until death as the dependent variable. The mental development index scores of the infants were significantly lower than those of children. The mean at 12 months for the SG was higher than for placebo.. Zinc supplementation was associated with significantly lower mortality, with a rate ratio of 0.32 ( 95 % confidence interval : 0.12 - 0.89 ). Zn supplementation compared to placebo on measures of psychomotor development or cognitive function in children. CONCLUSIONS Zinc supplementation is a significant public health problem in low- and middle-income countries. Zinc deficiency is an important determinant of both the formation and migration of neurons along with the development of cognitive function. and .. Zinc administration in infants or children is a possible strategy to improve the production of neural pathways and with cognitive function ( for example, gross and fine motor skills, temperament ) and development ( for instance, social skills )."
30058911," BACKGROUND A high body-mass index ( BMI ) is associated with high risk of mortality, and improvements in fitness are associated with reduced mortality. The combined results suggest that increased adiposity causes a reduction in physical activity. Experimental overfeeding in humans is a unique situation to tackle these events.. The study was to examine the effect of 50 %, 100 %, and 150 % of the NIH Consensus Development Panel recommended physical activity dose on mortality. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Forty-four healthy men were involved in an overfeeding protocol with a lipid-enriched diet ( + 760 kcal/d ) for 2 months.  Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies were taken for histology, transcriptomics, and Western blotting. The analyses were adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and study. To limit reverse causality, the first 5 years of follow-up were excluded. Among healthy participants who never smoked, there was a J-shaped relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality.. With a BMI of 22.5 to 24.9 as the reference category, hazard ratios among women were 1.47 ( 95 percent confidence interval [ CI ], 1.33 to 1.62 ) for type 2 diabetes. Obese individuals who were active 1 to 3.5 h/wk had a lower risk than sedentary, obese individuals.. Above this range, positive associations were recorded for several specific causes and inverse associations for none..

26739716," OBJECTIVE To investigate whether personal and work-related factors, which contribute to the transition from acute to chronic low back pain. The influence of psychological factors on the outcome of acute pain. A prospective cohort study was conducted to study whether there is similarity regarding the factors that predict persisting pain and disability. Methods : Patients presenting to primary care with a new episode of shoulder pain were recruited from primary care to a r and omized study. Data on potential predictive factors were collected at baseline and ( ii ) those with a recent headache at baseline. In both patient groups, the variables groups of the four different domains. The primary outcome measures were the presence of pain, perceived functional disability, generic health-related quality of life, satisfaction with care, and costs... The overall chronic pain prevalence of 19 % was found −16 % for men and 21 % for women.. In respondents with recent pain at baseline, less severe headaches at baseline predicted recovery from pain. In patients with shoulder pain, most associations of pain were significant predictors of 4‐week disability and work status. The main outcome was patient-rated improvement, which was measured 6 months after consultation and cross-vali date. The prevalence of pain was significantly associated with disability in chronic LBP. The only significant predictor at baseline was the duration of sick leave, with the majority of patients undergoing rehabilitation..Conclusion This systematic review aims to identify generic prognostic factors for disability and sick leave in subacute pain patients."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of dental magnification loupes on clinical posture in the interest of decreasing WRMD. The study was undertaken at the University of Birmingham School of Dentistry in 2006. The treatment chosen was h and -scaling.  Neck pain was assessed during an Advanced Simulation Course ( AS ) using virtual reality-based technology ( VRBT ). We developed Rayyan ( http://rayyan.qcri.org ), a free web and mobile app, that helps expedite the initial screening of abstract s and titles using a process of semi-automation while incorporating a high level of usability. For the beta testing phase, we used two published Cochrane review s in which included studies had been selected manually. Their search es, with 1030 records and 273 records, were uploaded to Rayyan... They were assessed using an adapted version of Branson et al.'s Posture Assessment Instrument ( PAI ). Results of a paired t-test indicate that the posture of the students while wearing magnification lenses was more acceptable ( p < 0.05 ) than when wearing traditional safety glasses. The authors found that students completed more preparations, worked faster per procedure, and used the computer-assisted evaluation less frequently and for shorter periods, therefore displaying greater overall performance. The survey revealed a high degree of student acceptance of using magnification. Conclusion Both tools performed quite differently when evaluating the risk of bias or method ological quality of studies in knowledge translation interventions for cancer pain. The newly introduced CCRBT, identified and reported in user feedback, were its ability to help in screening and collaboration. and.).)}}.. Static and awkward working postures are considered as major risk factors. Proper seat selection and use of magnification loues are promoted for their ergonomic benefits."
23236190," OBJECTIVE To determine whether spa therapy plays a primary role in the treatment and prevention of  osteoarthritis  that has been recognised since antiquity. Numerous studies have demonstrated its clinical benefits and its effects on inflammatory mediators ( interleukins ), the immune system, cenesthesic factors ( endorphins ), and the diencephalic – pituitary – adrenal axis. This study was conducted to assess the efficacy of mud pack treatment, which is able to diminish TNF-alpha serum values, on specific TNF receptor ( sTNF-R ) levels. The main endpoint criteria were patient self-assessed. The therapies were applied for 20 min duration, once a day, five times per week and a total of 10 session. Patients were assessed at baseline, after 15 days and after 12 weeks, and finally after the intervention. Pain was assessed by using Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) and Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ). We found small changes in sTNF-Rs serum values but these were not statistically significant. The results showed a significant improvement of all parameters at the end of the cycle of balneotherapy which persisted throughout the follow-up period. In the group treated with natural mud compresses, a significant reduction in knee pain was observed at all assessment s. Similarly, improvement in VAS and WOMAC pain scores in group I ( p<0.001 ), no significant change in WOMAC functional and transitory side effects. Our results suggest that the beneficial effects of mud bath treatment in patients with knee OA lasts over time."

This double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to assess the effectiveness and side effects of the herbal medicine called Free and Easy W and erer Plus ( FEWP ) as an adjunct to carbamazepine, and placebo. RESULTS Patients with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder received either divalproex, the placebo, or placebo. The primary outcome measure was mean change from baseline to week 6 on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) total score. Secondary outcomes included rates of response and remission... The authors found that the majority of patients ( 63.8 % ) and placebo as well as number of shifts in symptom status and polarity during the entire follow-up period were examined. The mean doses at week 6 were 274 + /- 128 mg for LTG and 3,987 +/- 856 mg for GBP. The percentage of patients meeting a priori response criteria ( > or = 50 % decrease from baseline in mean MADRS,  the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and the Young Mania Rating Scale. CONCLUSIONS The treatment was not superior to placebo at any time point, but the mean change in depressive episode was 21.4 weeks and until 25 % experienced a manic/hypomanic/mixed episode was 85.0 weeks. The overall mean ( SD ) of patients with bipolar depression was 38.5 % ( 10.9 % ). The proportion of patients on placebo was significantly higher than those on treatment. The clinical efficacy of this phase was not significant. The optimal treatment for bipolar depression is to provide up date d evidence about the use of anticonvulsants in treating acute bipolar depression."
30113661," BACKGROUND Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is becoming a public health problem worldwide and the potential therapeutic role of probiotics in the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( T2D ). This study was conducted to determine the effects of daily consumption of probiotic yogurt on liver enzymes, serum glucose and lipid profile in patients with NASH. : In this controlled clinical trial, 70 type II diabetic patients ( n = 62 ) or a control group ( n= 62 ) were enrolled. The participants were r and omly allocated to one of the following treatments during 3 months : group I, treated with one tablet per day with 500 million of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. The anthropometric variables, serum lipid profile, and fecal microbiome were measured at baseline and after therapy... The results showed that probiotic supplementation significantly attenuated hepatic fat accumulation ( 0.10 ± 0.03 g/g liver tissue ) compared with the model group ( P = 0.002 ). In addition, there was no improvement in serum calcium, magnesium, aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) and total bilirubin. The consumption of a synbiotic food, compared to the control food, resulted in a significant reduction of serum calcium levels ( −0.66 vs. -0.14 mg/dL, P < 0.01 ).. Serum calcium significantly increased after probiotic supplementation but no change in serum iron, AST and ALT levels. The probiotic group also had greater reduction in serum albumin, ALT : 50.49 vs. 22.96 U/L ; P<0.05 ). These results suggest that C. tora supplements can help improve intestinal bacterial communities. This association has prompted research into the feasibility of these therapies in type I diabetic patients with NAFLDs. andA.+)."

A pharmaceutical treatment is often used to improve patient compliance and diet effectiveness. Obese adolescents with normal glucose tolerance, with a body mass index ( BMI ) > 95th percentile, and insulin-resistant, to receive metformin or placebo in a r and omized trial. To treat the effect of metformin on BMI, the insulin resistance were quantified using the homeostasis model assessment ( HOMA ), and liver magnetic resonance images were obtained. Results : Forty-two of 66 recruited children ( 7–18 years ) completed 6 months. The prevalence of fatty liver was 0.6 % in the placebo group compared to 3.0 % for the metformin group ( P = 0.002 ). Of subjects treated with metformin for 12 months, 84.9 % became normoglycaemic, and the BMI and HOMA  were also studied. In the subsequent medication period, HOMA was significantly decreased in both groups.. At 24 months, metformin compared with placebo did not have significant effects on blood pressure, insulin resistance, and abdominal adiposity. The study population consisted of 29 white and black adolescents aged 12 to 19 years. All had BMI < 30 kg/m2.. The metformin group had significantly lower BMI ( p<0.04 ), total cholesterol ( p <0.05 ) and insulin through a systematic review and network meta- analysis and to identify the most suitable dosage and intervention period for using metformin  in adolescents and adults."
17595425," A retrospective case-control study was used to determine the effectiveness of a targeted, multiple intervention falls prevention programme in a geriatric rehabilitation unit. The study was conducted in a 680-bed acute-care hospital in Western Australia.. : Fifty patients ( 60 women, 10 men ; mean age 84 years, range 67 - 97 years ) at increased risk of falls.. Retrospective cohort study. All patients having one or more risk factors that predisposed them to falls were included. A risk factor model was developed through stepwise logistic regression. In this setting, the three methods of assessing fall risk showed good sensitivity but poor specificity. The best fitting model included 2 Log L chi square statistic as well as sensitivity and specificity values retrospectively. The result of the study is an easy to use vali date d  Hendrich Fall Risk Model  with eight assessment parameters to assess the patient's level of fall risk.. The intervention group ( n = 310 ) experienced 30 % fewer falls than participants in the control group ( p = 1.00 ). The difference was significant ( Peto log rank test P = 0.045 ) and was also tested using a Spearman's correlation... CONCLUSION The study showed that there was a significant correlation between the incidence of falls ( relative risk 0.79, 95 % CI 0.65 - 0.95 ) but not on control wards ( RR 1.12 - 1.33 ).. There was no significant bias in evaluations of tool predictive accuracy, which would then contribute to program failure in practice."
23324965," We studied prospect ively the long-term results of the Charnley cementless acetabular components in 184 consecutive young patients ( 194 hips ). There were 130 men and 54 women with a mean age of 49.1 years ( 21 to 60 ). The predominant diagnosis was osteonecrosis of  the femoral head ( 63.6 % ). In the 23 patients who had died ( 26 hips ) only one acetabular component had been revised. The mean follow-up was 11.2 years ( 10 to 12 ). Of the 14 revisions, seven were for osteolysis, five for loosening and two for infection. The survival analysis of this implant showed a total probability of survival of 83 % ( 95 % confidence interval 73 to 90 ), with all revisions as the end-point. The overall survival rates of cemented compared with cementless THA. The cementless tapered stem was associated with a survivorship of 99 %. The revision to the acetabular component was performed in the majority of patients. Most total hip arthroplasties being performed in North America currently use cemented acetabular components. The use of cementless hip arthroplasty has gained popularity over the past decade. The incidence of revision surgery was the same for both the cemented and cementless acetabular component. The majority of revision surgeries were performed in patients who were older than 60 years. The study showed that the survivorship and revision rate of acetabular components were similar.

25442969," Theoretical models suggest that social networks influence the evolution of cooperation, but to date there have been few experimental studies. The authors analyze the structural properties and robustness of a discussion network about mercury issues in a community in the Brazilian Amazon. In our study, we examine the effects of a broader spectrum of network members ( 40 people ) on mothers'infant feeding decisions. The survey was conducted in Oaxaca, Mexico as part of a follow-up to a nationwide Mexican Social Security Institute survey of infant health. Sixty mothers were interviewed from a stratified r and om sample of the original respondents.  Multivariate tests were used to compare the efficacy of network-level variables for predicting the introduction of 36 foods into infants'diets. We show that, in both an ordinary public goods game and in a public goods games with punishment, focal individuals are influenced by fellow group members ’ contribution behavior in future interactions with other individuals who were not a party to the initial interaction. This pattern of excessive giving by leaders is consistent with the sharing-as-signaling hypothesis. On average, residents living in “ far villages ” had 2 more social contacts than those in “ close villages, ” and 12 more years of residence in their village.. Estimates of transmissibility ( a measure of outbreak potential ) based on network structure varied as much as 2-fold across these villages. These results show experimentally that cooperative behavior cascades in human social networks and demonstrate the important role that dynamic social networks may be particularly vital to health outcomes."
29508661," Background The  fixation of tibial component in total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) is subject of many studies using roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis ( RSA ). In previous studies of cemented and uncemented transibial components, the migration rates were found to be similar. In the present study, we investigated the long-term migration measured by radiostereometric analysis to the femoral component. In Group 2, 15 patients were operated on with the same cemented knee prosthesis, and the one-year follow-up examination. We performed a systematic review and meta-analyses to evaluate the mechanical properties of the knee component. Two- and three-compartment prostheses were compared between the groups. The mean migration was similar in the two groups.. The total point motion ( MTPM ) of three femoral components  was measured after 2 years. The majority of patients were followed up clinical ly and with roentgenstereometric analysis. The primary outcome was component migration at three months, and at 6, 12, and 24 months. There were no differences in prosthesis migration, pain scores, range of motion, and Knee Society Score.. Conclusion - The overall migration at 1 year was 1.66 mm for HA, 1.9 mm for the uncoated and 0.3 mm in Group 3, and 1 mm in group 4. At the 2-year followup, there were no significant differences between them. The early and late migration patterns of  the retrieved components.

25162440," BACKGROUND The management of an appendiceal mass is the most commonly performed operation in patients with Crohn ’s disease. With the advent of antibiotics design ed to prevent the growth of anaerobes, early appendectomy can now be carried out without complication. The authors studied 56 patients with acute appendicitis complicated by periappendiceal abscess ≥ 3 cm in size were subjected to three groups : Group A -- initial conservative treatment followed by interval appendectomy. The first group received treatment with ultrasound guided-percutaneous drainage and i.v. antibiotics ( ampicillin, cefuroxime, and metronidazole ), and the other group received antibiotics only. RESULTS of the 45 patients with a mesocolic abscess, 7 ( 15 percent ) required surgery, while deep wound infection had occurred in 9 ( 39 percent ) patients. The mean hospital stay was 3 ± 0.25 day. No major complications had occurred. This was a pilot study with a sample size of 40 patients. In patients in Group A, operative time was less, adhesions were encountered less frequently, the incision had to be extended less often and post-operative complications were fewer. The  mean duration of symptoms at presentation was 8.4 + /- 7.6 days. The aim of this study was to assess the various treatment modalities with respect to complications and treatment failure."
29359958," BACKGROUND : We have previously demonstrated acute dose-dependent increases of hepatic triglycerides ( steatosis ) in the presence of st and ard antidiabetic treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes, in a r and omized placebo-controlled double-blinded parallel clinical trial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on arterial stiffness assessed by CAVI. The main outcome measure was insulin sensitivity by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique. RESULTS Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity were not affected by resveratrol treatment. Intrahepatic lipid content also remained unaffected by resveratrol ; however, the change in intrahepatic lipid content correlated negatively with plasma resveratrol levels ( R = −0.68, P = 0.03 ). The control group received only oral hypoglycemic agents, whereas the intervention group received resveratrol ( 250 mg/d ). Body weight ( BW ), blood pressure ( BP ), glucose and lipid metabolic parameters, and diacron-reactive oxygen metabolites ( d-ROMs ; an oxidative stress marker ) were also measured. Resveratrol supplementation significantly improved systolic BP ( -5.5 ± 13.0 mmHg ), diastolic BP ( p < 0.005 ), total lipid content ( p =.03 ), and CAVI ( -0.4 ± 0.7 ).  Resveratrol treatment was not associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity or markers of the metabolic syndrome, except for a transient decrease in systolic BP. Microarray analysis and qRT-PCR revealed no major changes in expression profile. Conclusion : We aim ed to assess the impact of resveratrol supplementation on BP through systematic review of literature and meta- analysis of available clinical trials."

Design : A prospect i ve blinded study with allocation of patients into their groups by alternate weeks. Setting : A single-blinded r and omised controlled trial. The primary aim was to compare the effectiveness of a home-based exercise programme ( exercise, movement strategies, and cueing ) and a control group. Methods : Thirty-three participants ( mean age=66.2 years, SD=13.2 ; 53 women, 40 men ) with PD. The subjects with PD were evaluated at the end of first and second month after the baseline evaluation. Participants were divided into two groups. Those in the first and third week were assessed ( after 10 sessions of physical therapy ). The participants completed the TUG and the DGI assessment s twice, about 14 days apart. The MDC was calculated from the st and ard error of measurement. The percentage MDC ( MDC% ) was calculated as the difference between the 2 groups. The mean cost of the intervention was £ 76 per participant. Although in direction of favour of exercise intervention, there was no significant differences between groups in total healthcare ( −£128, 95 % CI : -734 to 478 ), the total score was significantly higher for the exercise group ( p = 0.04 ), and those of  the control group ( ICC=.92 ), whereas interrater reliability was similar ( ICC =.98 ). A home- based rehabilitation programme for patients with Parkinson ’s disease helped to improve balance-related activities and quality of life compared with no intervention. Conclusion : Semi-based prescribed exercise is a feasible and safe form of exercise compared with the usual care. and.A).--.} "

31860103," BACKGROUND The significance of vitamin D status may be an important modifiable risk factor to reduce falls and fractures.  Calcium and vitamin D supplements can reverse secondary hyperparathyroidism thus preventing fracture. The authors examined the effect of multivitamin and mineral supplementation on fracture incidence among older women with type 2 diabetes, and in a 3-year r and omized double-blind clinical trial. We used four-monthly oral supplementation using 100,000 IU vitamin D2 ( ergocalciferol ). As a main outcome measure, we used the incidence of fracture associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels < 50 nmol/L ( 20 ng/mL ). The date s, sites, and causes of the fractures were collected retrospectively.. The vitamin D and placebo groups had similar baseline characteristics. In intention-to-treat analysis, 205 first fractures occurred in the intervention group during a total of 2,846 person years of follow-up ( 7 fractures per 100 person-years ). Both groups received calcium citrate, 1000 mg/d. Fall data were collected every 6 weeks. In the study population, the hazard ratio of having at least 1 fall over 1 year after adjustment for baseline height, which was significantly different between the 2 groups ( r = 0.67 ), and the st and ard-dose group had 1.11 ( 95 % CI 1.51, 2.87 ). We also investigated whether eldecalcitol treatment affected levels of serum 25(OH)D, serum 1,25[OH]D, and albumin-corrected calcium...

29596560," Objective : In addition to a preoperative antibiotic single-shot prophylaxis, we tested the impact of a one-time preoperative water-filtered infrared A irradiation ( wIRA ) on postoperative wound healing in patients. This r and omized controlled trial was conducted at a surgical centre. Inclusion criteria were English-speaking patients over 18 years booked to undergo elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The study included 130 patients, the control group ( 20 patients ), and the experimental group ( 25 patients ). The control group received topical petrolatum-based ointment ( group B ). Primary endpoints were surgical site infections ( SSIs ), wound healing, and rate and level of pain within 30 days after surgery. The relationship of hypothermia and of other confounding factors, such as diabetes mellitus, antibiotic treatment, and wound drains with infection outcome was evaluated. The primary outcome data of interest were objective, observational measures of wound healing... Surgical wound healing was significantly correlated to their contents in Fe, Cu and Zn, whereas no correlation was shown in group B. The incidence of SSI was 9 of 178 patients ( 5.1 % ) within group A compared with 22 of 182 ( 12.1 ) within the CG. Generally, most attention is paid to intra- and postoperative interventions to improve wound healing after surgery, while preoperative interventions remain unsatisfactorily explored. Objective : The results of this systematic review show that the beneficial effects of preoperative interventions on wound healing and scar formation have been summarized and compared."
22723585," The effect of dietary fructose ( 20 % of carbohydrate calories, 45 - 65 g day-1 for 4 weeks ) on glycaemic control, serum lipid, lipoprotein and apoprotein A-I and A-II concentrations and on insulin sensitivity was studied in 10 type 2 diabetic patients. The study was done in a r and omized, double-blind fashion with crystalline fructose or placebo administered evenly during 4 meals or snacks per day. The patients were hospitalized throughout the study periods. The fasting plasma glucose concentration decreased during the fructose ( from 10.7 + /- 1.4 mmol l-1 to 8.0 + / - 0.8 mmol l -1, P < 0.02 ) and the control diet (from 10.1 - /- 0.9 mmol l)  to 6.0 - /-- 0.7 mmol l--1,. The mean diurnal blood pressure concentration also fell both during  The fructose ( From 10.8 + /-) 0.5mmol l- 1 to8.0 +/- /-0.3 mmol l-)1. Greater body mass index, lower physical activity, and a Western dietary pattern were independent predictors of higher plasma C-peptide levels in the sample. A C-Peptide score, based on these variables, was positively related to risk of Western-related cancers, but not to other cancer types in patients. Insulin sensitivity increased by 34 % ( P <0.05 ) During the fasting diet, but remained unchanged during this control period. Serum insulin, triglyceride, apoproteins, the first decile, blood pressure and blood lactate remained unchanged after both diets. In conclusion, substitution of moderate amounts of fructose for complex carbohydrates can improve glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in humans is controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of controlled feeding trials to clarify the effect of fructose on cardiometabolic risk in individuals with diabetes."
26420387," BACKGROUND The effect of dietary calcium supplementation on risk of hip fracture  in postmenopausal women. We investigated the association between calcium intake and hip fracture incidence in a population of elderly women from Spain who were prospect ively evaluated during three years. This is the first population -based study to demonstrate the high frequency of vertebral fracture in elderly women. The participants were aged < 80 y at study entry ( mean age : 61 y ), were generally healthy, and had a recent diagnosis of colorectal adenoma. The two groups were similar in baseline age, years postmenopause ( 3.3 in the calcium group vs 2.7 for the placebo group ). The outcomes were analyzed through Cox proportional-hazards regression with adjustment for potential confounders. The primary outcomes of this cohort was only slightly lower than placebo.. The secondary outcomes were all fractures and total hip fracture ( RR = 2.4, 95 % CI : 1.7, 3.5 ), and among them 3871 ( 6 % ). Incident falls and fractures were ascertained every year. We observed 81 osteoporotic fractures ( 27 % ) and the majority of fractures. The low relative risk observed among men, although interesting, must be interpreted cautiously due to small sample size. The crude rate of a first fracture of any type was 17.2/1000 person years at risk ( HR ), 1.90 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.04 - 3.46 ),. The adjusted hazard ratios ( RR ) for any non-vertebral, hip, forearm/wrist, and humerus fractures were 1.31 ( 1.15 - 1.49 )... We found the evidence underpinning recommendations to increase calcium intake through dietary sources or calcium supplements to prevent fractures."
27416628," BACKGROUND Observational studies suggest high prenatal vitamin D intake may be associated with the development of allergic diseases. However, scientific evidence for this is conflicting. The aim of this study was to examine the association between early exposure to solid foods in the infant's diet and the incidence of  eczema up to 4 years of age. We conducted an etiologic case-control study nested in two studies - the PIPO cohort ( Prospect i ve Cohort on the Influence of Perinatal Factors on The Occurrence of Asthma and Allergies ). In this cohort data on nutrition, environmental exposures and parent-reported eczema were collected prospect ively starting from 5 months pregnancy by means of question naires administered during two home visits and semi-annual postal questionnaires. In addition, detailed information about the timing of introduction of solid foods at individual food item level was collected at 6 months. RESULTS : The relationship with wheeze and any allergic disease remained statistically significant in multivariate analysis, and there was also an inverse linear relationship between copper and food allergy.. The heterogeneous nature of breast-feeding effects suggests it may influence systemic immunoinflammatory function at several different levels. The paper refers to the recently published empirical data on infant eczema ( 18/171 ; 10.5 % ), and in early infancy.. There was no significant difference in atopy, eczema risk, lung function or exhaled nitric oxide between supplemented groups and controls. Conclusion Prenatal vitamin D supplementation in late pregnancy that had a modest effect on cord blood vitamin D level, was not associated with decreased wheezing in offspring at age three years. The evidence from two trials, involving 523 participants, did not observe a significant protective effect of maternal antigen avoidance during the first 18 months of life."
25767138," The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether strength training is a useful addition to aerobic training in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ). Strength training increases muscle strength and muscle mass, but there is an ongoing debate on the additional effect concerning the exercise capacity. We design ed and evaluated two simple, practical, and widely applicable upper-extremity training programs in 45 patients with COPD participating concurrently in a comprehensive, multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation program. After completing baseline measures, including muscular strength and the Senior Fitness Test, patients were r and omly assigned to the following three groups : ( 1 ) gravity-resistance ( ST ) or traditional PR program ( TR, n = 10 ). The training consisted of three weekly twenty minute exercise sessions without ( P1 - P3 ) or with supplemental oxygen ( P4 - P6 ). Baseline and after-training measurements of peripheral muscular strength, maximal exercise capacity, and 6-min walking distance were obtained. RESULTS Strength increased in both RT ( P <.05 ) and decreased in  ET for both upper and lower body. Functional fitness improved ( P<0.05 ) in 5 of 7 tests for RT compared with 2 tests in the ET group. CONCLUSIONS Single set RT can elicit significant improvements in both strength and functional fitness, which is not obtained by traditional ET. The short term inpatient training ( RT ) is thought to be effective in improving the quality of life ( HRQoL ), compared with the control group ( p < 0.001 ). In the 6MT, there was a significant difference in mean percentage change in physical functioning between the AERO group and ET group ( 3 + /- 6 % and 2 +.05..A+-R)/ and ).."

Because ADHD is not new, the additional influence of neurofeedback ( NF ) on children with ADHD ) to treatment is unclear. The final sample consisted of 23 children and omized, placebo-controlled study was design ed to assess the effects of theta/beta training and training of slow cortical potentials, ( SCF ), either immediately or after a 6-month wait ( waitlist control group ). Results : Experts in NF, ADHD, and teachers completed question naires pre- and postintervention. In two school years, 39 participants were recruited and 34 ( 87 % ) completed all 40 treatments. Child/parent guesses about treatment outcome were no better than chance. At Treatment 24, 38 % chose 2X/week and 62 % chose 3X /week. Primary outcome was severity of ADHD symptoms on the ADHD Rating Scale IV, scored at baseline, during treatment, and at study end. The combined therapy was not significantly different in the two groups. Evaluation ('placebo » ) scales were applied to control for parental expectations and treatment effects. A large double-blind RCT is feasible and necessary to determine whether Electroencephalogram-neurofeedback ( EEG-NF ) significantly improves the overall symptoms, inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity dimensions.. A systematic review of the current literature also did not find any systematic beneficial effect of neurofeedback training. The EEG-NFs.. The current study shows that neurofeedback treatment for ADHD.

27405704," Background : Genetic testing for obesity risk is increasingly available to the public but few studies have examined whether the information can positively impact health behaviors and aid in chronic disease prevention. This study examined potential behavioral consequences of such testing. Methods A double-blinded, parallel group, 2∶1 online r and omized controlled trial was conducted to determine the impact of genetic risk prediction of obesity, diabetes and CVD, followed by either genetic test results ( CR+G ; N = 303 ) or control group. We aim to evaluate short-term effects of providing different types of information about coronary heart disease ( CHD ) risk, alongside lifestyle advice, on health-related behaviours. Results : Participants were recruited from the Coriell Personalized Medicine Collaborative, an ongoing, longitudinal research cohort study design. They responded to both higher- and average-risk vignettes ( P = 0.023 ). Participants who received their results in-person were at a higher stage of change than controls ( P < 0.003 ). The results suggest that personalized diets may successfully modify elevated postpr and ial blood glucose.. Individuals with low perceived behavioral control or an external weight locus of control who were told to imagine they were at average risk expressed significantly lower intentions to eat a healthy diet. A three-way interaction of body mass index, family history of diabetes, and genetic risk information ( 6.5 % high perceived utility.. The follow-up assessment takes place 12 weeks after discharge. The study shows that genetic risk communication does not affect the extent to which people feel they have control over a condition, and this understanding is of immense research interest."
25985235," In a double-blind, placebo study, acetyl-L-carnitine ( ALC ), a metabolite necessary for energy metabolism and essential fatty acid anabolism, might help attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ). Trials in Down's syndrome, migraine, and Alzheimer's disease showed benefit for attention. A preliminary trial in ADHD. A pilot study on 17 fragile X male treated with L-acetylcarnitinine ( LAC ) over one year, showed a significant reduction of their hyperactivity behaviour tested by the Conners Abbreviated Parent-Teacher Question naire. The observed frequency of the ACN treatment in ADHD patients derives from the hypothesis that the biochemical and physiological properties this substance has may preserve brain activity. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of LAC in a larger sample of FXS boys with ADHD. The study design was r and omized, double blind placebo controlled, parallel, and multicenter ( with eight centers involved in Italy, France, and Spain ). Sixty‐three FXS males with ADHD ( aged 6–13 years ) were enrolled ; 7 patients dropped out, 56 completed the one‐year treatment, and 51 were included in the statistical analysis. Both groups improved their behavior, showing that ADHD patients might present based on their FMR1 premutation carrier status. There was also a geographic effect ( p = 0.047 ). Side effects were negligible ; electrocardiograms, lab work, and physical exam unremarkable. CONCLUSION ALC appears safe, but with no effect on the overall ADHD population ( especially combined type ). It deserves further exploration for possible benefit specifically in treating ADHD in FXS children."
32382836," Introduction The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of a method of stapled haemorrhoidopexy ( SA ) with that of conventional haemorrhoidectomy. A great variation in the incidence of haemorrhoids, the feasibility of a very well-designed controlled trials ( RCTs ). The study was conducted between 2014 and 2015 on 25 patients with haemorrhoidal treatments, which are often inadequately reported in trials, thus limiting the value of these data. In this article, we aim ed to systematic ally review the available data. The treatment outcomes, postoperative pain, time until return to normal activities, type of haemorrhoidal disease. The following data were collected : Postoperative pain was rated by the patient for 14 days by using a ten-point visual analogue scale. The patients were r and omly assigned ( 1:1 ) to receive either traditional excisional surgery or stapled hemorrhoidopexy. The primary endpoint was relief of symptoms by 12 months based on a 2-point minimum improvement on VAS score and bleeding score. The postoperative pain score was similar in both groups. A better knowledge of hemorrhoidal vascular anatomy, demonstrating, how the arterial supply to the hemorrhoids crosses the rectal wall. Median ( range ) V.A.S. scores were similar between groups ( p = 0.093, Fisher ’s exact test ). After the operation, the majority of patients ( 66.7 % ) had the same postoperative pain. The incidence of complications was similar between the two groups. We adapted these principles and also minimized the number of patients with hemorrhoidal treatment. The outcomes were significantly better after the application of a single HAL compared with the double HAL. The recovery of haemorrhoid treatment was also higher for the single andAOC+/-.}90).,.  )"
24392600," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of a 6-month, empowerment-based diabetes self-management intervention for a sample of inner-city African Americans with diabetes. Study participants were r and omly assigned to the treatment ( 26 ) and control ( 21 ) conditions. The results indicate that treatment group participants were more likely to achieve positive outcomes in terms of lowered hemoglobin A1c, and body mass index measurements than were control group members. These findings support the development of telehealth interventions to promote effective chronic disease management in medically underserved communities. During the control period, participants received weekly educational newsletters, the effectiveness of different behavioral interventions in one of the most high risk population s, African Americans, remains unclear. Our systematic review identified and examined findings of published behavioral interventions targeted at African Americans to improve glycemic control. The goal of our study was to distinguish which interventions were effective and identify areas for future research."
25142703," OBJECTIVE To determine the feasibility and efficacy of a physical activity behavioural change intervention in managing cancer-related fatigue. This study examined whether an Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia ( CBT-I ) could be beneficial in counteracting major symptoms of this devastating syndrome. A two arm, single blind, r and omised controlled trial was conducted within the Northern Irel and regional Cancer Centre. Evaluation included an NP test battery and self-report question naires assessing symptoms, including cognitive complaints.. The primary endpoint was the general subscale of the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory ( MFSI-SF ), the ( 2 ) fatigue and ( 3 ) vigor subscales of  the Profile of Mood States - Short Form ( POMS ), and ( 4 ) the Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ). Data were analyzed using repeated- measures analysis of variance. RESULTS Compared with patients receiving placebo, those patients treated with therapeutic CPAP showed significant reductions in the apnea-hypopnea index, as well as decreases in both measures of fatigue and increases in vigor ( P values < 0.05 ). The study showed that the overall fatigue was a subjective complaint that is believed to be multifactorial in its etiology and multidimensional in its expression. The sample comprised 475 patients. This bias was not observed for the other outcomes. The majority of patients in this study were able to show that a treatment, such as celecoxib, addressing a single target, albeit very important as fatigue, could have positive effects. The results suggest that 3 weeks of t'ai chi treatment may be experienced by individuals in different dimensions as physical, mental, and emotional tiredness."
29856237," BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Limited evidence exists on the benefits of individualized care for improving stroke survivors and their risk of recurrent stroke. We investigated if tailored smoking cessation advice would yield a higher smoking cessation rate and a higher rate with sustained abstinence in the intervention group than among controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients admitted with an acute stroke or a transient ischaemic attack were included to a r and omized controlled trial with blinded assessment of outcomes and intention-to-treat analysis. Patients were randomized to either nurse-led, telephone-based follow-up ( intervention ) or usual care ( control ).  BP and LDL-C measurements were performed at 1 month ( baseline ) and 12 months post-discharge. The intervention group patients who did not meet target values were compared using a global and closed hypothesis testing strategy. Outcomes fell into 5 domains : ( 1 ) neuromotor function, ( 2 ) institution time or death, ( 3 ) quality of life, ( 4 ) management of risk, and ( 5 ) stroke knowledge and lifestyle. RESULTS At 12 months, mean systolic BP, diastolic BP, self-perceived health, and not being exposed to smoking at home ( P =.05 ).

The objectives of this study were to document the effects of age on and rogen concentrations in women with t(X-Aut ). In the second group estradiol was replaced transdermally from the 2nd postoperative day ( testosterone, and rostenedione and 17-hydroxyprogesterone ( DHEAS ) ). The 1st group ( n = 36 ) and 2nd group of women - treated with estrogen, had a significant decrease in the testosterone levels. The study was by linear regression for total T, and testosterone. The results show that the majority of women who tested positive for adrenal cortex autoantibodies and that all women tested negative for ovarian function.. In multiple regression analyses on log-transformed hormones, the concentrations of DHEA, and DHEAS were negatively and statistically significantly associated with age ( both β = −0.03, P < 0.001, respectively ).. Women with premature loss of ovarian function, such as primary ovarian insufficiency ( POI ) or iatrogenic menopause may be at increased risk for diminished testosterone concentrations. The association with the whole age range of women with premature ovarian failure, increasing by more than 2-fold ( 7.41 + /- 3.86 % ), whereas those in DHEA and DS were not age related. The time x between- and within-group interaction effects on plasma DHEAS levels of postmenopausal women were similar in both groups. The current meta- analysis was conducted to evaluate current literature reporting serum total testosterone values under these conditions, including stratification for various testosterone assays."
29760253," BACKGROUND Benzodiazepines are the most frequently used drug for the treatment of insomnia. The usual clinical management of benzodiazepine dependence is gradual tapering, but when used alone this method is not highly effective in achieving long-term discontinuation. We compared the efficacy of a direct-to-consumer educational intervention against usual care.. The primary outcome was whether or not patients received treatment as usual ( taper only ). The participants were assessed clinical ly and psychologically and had weekly sessions of behavioral therapy. The subjects who received placebo had more symptoms, assessed their symptoms as more severe, and stopped taking the study drug at a higher rate than those receiving the intervention. The outcomes in both the CBT and the control group were equivalent. In period 1, patients received ( double-blinded ) melatonin ( 2 mg in a controlled-release formulation ) or a placebo. The main outcome measures were the percentage of patients who reported a withdrawal syndrome, the duration of withdrawal, and psychological distress. The study showed that a high-baseline level of psychological distress, anxiety and dosage predicted a poor outcome. The addition of a self-help treatment focusing on benzodiazolepine use, and that immediate substitution is the best method. The results obtained from the placebo group were similar to those of the group.

Blood pressure, heart rate, and the number of withdrawals were recorded. After a placebo run-in period the patients received either placebo or imidapril 2.5 mg ( n = 29 ). The mean decreases in systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were greater with placebo than with placebo. The dose-response curve flattened after 8 weeks of treatment with placebo, and after 4 and 8 weeks active therapy. The overall mean baseline SDBP was 103.4 mm Hg ( s.d. 0.62 ) in the placebo group. The 24-h UAE was lowered to normotensive levels with an optimal response being achieved at a dose of 10 mg/day... The combination of ACE inhibitors and placebo significantly reduced systolic and /or diastolic BP lowering efficacy of enalapril. The peak/trough ratio after 10 mg compared with placebo was similar to the treatment of hypertension. A better antihypertensive efficacy was obtained with the fixed combination captopril 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg versus placebo.

10789614," BACKGROUND The role of Helicobacter pylori in non-ulcer dyspepsia ( NUD ) is unclear. The aim of this population -based study was to determine whether the prevalence of H. pylori infection is higher among patients with gastric ulcer and 35 % to 86 % of patients with duodenal ulcer. Forty-one patients with NUD were studied in a prospectively designed study with bismuth subcitrate ( CBS ), two tablets twice daily for 4 weeks. The severity of gastritis was recorded before and after treatment by means of visual analog scales. The patients in both treatment arms showed improvement in clinical scores for abdominal pain, heartburn, and diarrhea. The other part was cultured using Skirrow ’s agar microaerophilically.  Conventional microflora and C. pylori were examined in gastric contents of some cases. The median age was 28 years ( range : 21 - 81 ). The majority of patients ( 66 % ) were infected with Helicobacter pylori, and at the end of 2nd, 6th, and 12th months. The study showed that the incidence of H pylori infection was higher in patients with gastritis. No change was seen in patients in whom the bacteria was not eradicated. The prevalence increased with age and with the duration of gastritis... The incidence of bacterial infection was lower in the group with H pylori. At the same time, the patients had the following: Conclusion: The study confirms that chronic infection with Hpylori infection with diarrhea, and about any benefits of antibiotic treatments for nonulcer or uninvestigated dyspepia.

26104189," Background The purpose of this study was to compare a technology-based system, an in-person behavioral weight loss intervention, and a combination of both. We investigated the effectiveness of an intervention that objective ly and accurately measures free-living energy balance and sleep and includes software for self-monitoring of daily energy expenditure and energy intake. The study was a theory-guided, controlled trial conducted from April to December 1999. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Ninety-one healthy adults ( age, 46.8 ± 10.8 y ; body mass index ( BMI ), 33.3 ± 5.2 kg/m2 ). All participants received 1 weight loss group session, coupons for meal replacements, and access to an interactive Web site. The intervention group was r and omized to a test group that received a diet and physical activity monitoring application ( app ). The control group received an online personal activity monitor ( Gruve Solution ™ ), and the computer-automated feedback group received automated, tailored messages. RESULTS Retention was 82 % at 3 months and 80 % at 6 months for all 3 groups. At 3 months, completers in the behavior therapy group received additional behavioral procedures, including a sequence of 24 weekly behavioral lessons via e-mail, 3.4+/-3.4 kg, and 6.2+/-4.0 kg, for the intervention group, respectively. The distance output of the Fitbit One activity monitors  was significantly different from the criterion values for each monitor at all speeds ( P <.001 ) and exhibited poor concordance ( 0.0 - 0.05 ).

METHODS Forty-eight patients with fibromyalgia, selected from a rheumatology out-patient department and from members of the Dutch fibromyalgia patient association, were pre-r and omized into either a treatment group or a control group.. Subjects were tested at baseline and at 6, 12, and 23 weeks. Tests included the Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ), SF-36, the 6-minute walk test, and the Grippit measure. In both groups, pre- ( week 0 ) and post-treatment ( weeks 12 and 24 ) evaluation was performed by the same investigator. The primary outcome was pain [ visual analog scale ( VAS ) ]. Other endpoints were the number of tender points, total myalgic score ( dolorimetry ), and pain. The results showed that the group time interaction was significant at week 15 compared with baseline, with an average 36 % reduction in pain intensity. In addition, the overall improvement in QOL was significant.. The benefits of our program did not appear to be due to exercise or education since both interventions were given to patients. CONCLUSION The treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ), however there has been limited evaluation of its effectiveness. The aim of this systematic review was therefore to examine the efficacy of hydrotherapy in the management of FMS."

A catheter-based strategy is therefore widely attractive, but the impact of gender on AF patients taking aspirin. A sub analysis of 7,406 patients with AF and a risk of stroke to receive, in a blinded fashion, fixed doses of warfarin.  Stroke rates were also determined in another cohort free of CVD ( n = 14,267 ).  Total medical costs after hospitalization were available from a 1991 cohort. The primary outcome was the incidence of stroke ( ischemic or hemorrhagic ) and stroke or death. The trial was design ed to test for noninferiority, with key secondary objectives of testing for superiority.. During follow-up 33 patients had major bleedings ( rate 1.37 x 100 pt/yrs ) but no difference was found between genders in bleeding risk... The incidence of thromboembolism, total mortality, and the rate of the composite outcome were similar between genders. The occurrence of stroke was high in women ( 6.8 % in women vs 0.7 % in men ; P = 0.027 ). A risk score for stroke was derived that included the following risk predictors : advancing age, female sex, increasing systolic blood pressure, and diabetes. The rate of major bleeding was higher in women with AF ( RR, 0.4 ; 95 % CI.. ), and female patients had higher scores than men ( P=0.003 ).. With the use of these variables, a risk stratification scheme for the recurrence of AF after the first ablation  in female rather than in male patients.. Atrial fibrillation is the most common supraventricular arrhythmia. Its prevalence increases with age and preferentially affects female patients. Over 75 years of age, the absolute number of patients affected is similar between sexes.. Although the present systematic review theoretically and.).  .

The mean follow-up was 5.2 years ( 1 to 10 ). Clinical and radiological assessment was carried out pre- and post-operatively. At five years, the mean Knee Society knee and functional scores had increased significantly from 56.2 ( 30 to 91 ) pre-operative to 87.8 ( 59 to 98 ) ( p = 0.034 ). A total of 95 patients were men and 78 were women. Their mean age at surgery was 67 years ( 38 to 89 ) and mean body mass index 29.87 kg/m2 ( 17 to 62 ). We found little or no difference in outcomes between the 2 procedures. The most common reasons for re-operation were arthritis in the lateral compartment ( 2.5 %, 25 knees ), bearing dislocation ( 0.7 %, seven knees ) and unexplained pain ( 0.5 % ). There was no total mortality. The hip-knee-ankle ( HKA ) angle showed significant positive correlation ( r=0.82, p<0.001 ) with only the medial knee osteoarthritis ( OA ). With appropriate patient selection, UKAs are a successful option for patients with medial knee OA."

After oral administration of lipiodol ( 0.5 ml ), three treated groups of mother-newborn couples were compared to an untreated group : group A, mothers treated 1 - 3 months before conception ; group B, mothers with treated during the first month of pregnancy ; group C. In both groups the incidence of goiter and iodine-stimulating hormone levels were similar and did not change throughout pregnancy. The iodine excretion at the second trimester in the group and treated group was significantly ( p less than 0.01 ) higher than that of group B ( 100.0 + /- 39.0 versus 50.0 - /- 37.0 micrograms iodine per 24 hours, respectively ). Initially, the maternal milk and urinary iodine and serum-free thyroxine levels were significantly higher after treatment. At the end of pregnancy, no difference was found in total iodine content in group A. In women receiving a placebo, two cases of excessive thythyroid stimulation worsened as gestation progressed, with low free T4 levels, markedly increased serum TG and T3/T4 ratio. Their re-evaluation confirmed that hypothyroidism was transient. Groups A, B and C were statistically different from group D with regard to neonatal thyrotrophin and thyroxine. Positive correlations were found between neonatal urinary thyroxine and birth weights and placental weights on the one hand and, and maternal dietary iodine supplementation, to avoid the risk of maternal and fetal hypothythyroidism.

26882490," BACKGROUND Sildenafil is a highly selective phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor for the treatment of erectile dysfunction ( ED ). They received testing dosage starting from 5 µg with increasing dosage ( maximum 20 µg ) to achieve a rigid erection of Schramek's grade 5 and lasting for at least 20 min. We investigated the efficacy of percutaneous perineal stimulation in patients with ED due to SCI. Following a 4-week observation period, patients received oral sildenafil  ( 25, 50, or 100 mg ) or placebo. In a 12-week, flexible dose-escalation study, 329 different men were treated with sildenafil or placebo, with dose escalation to 100 mg based on efficacy and tolerance. RESULTS : Compared with placebo, sildenafil produced higher levels of successful sexual stimulation, intercourse success, satisfaction with sexual life and sexual relationship, erectile function, overall sexual satisfaction, and an improved Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction score, with no clinical ly relevant effects onvital signs. However, in the dose-response study, increasing doses of sildenafil were associated with improved erectile Function ( P values for increases in scores for questions about achieving and maintaining erections were < 0.001 ). For the men receiving 100 mg of sildenafil, the mean score for  the question about achieving erections was 100 percent higher after treatment than at base line ( 4.0 vs. 2.0 of a possible score of 5 ).

20012073," The total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) was conducted to quantitatively measure the relative muscle torque strengths in 20 consecutive women with unilateral osteoarthritic hips and 20 consecutive men with unilateral osteonecrotic hips before and after the operation. The gait was determined with radiostereometry analysis with baseline when the patients still were anesthetized. The mean migration rate and the incidence of late aseptic loosening were both greater in group 1. Between February 1996 and February 2000, 43 consecutive patients ( mean age 53 ( 41–63 ) years, 23 women ) with hip osteoarthrosis received an uncemented and hydroxyapatite-coated prosthesis with an anteverted stem. The average peak load on the operated leg at one week was 39.0 kg for the UWB and 25.8 for  the PWB group ( P = 0.009 ) while at three months 70.0 and 31.7 ( P < 0.05 ). The patients in the partial weight bearing group were equipped with a robotic system for gait analysis. The muscle strength increased in both groups up to six months but there were no differences between the groups. RESULTS There was a statistically significant improvement in all measures of self-perceived function, muscle strength ( hip flexors, 24.4 % ; hip extensors, 47.8 % ; and hip abductors, 41.2 % ). At 1-year follow-up, the mean migration was –0.17 mm ( -2.18–0.21 ) and -0.28 mm, respectively. The rehabilitation programs for THA are becoming increasingly popular to shorten hospital stay and to facilitate rapid restoration of function.

The intervention group received a 1-year intervention design, with follow-up for an additional year without intervention. The study participants ( n = 47 ) were randomized to receive 250 ml ( 8 oz ) per day of a sugar-free, artificially sweetened beverage ( total 1800 kJ/d ) and the other group consumed 4 × 250 ml aspartame. At baseline, body weight and composition were determined, a 240-min oral-glucose-tolerance test ( OGTT ) was administered, and measurements were made of appetite and selected hormones.. During the intervention, the 0-mg/d ASP group was reduced to 74 % of the initial values with respect to placebo ( P<0.001 ). The participants weighed 1·72 ( se 0.47 ) kg less than the value predicted by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK ). There was an ongoing debate about the possible influences of weight loss and insulin resistance... We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of n = 6 and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) with NNS. The reported daily energy intake did not increase significantly, and sucrose supplements significantly reduced the reported voluntary sugar, starch and fat intake  compared with placebo. There were no significant influences of nonnutritive sweeteners ( NNS ) on weight or BMI. The results of this study suggest that sucrose and diet cola may cause further weight loss during a 12-month period. and.)."
29189928," OBJECTIVE To examine the role of television ( TV ) viewing and obesity, we examined the association between sedentary behavior and the development of obesity. The aim was to prospect i ve associations between sitting time and subsequent changes in body weight. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a r and omized crossover trial, 24 adults ( 49 % male ) between 21 and 35 years of age was followed over 1 year with repeated measurements taken every 3 months. BMI ( kg/m2 ) and percent body fat ( % BF ) were calculated based on anthropometric measurements and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. A multi-sensor device was worn over a period of 10 days to estimate total daily energy expenditure and time spent in different intensities. The study sample consisted of adults age 25 to 74 yr at baseline who also attended site measurement at three time points ( n = 3261 ). The association was significant among those who were sitting < 4 hours/day ( aOR = 1.24 [ 95 % CI, 1.07 - 1.44 ].. Over the four year follow-up period, middle-aged men who increased their exercise , decreased  TV viewing  and stopped eating between meals , lost an average weight of −1.4 kg ( 95 % confidence interval (CI)−1.6 )..  Time spent watching TV was positively associated with changes in waist circumference ( P < 0.001 ).

For the in vitro part of the study, 60 extracted premolar teeth were divided into 2 groups of 30 each, equally divided in four different groups. Brackets were bonded in vivo by the same operator using a split-mouth r and om technique. Shear bond strength tests were carried out in vitro using the universal testing machine on one group of 30 tooth ; group 2, 37 % phosphoric acid + primer + precoated brackets ( group C ). The bond strength was measured after 14 days of thermocycling and tested for internal consistency ( Kuder-Richardson 20 ), test-retest and inter-rater reliability ( Spearman correlation coefficient and sign rank test ; kappa statistics ), criterion validity. The remaining 6 groups ( 3 for each adhesive ) were cured with the xenon arc light for 2, 5, and 10 seconds. After bonding, all sample s were stored in distilled water at room temperature for 24 hours and subsequently tested in a shear mode on an Instron universal tens machine ( Instron Corp, Canton, Mass ). Although the bond strength varied between the conventional etching and primer, there was no increase in bond strength recorded in vivo."
24217903," BACKGROUND Adult GH deficiency ( GHD ) is characterized by abnormalities of serum lipoprotein profiles and insulin sensitivity. The patients were r and omized into a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of human recombinant GH replacement therapy for 6 months ( period 1 ). We aim to evaluate the effect of GH replacement on the incidence and the risk stratification of these patients. The effects of long-term GH replacement in adults with GHD, taking into account the consequences of increasing age. We have examined this possibility during prospect i ve follow-up of adult onset GH deficiency. : Patients were prospect ively followed for 2 years in the study and on completion of the trial.  Body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.. The mean initial GH dose of 0.55 ( s.e.m. 0.03 ) mg/day was gradually lowered to 0.40 ( 0.01 ). The clinical events were compared to those obtained in 20 healthy sex- and age-matched controls... Mean GH replacement was increased and remained elevated throughout the 6 months, whereas the plasma aldosterone concentration was unchanged. Mean IGF-I sd score increased from -4.5 to -1.4.. Clinical signs of cardiovascular risk were increased in GH deficiency, the insulin sensitivity ( P<0.001 ), and reduced total and LDL-cholesterol.. Univariate analysis indicated that GH replacement ( 2.29 [ 1.86 - 2.82 ] ) and insulin resistance ( P=0.002 ). Mean lean body mass increased from 2.2 kg ( P = 0.004 ), to 4.8 ( 1.1 )..

Using a factorial design, we r and omly allocated patients to extended physiotherapy ( PT ) ( supervised 60 min/d during acute care plus an unsupervised home program ).  Initially the mean B.M.C. value for all epileptic patients was 87 % of normal. During treatment with 2,000 international units of vitamin D2.. We then gave the patients a large oral dose of 3 mg ( 120.000 UI ) of 25(OH)D3, and repeated the measurements after one month. RESULTS Basal 25[OH]D3 and Ad-SOS values were significantly lower, and PTH values significantly higher ( P < 0.0001 in all ), in the patient group. The low Ad- SOS values for the participants were independent of their treatment, but directly related to basal vitamin D levels ( r = 0.45, P<0.01 ). There was a negative association between PTH and 25(hydroxy)D₃ (. ).. Comparative analysis of BMDs were made between baseline, 1 year, and after 2 years of enrollment in this study. The incidence of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures was secondary end point. KEY FINDINGS Of the 80 patients initially enrolled, the majority of them ( 28 % ; 95 % CI, -4 % to 68 % ).

25409296," BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to determine whether the level of physical activity ( PA ) is associated with body composition, especially in adolescents. We aim to examine the association between PA, and body composition in a cohort of healthy adolescents aged 8 - 19 yr. DESIGN AND SETTING Baseline data from the Patient-Centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise Plus Nutrition Project. The proportion of body fat was assessed over 6 d in each girl using an accelerometer, and physical activity was self-reported at both time points.  Sum of skinfolds at age 11.3 years was highly correlated with BMI, and the percentage of fat mass was assessed by using the PAQ-C/A.  Physical training was assessed using a 24-h dietary intake question naire also completed two to three times per year. RESULTS None of the boys and girls were overweight at baseline, whereas the prevalence of high body fatness during adulthood was 29 % in men and 32 % in women. At the ages of 12 - 16 y, skinfold thickness was more strongly associated with adult body fatness than was BMI. At baseline, no differences were found in LM, FM, and FM% among the groups in the younger cohort. In contrast, the proportion of overweight among older children at follow-up was significantly associated with higher amounts of vigorous PA but not with the amount of moderate PA. Conclusion : Encouraging 10–12-year-old children to spend more time outdoors may be an effective strategy for increasing physical activity and preventing obesity. The study suggests that PA and BF in adolescence is not associated to body  fat ( BF ) and recommended as a way to reduce and prevent obesity."

28340030," OBJECTIVE To assess whether an Internet-based health management system using a customized health information technology, named ubiquitous (u)-healthcare, was helpful in achieving better glycemic control than routine care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A trial of 83 adults with type 2 diabetes, who were enrolled in a r and omized, controlled trial, to receive either supplemental computer multimedia use ( intervention ) or control ( glucometer transmission without feedback ). The intervention was composed of 4 modules : ( 1 ) data transmission module, ( 2 ) communication module, and ( 4 ) dietary evaluation module. The primary end points were the changes in glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ), blood pressure, diabetes knowledge, and other clinical ( blood pressure ) and laboratory ( lipid ) values. The other group received the same technologies, and their logbook data and A1C were monitored every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. RESULTS After the RCT, patients selected their monitoring systems and resumed usual care. The four result ing subgroups, defined by whether patients continued or changed monitoring systems, were reassessed after 26 - 65 weeks. The profile of the patient who benefited the most from the intervention group ( 9.2 + /- 2.2 %, 95 % CI -1.9, -0.5, P < 0.001 ). In 119/233 families ( 51 % ), someone visited the portal the first study year and 169/484 ( 35 % ) the second study year.. The u-healthcare system with voice inception technique was effective in achieving glycemic control without hypoglycemia, and children became more meticulous in diabetes self-care ( P = 0.003 ). CONCLUSIONS The combination of behavioral mobile coaching with blood glucose data, lifestyle behaviors, and patient self-management data individually analyzed and presented with evidence-based guidelines may help to improve diabetes management over time through systematic review and meta- analysis."
15846630," BACKGROUND : Lateral internal sphincterotomy is an effective treatment for chronic anal fissure. The most popular are anal dilatation ( AD ) and left lateral sphycterotomy. The aim of this study was to compare the surgical technique ( open vs. closed ). The patients were followed up for one month after the operation. RESULTS : All patients were treated by either open  ( group 1 ) or closed lateral internal tincteroplasty. The 2nd group had topical anesthetic cream ( xylocaine 2 % ). While the incisions of the patients in group 1 ( n = 22 ) were closed with two interrupted sutures, the incision was closed with one interrupted sutures. The mean values for operative time were 6.6 min for group 1 and 9.1 min for the group B. At 1 year three patients had failed to heal. Postoperative pain scores were similar between groups ( p = 0.284 ). Postoperative wound healing was similar between the subcutaneous ( 96.6 percent ) and open ( 94.4 percent ) groups. CONCLUSIONS : Operative techniques commonly used for fissure in ano include : anal stretch ( 16 males ; mean age, 45.1 years ) and to a lesser extent dermal flap coverage. The postoperative pain score was similar in the study group, including time to stoma proficiency, incontinence for gas, fluid or hard feces, during the day or night, and soiling. These reports are either subject to selection bias ( in non-r and omized studies ) or have inadequate numbers of patients enrolled to answer the question of efficacy."

31067200," Background : Recent research suggests that the sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) ) is associated with obesity and thought to be a factor in the development of hypertension. We previously found that obese, hypertensive patients with a body mass index ( BMI ) > or = 28 kg/m2 ( obese ) and nine lean individuals with a BMI < or = 25 kg/ m2 ( lean ) were recruited. This analysis sought to investigate the effects of atorvastatin, a lipophilic statin, and rosuvastatin, a hydrophilic statin. The primary safety outcome of major cardiovascular events ( type 2 diabetes ) was assessed to the extent of obesity and hyperinsulinemia, the control group. In this double-blind study, 924 participants were randomized to either the placebo, or the metformin, and were included in this study.. The outcomes of interest were the following. : Overfeeding result ed in 3.7 kg ( 95 % CI, 2.9‐4.5 ). The placebo group had a greater percentage of weight loss than DSE participants ( -6.15 % vs -0.88 % ; P < 0.001 ), and the original lifestyle intervention group was offered additional lifestyle support. The mean follow-up period of the study group was 7 + /- 1.6 vs 3.6 ± 0.6 mg/kg..., total MSNA ( 2.5 vs. 0.9 % ), type of obesity. The study showed that BMI was significantly higher in patients with heart failure than in healthy subjects. The modest weight loss with metformin treatment was not significant. The incidence of hypertension was present in 25 % of adults aged ≥18 years ( 39 % of men and 40 % of women ) were overweight and 13 % ( 11 % of subjects ) were obese. The World Health Organization states that overweight and obesity are associated with significantly decreased life expectancy. The Framingham Heart Study data have indicated that obesity and obesity have reached epidemic proportion, with the recent figures for those who are overweight and class I obese."
28380067," BACKGROUND Many breast cancer survivors experience the effects of Tai Chi, a low-impact mind-body movement therapy, on the severity of fatigue, psychological, and physical health of female cancer survivors.. The aims of the present study were to determine the prevalence of chronic fatigue in the general population of Hong Kong, compare health and lifestyle characteristics of non-chronic fatigue and chronic fatigue cases, and identify risk factors for chronic fatigue. METHODS We conducted a multicenter, r and omized controlled trial. Twenty patients with chronic and primary insomnia. Exercise group practice d breathing and walking as an exercise. Control group received usual care. The primary outcome measures were a change in total score of  the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory ( SF12 ). Secondary outcomes were dyspnea and fatigue levels, number of exacerbations and hospital admissions. RESULTS Fatigue is not only a familiar symptom in our daily lives, but also a common ailment that affects all of our bodily systems. The experimental group showed a significant ( P < 0.028 ) and clinical ly relevant decrease in pain intensity, which was equivalent to 0.6 million adults in Hong Kong. Both groups were found in females, older age groups, and low socioeconomic status. Fully adjusted stepwise regression analyses identified older age, retirees, higher HADS scores, depression and sleep dysfunction. More studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm the findings."
20459783," BACKGROUND. Existing data suggest that physical activity may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, but the role of moderate-intensity activity and the relationship to stroke risk are not well understood. OBJECTIVE To examine the association between current and past recreational physical activity and mortality  among older women.. We conducted a population -based case-control study of postmenopausal women who were identified from the Seattle-Puget Sound Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry.. The cohort included 931 incident cases and 1,552 controls.  Hazard ratios ( HRs ) for incident stroke were estimated for different levels of leisure time, occupational, and commuting physical activity.. : During a mean follow-up of 19.0 years, 2863 incident stroke events were ascertained. The multivariate-adjusted ( age, sex, area, transient ischemic attack, and cancer... ). The adjusted HR, comparing people who reported high versus no physical activity, was 0.86 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 0.78 - 0.95 ).. Mean age was 69.9 + /- 12 years ; 57 % were women, 18 % whites, 30 % blacks, and 52 % Hispanics.  Leisure-time physical activity  was significantly protective for stroke after adjustment for age, smoking, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and other covariates.  Participants with advanced neoplasia had a two-fold increased risk of not adhering to any of the selected lifestyle recommendations compared with controls. The risk reductions were similar for different types of activities, whereas in postmenopausal women, they were limited to occupational activity. Considering the dose-response relationship  to the total number of days of physical activity, the overall risk of mortality, and to seven chronic diseases ( cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus ) and osteoporosis ). A moderate physical activity level is shown to be associated with lower risk of breast cancer, total mortality, stroke, and overall health outcomes, and also the strength of this relationship between physical activity (..)... This systematic review examines critically the scientific basis for Canada's Physical Activity Guide for Healthy Living for adults."

28182680," OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of early experience on brain function and structure. In very preterm infants, abnormal sensory modulation is associated with behavioural and developmental disorders. This r and omized controlled trial involving 45 women with infants < 30-wk gestation, assessed the effectiveness of training parents  in reducing stressful experiences. Intervention consisted of 10 sessions in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ). The control group comprised of 33 term babies ( 18 boys, 15 girls ), born during the same period and location ( mean age 12.47, SD = 0.73 ).  The preterm infants were also evaluated with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition ( BSID-II ). RESULTS The Preterm infants exhibited more frequent behaviors indicating tactile defensiveness and difficult temperament than did the full-term infants... The mean number of painful procedures per neonate per day was 11.4 ( SD 5.7 ), significantly lower than the number of 14.3 ( SD 4.0 ) in 2001 ( p < 0.001 ).. Among all the explanatory variables only multiple gestations and head circumference contributed to the explained variance of participation ( 16 % ), and parents'satisfaction ( 13 % ). At age of 1 year, children born as late preterm are at increased risk of developing neurodevelopmental problems, and particularly those with cerebral white matter damage, whereas generalized decreases in thermal sensitivity but not in mechanical sensitivity suggest central ly mediated alterations in their neuromotor pathways, which may impact on responses to future pain or surgery. BACKGROUND Neurodevelopmental sequelae in preterm born children are generally considered to result from cerebellar processing problems in terms of registration, integration and modulation. The study demonstrates that quality of experience before term may influence the outcome of preterm infants and children..A). and. The present study aims to integrate available evidence on sensorsory processing problems and, in particular,-/"

We hypothesized that antihypertensive action of carvedilol when administered once daily and to investigate the pharmacokinetics of carvedilol in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. We studied 30 untreated hypertensive patients, aged 28 - 55 years, who were rotated through six 6-week periods of daily treatment with amlodipine 5 mg, doxazosin 4 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, bisoprolol, bendrofluazide 2.5 mg or placebo. The decrease in the latter was measured at the end of the rotation. Blood pressure readings and radial pulse tonometry ( by Sphygmocor ) were performed at each visit, and blood was taken for measurement of levels of atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ). The mean reductions from baseline systolic blood pressure for the bisoprolol groups were 0.6 ± 6.5, 7.3 ± 7.9, and 10.9 mm Hg ( ± SD ). A 73 % response rate was achieved with the low-dose formulation compared with 61 % for those who received placebo... Peak serum levels were 39 ± 27, 75 ± 38 and 161 ± 131 μ/L for carvedilol, compared with a 0.9 beats/min increase in heart rate for placebo group.. Carvedilol was well tolerated. Although beta blockers have been used as initial therapy for ischemic heart diseases, and heart failure, the beneficial effects of beta blockers are controversial compared with other antihypotensive agents. The present systematic review ( JSH ) 2019 Hypertension Guideline ( Clinical Question 6 ) was to assess the outcomes ( cardiocerebrovascular mortality, total cause mortality, hypotension, bradycardia, other adverse effects ) of currently used carvedilol and bisoprolol."
17253466," BACKGROUND Although cognitive-behavior therapy ( CBT ) is an efficacious treatment for generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ), there are waiting lists for secondary care. Interest has therefore grown in developing guidelines for treatment that would be feasible in primary care. The studies described here are, to our knowledge, the first to test the efficacy of CBT, in a group format, for patients with DSM-III-R defined GAD. METHOD Analysis of the 164 patients with GAD.. The outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. There was no spontaneous improvement during the baseline phase. Both groups showed improvement on anxiety measures following treatment, with the better outcome for the CBT group. The effectiveness of this treatment was also associated with outcome, suggesting the need for further research on this construct for underst and ing the nature of GAD. The proportion of patients in each category was also assessed at the end of treatment. The efficacy and effectiveness of psychological therapies as a group has not yet been evaluated in the treatment of GAD,. CONCLUSION All six groups averaged marked improvement ( pre-post effect size = 1.36 ). Treatment approach and degree of purity ( ), compared with treatment as usual/waiting list ( TAU/WL ), and compared with one another. The results obtained with these psychological treatments, categorised as CBT, psychodynamic therapist, and supportive therapeutic, were not significantly different in treating GAD. CONCLUSIONS Generalised anxiety disorder type 1, characterised by excessive worry or anxiety about everyday events and problems, is a highly prevalent condition. The utility of psychological interventions, categorised as cognitive behavioural apy ( CBT ), psychotherapy, psychotherapy plus psychotherapy, psychotherapy plus pharmacotherapy, and psychotherapy plus chemotherapy, as well as their effectiveness and effectiveness in improving treatment outcomes for GAD, are not yet fully understood.."
25109883," BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the effects of home-based resistance training on physical function, titled Strong-for-Life, and those recovering from injury.  EB training performed at low intensities by these population s may have little effect on muscle hypertrophy... The subjects were recruited from a  population -based survey of 883 elderly men and women living in New Mexico ( the New Mexico Elder Health Survey, 1993 - 1995 ) were analyzed to develop a method for estimating the prevalence of sarcopenia.  Functional performance was measured in the laboratory using the Physical Performance Test ( PPT ) and the Established Population s for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly ( EPESE ), with a 1-min rest between bouts.  Mean oxygen uptake during Kaatsu-walk and control-walk exercise was 19.5 ( SD 3.6 ) and 17.2 %, respectively. The patients'history of falls was also assessed before and after the 12-month follow-up.. Beginning from June 2000, the intervention group attended a 6-month program of fall-prevention exercise classes aim ed at improving leg strength, balance, and walking ability. the extent to which leg strength at 4 h post-exercise was greater than the control group. The study showed that the exercise group had significantly increased the rate of muscle strength in both sexes. The exercise program was significantly associated with self-reported physical performance in both men and female participants.. χ Home- based resistance exercise is commonly used for individuals who might not have access or the ability to use traditional resistance exercise.."
28787537," BACKGROUND Although it is widely accepted that the optimal blood pressure ( BP ) to < 140 mmHg in patients with hypertension, the magnitude of the discrepancy between trial population s and patients seen in community-based practice are not known. We have design ed a trial evaluating the efficacy of a strict treatment to maintain systolic BP below 140 mmHg ( group A ) and that of a mild treatment ( r and omized treatment ) or a target of less than 140 mm Hg (. The study design followed the Prospect i ve R and omize trial. The primary outcome was myocardial infa rct ion, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, and heart failure. The baseline characteristics of patients aged 60 years or more who achieved successful BP control with c and esartan, and who tolerated the treatment for at least 8weeks, were enrolled into the study and followed for 3years. RESULTS The primary and key secondary outcomes were death, cardiac disease, vascular disease, and renal failure. After a run-in period of 2 to 4 years, 2,165 patients were assigned to group A and 2,155 patients to Group B. There were no significant differences between the groups in sex, age, baseline BP, or other cardiovascular risk factors. The mean systolic BP was 7.2 mmHg lower ( p<0.0001 ) and 5.0 mmHg lower in the group with the highest follow-up BP.

26198702," BACKGROUND The role of probiotics in prevention of atopic diseases is still not clear. The optimal probiotic intervention regimen remains to be determined. In the hygiene hypothesis this study was to evaluate the effect of probiotic supplementation during pregnancy and early life on the development of eczema in infants. In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 62 mother-infant pairs, it is shown that administering probiotics to the pregnant and lactating mother increased the immunoprotective potential of breast milk, as assessed by the amount of anti-inflammatory transforming growth factor beta2 ( TGF-beta2 ), and Na/K ratios were analyzed in colostrum and mature milk obtained from mothers who had at least one first-degree relative ( or partner ) with atopic eczema. The possibility to modify gut colonization through probiotic supplementation in childhood might prevent atopic diseases. The primary outcomes were the incidence of eczema and point prevalence of atopy, using skin prick tests to common allergens. The mean total and specific IgE serum levels were also assessed. The prevalence of eczema ( 15 % in the probiotic vs. 16 % in placebo group ), allergic rhinoconjunctivitis ( 27 % vs. 20 % ), eczema ( 21 % compared with 19 % ). The frequency of atopic eczema was reduced significantly in probiotic group ( 15/64 [ 23 % ] vs 31/68 [ 46 % ] ; relative risk 0.51 [ 95 % CI 0.32 - 0.84 ]. The effect of L. reuteri on sensitization and IgE-associated eczema in infancy did not lead to a lower prevalence of atopic dermatitis at 2 years of age. The aim of the present systematic review and meta- analysis was that the beneficial effect of infant gut colonization with probiotics in preventing atopic diseases. The possibility of treating infants with probiotics.A. The potential benefits of probiotics during the early infancy were to improve the immune system."

We studied the association between the degree of inhibition of platelet function by aspirin... aspirin resistance, defined by platelet function testing and presumed clinical unresponsiveness to aspirin. The aim of this study was to determine prospect ively whether aspirin resistance in patients with acute coronary syndromes, the role of aspirin resistance on outcome in the follow-up and the effect of aspirin treatment on platelet function.. Methods — All subjects were screened for the incidence of aspirin-induced platelet aggregation.. Platelet function was tested by ( 1 ) serum thromboxane B2 ; ( 2 ) arachidonic acid ( ADP ) and platelet inhibition ( AA ). The primary outcome was the composite of death, myocardial infa rct ion ( MI ), and platelet activation. The mean resistance values of all patients were 484 ARU and < 39 %. All patients were on aspirin  with an average of 597 ARU, and 33 ( 62.3 % ) of 53 patients showed resistance to clopidogrel..

17312231," Background : Postoperative epidural analgesia is widely used to manage major abdominal surgery and postoperative pain.. The authors tested the hypothesis that epidural anesthesia and analgesia reduces the incidence of adverse cardiac events. We compared the effect of postoperative epidural anesthesia on the postoperative pain management techniques on postoperative recovery and those of intravenous morphine analgesia. Methods : A 5 % nationally r and om sample of Medicare beneficiaries undergoing surgery with one of nine defined comorbid states to identify high-risk status were studied. An epidural catheter was inserted between the second and third thoracic vertebral interspace ( Th2 to Th3 ). Analgesia was induced by epidural injection of bupivacaine 0.5 %. The primary endpoint was death at 30 days or major postsurgical morbidity. Analysis by intention to treat involved 447 patients assigned epidural and 441 control. Re source utilization parameters were compared for patients with and without PMII. Patients underwent the following index procedures : open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair ( n = 44 ), partial/radical pancreaticoduodenectomy (. ), partial/complete nephrectomy (... ). Postoperative pain intensity 30 min after analgesic administration was 5 or more out of 10, whereas there were no significant differences in postoperative morbidity, mortality, or readmissions, although 3 patients died in the open group.. Postoperative opioid analgesia was associated with a significant decrease in pain during movement and needed less morphine during the first 72 h after surgery ( 1.7 ± 9.9 vs 16.6 ± 8.1 mg ; P = 0.02 ).

30599499," OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA ( BoNTA ) injections into the detrusor muscle for treating neurogenic detrusor overactivity ( NDO ) in patients with spinal cord injury ( SCI ). MATERIAL S AND METHODS Adults with urinary incontinence ( n = 73 ) with SCI ( level T1 or lower ) with NDO and UI ( ≥14 UI episodes/week ) were enrolled. The patients with urodynamic detrusor overactivity, treated with intradetrusor injections of botulinum toxin ( BoNT-A ) or placebo. They were r and omised to receive a single dose of 200 U or 300 U, respectively. Patients were either resistant to anticholinergic medications, had discontinued treatment because of adverse effects, or had contraindications to treatment. RESULTS : In all, 64.3 % patients in the submucosa and 300 U ( n=91 ), and the patient's satisfaction with the treatment were assessed. The mean improvement in I-QOL total score at week 6 was significantly greater than baseline ( P < 0.001 ) and at 12 weeks ( P = 0.003 ). Significant correlations were noted between adherence rates measured by the 2 BTX-A groups ( Δ12.3 for 200 U and Δ14.9 for 300 U vs. placebo ). The procedure was generally uneventful, the mean was 0.2+/-0.41 ( p=0.003 ). The therapeutic effects sustained. The overall incidence of adverse events was low. In 11 patients receiving repeat injections of 300 U, the incidence of bladder overactivity was lower than placebo.

30616454," We present a match-paired study between computer-assisted and freeh and techniques using a short modular femoral stem ( Metha ; B. Braun Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany ) in  total hip replacement ( THR ). The use of navigation was ab and oned in 3 cases because of excessive pelvic tilt and unreliable registration of the pelvis. We compared postoperative adverse effects occurring in patients with the 3 anesthesia groups. The Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) score, Minimum Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) score and β-amyloid ( Aβ ) expression were calculated to determine the effects of different anesthesia on the postoperative pain and cognitive dysfunction of patients. Results The CEA and SEA groups had lower rates of perioperative adverse effects than in the GA group. Patients in this study were performed to compare the clinical efficacy between the OrthoPilot navigation system and conventional manual surgery. There was one intraoperative trochanter fracture that was not revised ( nonnavigated ) and one revision because of a periprosthetic fracture caused by fall down during rehabilitation ( navigated ). We conclude that acetabular implant positioning can be significantly improved by the use of navigated surgery technique. The data for postoperative limb length and global and femoral offset discrepancies were analyzed on magnification-corrected radiographs of both groups."
30177287," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intralesional interferon alpha-2b for the treatment of Peyronie's disease. MATERIAL S AND METHODS A total of 117 consecutive patients ( mean age 53 years, range 27 - 69 ) received interferon alpha 2b in an unr and omized prospect i ve study. The drug was injected subcutaneously adjacent to the plaque three times a week for 3 weeks at a dose of 2 x 106 IU. The effect of interferon-alpha 2b on the extent of penile deviation, plaque size and erectile pain were investigated, and the drug's side-effects were documented. The mean ( range ) follow-up was 22 ( 4 - 48 ) months RESULTS All patients had pain relief and 13 of 19 with pain before treatment became pain-free. The penile deviation was reduced in one patient ; the deviation increased despite therapy in one patients and remained stable in the others. Plaque size remained unchanged in all patients. Impaired sexual function was improved in seven ( 30 % ) of the patients. Side-effects ( myalgia, fever ) occurred after only four of 207 injections ( 2 % ). Qualitative data from these studies suggest a clinical ly significant effect of CCH and IFNα-2 b injection therapies to decrease penile curvature and conserve penile length. Penile blood flow improvement was observed in interferon alpha -2b treated patients but not in those who received placebo. The decrease in total number of penile vascular pathologies was significantly higher in IFN alpha- 2b cases. Studies of onabotulinum toxin A injections or thiocolchicine showed significant improvements in penile curvature, but only in studies of single-arm or case-control design. CONCLUSIONS This single-blind, multicenter, placebo controlled, parallel study demonstrates that intral fesional therapeutics have represented the initial conservative option with surgery being considered the definitive gold st and ard thertherapy. However, based on available data, strong conclusions can not be drawn for other treatments, including calcium channel blockers, HA, or mechanical therapsies. In this scenario, oral treattreatments for PD, and PDDU is a useful adjunct to monitor objective ly changes in penile vascular parameters."
26416579," BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Paraoxonase 1 ( PON1 ) is a high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) associated enzyme that is responsible for the protective effect of HDL against oxidation of LDL. The aim of this present study was to investigate the effect of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA ) reductase inhibitor atorvastatin on the serum PON1 activity and lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations. Methods : Ninety patients with mixed dyslipidemia were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into two groups : atorvastatin ( 20 mg per day for 4 months ), and placebo. The effect of atorvastatin treatment on lipid levels and the degree of DNA damage in lymphocytes separated from hyperlipidemic patients, nitric oxide ( NO ), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances ( TBARS ), PON levels and activity. All cases were subjected to thorough clinical examination and history taking and measurement of serum levels of HDL-PON1, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides, plasma paraoxonase activity and genotypes in both H and control subjects were determined at baseline. A total of 177 ( 50 % ), 142 ( 40 % ) and 37 ( 10 % ) subjects had Q/Q, Q/R and R/R genotypes, respectively. Baseline and final plasma levels of LDL -C, the ratio of HDL -C / total lipid, and PON1 activities were significantly decreased ( 20.5 ( 10.6–24.4 ) vs 24.8 ( 11.5–38.1 ). The atorvastatin group displayed a significant decrease in total hypercholesterolemia, LDL-cholesterol levels, and LDL susceptibility to oxidation. There was no significant difference in PON1 status ( p = 0.0001 ) and an effect of statin therapy on paraoxonase and arylesterase..

We assessed the effect of GH treatment on final height and height velocity during the first 2 years of treatment of children with short stature, with normal weight-to-Ht ratios, normal body proportions, and pathologic growth velocity. Subjects ( n = 68 ; 53 males and 15 females ), 9 - 16 yr old, and eight short untreated controls matched for age, and 20 short untreated girls who did not give consent for r and omisation. The girls received either GH ( 0.074 mg/kg ) or placebo sc three times per week until they were near adult height. At study termination, the mean total gain in height was 9.7 cm greater in the QD group ( 38.4 + /- 5.5 ) ; P <.001.. Adult height data ( SDS ) at 16.5 ± 2.1 years for the low-dose group and 16.1 ± 1.1 cm for those who received GH-treated group ( p = 0.62 ) were similar. The mean treatment difference ( SD ) was -1.06 ( SD 0.75 ), and -0.5 ( 6.4 ) cm, respectively ( P<0.05 ). The incremental effect of both doses on stature was minimal. The timing of each pubertal stage, and the difference between height SDS and predicted adult height ( 1.3 vs. 0.7 ), was not significantly greater than that of the observation group.

24808490," The effects of dietary fructose ( 20 % of carbohydrate calories ) on fasting serum cholesterol, the metabolic syndrome, and triglyceride levels were studied in 12 young men. The men were distributed into four groups, each of which was given a diet containing a different supplement. The four diets ( 500 kcal of carbohydrate each ) contained, respectively, sucrose, wheat flour, mixed fruits, and mixed vegetables. In one diet 45 g of carbohydrate was replaced by 45 g the placebo. The patients were hospitalized throughout the study periods. The results from the two groups were compared using repeated measures ANOVA.. In Type 1 patients the mean ( ±SEM ) fasting plasma glucose was 10.5 ( 1.8 ) mmol/1 and low in sucrose ( 2.5 E% ). There was no significant difference in serum cholesterol levels except for the vegetable diet, which produced much lower serum cholesterol than any of the other three diets. The serum phospholipids were also lower with the diet. The levels of insulin, body mass index ( calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared ), and fasting glucose were similar. The mean diurnal blood glucose concentration also fell both during the fructose ( from 10.8 + /- 0.5 mmol l-1 to 8.4 ± 0.6 ).. However, there was no convincing evidence of a causal relation between sugars and risk factors other than body weight. CONCLUSIONS We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials that examined effects of a variety of dietary free sugars on blood pressure and lipids. We conclude that a moderate amount of sucrose taken daily at mealtimes does not cause a significant increase in blood pressure or lipids, but there is no convincing relationship between dietary sugars and cardiometabolic risk factors. and.A+)./} -"
18029834," BACKGROUND To determine whether a home-based physical activity intervention can increase activity level, reduce caloric intake, and impact positively components of metabolic syndrome  in a disabled population. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine whether the addition of a pedometer to brief rehabilitation program could help patients increase their ambulatory activity. The present study tested the hypothesis that walking activity following the ACSM-CDC physical activity recommendation would lower BP in postmenopausal women with high BP. RESULTS : Participants received a brief physician endorsement of regular physical activity, a h and out the benefits of an active lifestyle.. The active group ( n = 13 ) was instructed to walk at least 10000 steps per day 5 or more days per week, for 6 weeks.  Data relevant to glycemic control and other parameters of health were collected at study weeks 0 and 6. There were no differences in the baseline activity between groups ( P =.36 ). The 10 K group wore a second pedometer for viewing their daily steps... During the intervention period, the participants increased their accumulated steps/day by 85 % to 9213, which result ed in significant decreases in BMI, waist girth, and resting heart rate. The intervention group experienced no change in BP at either 12 or 24 wk. The mean step count increased approximately 27 % above baseline ( P <.05 ), and the control group walked 10,159+/-292 steps/ day. The study showed that the pedometer use was not correlated with the change in BMI.. CONCLUSIONS To evaluate the association of pedometers as a motivational tool for motivating physical activity.. Although not statistically significant, pedometers have recently become popular as a tool to improve physical activity and health outcomes among outpatient adults."
21339335," Although GH replacement therapy is associated with alterations in body composition and a decline in functional status. Healthy older persons have decreased muscle mass, increased fat mass, and decreased strength. We assessed the role of plasma lipoproteins as predictors of risk and of treatment benefit in the elderly GHD patients. The effects of 2-yr GH replacement on muscle strength and neuromuscular function were followed in 24 elderly GHD adults ( mean age of 65.2 years ; range 61 - 74 years ). All patients had adult onset disease, and both groups were comparable in terms of the number of pituitary hormonal deficiencies, gender, body mass index, and waist/hip ratio. The mean IGF1 SDS increased from -1.10 at baseline to 1.17 at study end. GH replacement induced a sustained increase in lean body mass and a transient increase in isometric knee flexor strength. Isometric knee extensor strength was reduced after 10 years.. Serum insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) was measured at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks in all patients. Serum IGF binding protein 3 and acid labile subunit were measured at the same time points in 17 patients ( 8 male, 9 female ). For the prediction of TBK, TBW and BF, multiple regression equations based on BW, the dose of GH applied, and the age of patients were correlated with a more marked improvement in insulin sensitivity ( r = -0.68 ; P < 0.001 ). The efficacy of rhGH treatment was similar in young and old patients with GH deficiency ( GHD ). However, conflicting data are available on the efficacy of GH treatment in elderly GHD individuals.

24384894," BACKGROUND A significant proportion of lung cancer patients receive no anticancer treatment. This may be relevant in determining patient outcome after surgical procedures. A study was undertaken to measure a range of nutritional variables including dietary intake of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ATP on body composition, energy intake, and energy expenditure as secondary outcome measures in the same patients. RESULTS Patients with lung cancer, the Brief fatigue Inventory, The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung patients ( FACT-L ) and the  Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale ( ESAS ). Patients were assessed to determine the non-chance agreement among three oncologists rating 100 consecutive cancer patients.  Total unanimity was observed in 40 cases, unanimity between two observers in 53 cases, and total disagreement in seven cases.. In the 8-week treatment period, both intention-to-treat analysis and per protocol analysis revealed no statistically significant improvements in survival, tumor response rate ( < 10 % in both groups ) and overall survival, were not statistically different between groups. There were no differences between control groups in ASM/ht2 or lean mass. The overall prevalence of severe muscle depletion ( sarcopenia ) was 46.8 % and was present in patients in all BMI categories.. The differences between GNT and MNT were mainly due to a low BMI, and CTL/INS ( 19 + /- 5 ). There was growing awareness of the relationship between sarcopenia ( loss of muscle mass and function ), and outcomes in cancer, making it a potential target for future therapies. In order to inform future research and practice, we undertook a systematic review of factors associated with muscle mass, and of muscle function and muscle mass in lung cancer."
23419910," Background. Resistance training research has demonstrated positive effects for persons with Parkinson's disease ( PD ), but the number of acute training variables that can be manipulated makes it difficult to determine the optimal resistance training program. Objective. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the effects of an 8-week exercise program on strength and function in persons with PD. Methods. Eighteen men and women were r and omized to training ( knee extensors and flexors, ankle plantarflexion ) and /or balance training under altered visual and somatosensory sensory conditions, 3 times a week on nonconsecutive days. All participants were tested prior to and following a 12-week intervention period. The experimental group performed high intensity quadriceps contractions on an eccentric ergometer 3 days a week for 12 weeks. The active control group participated in an evidence based exercise program of PD. The outcome variables were quadricep muscle force, clinical bradykinesia measures ( gait speed, timed up and go ) and disease specific quality of life ( Parkinson '’s disease question naire-39 [ PDQ-39 ] ). Data was analyzed using separate 2 ( group ) x 2 ( time period ) ANOVAs. Results demonstrated significant time by group interaction effects for gait speed. The ICC for the total score was.56 ( 95 % confidence interval=.47-.65 ) for ratings by individuals, and the ICC for consensus ratings was.68 (95 % confidence Interval=.57-.76 ).

29191260," OBJECTIVE Physical activity improves function in adults with arthritis, but it is unknown if there is a grade d relationship between physical activity and functional benefit. This study was undertaken to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationship between self-reported physical activity ( OA ). METHODS The Osteoarthritis Initiative cohort included 2,589 patients with knee OA ( 2,301 with longititudinal followup data ) who were ages 45 - 79 years at baseline. Prospect i ve annual functional performance was assessed for 2 years using timed 20-meter walk tests.  We used linear regression to estimate differences across physical activity quartiles in subsequent function ( baseline and 1-year activity predicts 1-week and 2-year function, respectively ) adjusted for demographic factors ( age, sex, race/ethnicity, education level, and marital status ) and health factors ( OA severity, knee symptoms, knee pain, knee injury, body mass index, comorbidity, depression, smoking, alcohol use, and other joint pain ). RESULTS Increasing physical activity levels had a significant grade d related to functional performance. Adults in physical activity Quartile groups from least active to most active had an average gait speed of 4.0, 4.2, 4,3, and 4.5 feet/second, respectively, at baseline ( P for trend<0.001 ) and 4 and 3.3, 3.0... after 1 year (. increasing trends remained significant after adjusting for covariates. Findings were similar within sex and age groups. CONCLUSION These prospect i ve data indicate a consistent grade d role between physically activity level and better performance in adults who knee OA. These findings support guidelines that encourage patients with arthritis who can not attain minimum recommended physical activity to be as active as possible, and a vital sign tool ( indicator of general physical condition ) could alert providers of inadequate PA to prompt counseling or referral. This systematic review examined the use, definitions, psychometric properties, and outcomes of brief PA instruments as vital sign measures, with attention primarily to studies focused on arthritis."
31415611," Background It is possible that dietary saturated fatty acids ( SFA ) intake has been associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease ( CVD ), which was thought to adversely affect serum lipid profiles. To explore this issue further potential risk factors were assessed in subjects provided with each of six diets ( 50 kJ, 12 kcal ), followed 20 min later by 300 g mashed potato ( 908 kJ, 217 kcal ). In the two test meals, 60 g margarine were incorporated into either the soup or the mashed potato.. A comparison between dietary intake was assessed by a vali date d food frequency question naire.. Incident type 2 diabetes was ascertained until Dec 31, 2007, by a review of several sources of evidence. Gas chromatography was used to measure the distribution of fatty acids in plasma phospholipids ( mol% ). After each diet period, concentrations of serum lipoproteins, C-reactive protein, and insulin were measured. Results : When subjects consumed the high-oleic acid, low-trans semiliquid fat, intakes of stearic acid ( + 1.3 En% ), oleic acid ( 0.89, 0.79–0.99 ), and total fatty acids were measured to determine the effects of palm olein. In addition, after 2 wk into each period an 8 h postpr and ial challenge was initiated in a subset of subjects who consumed a meal containing 53 g of test fat. In conclusion, dietary fatty acids was found related to higher T2D risk ( 1.08, 1.01–1.17 ). When substituting SFA by proteins, the highest consumed vegetable oil in many countries.

30700025," Background To investigate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25(OH)D ) and the risk of all-cause mortality in very old ( ≥85 years ) men and women.. The authors conducted a nested case-control study within the prospect i ve Southern Community Cohort Study to determine the relationship between baseline serum vitamin D and mortality in the elderly.. We included 552 men and 584 women aged ⩾60 years who were free from CVD at baseline ( 1978 - 1980 ). During follow-up through 2006, 640 coronary disease deaths and 293 cerebrovascular disease deaths were identified. The models were fitted to the entire cohort, sex, age, enrollment site, and blood collection date. The odds ratios for quartile 1 ( < 10.18 ng/mL ) versus quartile 4 ( > 21.64 ng/L ). The hazard ratio for total mortality was 1.60 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.01, 2.14 ) for African Americans and 2.11 (95 % CI.. ) for non-African Americans. The effects were strongest for mortality. The adjusted hazard ratio ( HR ) for all cause mortality, 1.18 ( 1.09 to 1.28 ) for cardiovascular mortality.. There was no evidence that dietary vitamin D intake, PTH, or adjusted calcium were associated with the odds of death.. In the cohort study, vitamin D deficiency was not associated with increased mortality, but the lowest quartile ( 25[OH]D < 14.0 nmol/liter ), the corresponding adjusted HR = 1.56, 95 % CI 1.02 - 2.40 ). CONCLUSIONS : Epidemiological evidence suggests that Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of mortality for both African Americans, and that vitamin D levels are associated with decreased risk of death in this population.A.). and "

For the placebo group scores on all dimensions of the SF-36 and the QLSM decreased during the intervention year. The proportion of women who were reporting menopausal symptoms decreased from 25 to 20 %. The study was terminated on Dec 17, 2003. The prevalence of all symptoms except vaginal dryness decreased among intervention groups. In the estrogen group, the change in VMS frequency from baseline to 6 and 12 weeks ( mean difference [ yoga − usual activity ] from baseline at 6 wk, −0.3 ( 95 % CI, −1.1 to 0.5 ). As large numbers of women are choosing not to take HT, but a marked global decline in its use has result ed from concerns about the risks and benefits of HT. OBJECTIVES To examine the effectiveness of any type of exercise intervention on vasomotor symptoms in symptomatic perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, it is increasingly important to identify evidence -based lifestyle modifications that have the potential to reduce vasomotor symptoms."
28686645," BACKGROUND Circulating vitamin D status has been shown to be associated with hypertension. We planned to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of incident hypertension among patients with severe hypertension.. We therefore examined whether oral vitamin D deficiency and/or supplementation could reduce the incidence of hypertension in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Methods and Results : A single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in the Netherlands. The participants were r and omized to receive either 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 500 mg of calcium plus 200 mg of Vitamin D, or a placebo twice daily from the 15th to the 24th day of the cycle for 2 more years. The primary outcome was the difference in systolic pressure between baseline and 3 months. The multivariable relative risk estimates for the highest compared with lowest quintile of intake were 0.98 ( 0.93 to 1.04 ) in NHS II, and −4.0 mm Hg for 4000 U/d.

24514899," Background Statins are used to treat hypercholesterolemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, but many of these patients fail to achieve the target LDL-C level. In anticipation of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel IV guidelines, we wanted to evaluate the current state of lipid goal attainment in the high-risk secondary prevention population. The study was designed to compare the effect of ezetimibe 10 mg and atorvastatin 20 mg ( ), the statin dose can be increased.. The primary outcome was the first occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infa rct ion, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. The mean follow-up was 4.7 years. R and omisation to either 80 mg or 20 mg simvastatin daily was done central ly using a minimisation algorithm. The differences in total and LDL cholesterol reduction between the C5 + L20 and L40 groups were not significant. Similar changes and differences between treatments were seen in other lipid parameters.. In this r and omized, total cholesterol, non-HDL-C, Apo B and Apo A-I were greater with the placebo group ( P < 0.05 ) and in all active treatment groups... Lesser than. The LDLs were equally reduced with combination therapy vs. monotherapy in both age groups at 6 wk and in patients ≥ 75 years at 12 wk.. At 12 wk, more patients < 75 years were treated with statin than placebo. The changes in lipoprotein and apolipoprotein levels compared with baseline. In both groups, there was a significant decrease in these lipid levels in patients < 40 years of age.. Among patients with ASCVD, statins have often been used in combination with other lipid-modifying agents.. Clinical trials have demonstrated reductions in low-density liprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol levels ( 3 ) and is the leading cause of death for both men and women in  The 2013 American College of Cardiology ( ACC ) and the 2013 American Heart Association ( AHA ) guidelines recommend moderate- or high-intensity statin monotherapy as the next-line strategy for ASCVD risk reduction..

17988396," OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of a social marketing programme for distributing nets treated with insecticide on malarial parasitaemia and anaemia in very young children in an area of high malaria transmission. METHODS A quasi-experimental intervention study was performed in which 28,711 vouchers that gave free access to SRHC in 20 health centers, were distributed to adolescents. To evaluate the effectiveness, community sampling took place in markets, neighborhoods, and outside schools where self-administered question naires were distributed. The study comprised a r and om sample of 3,009 female adolescents, ages 12 to 20 years old, only unflavoured sachets were distributed free of charge through primary health care facilities. Using local perceptions of diarrhoeal disease management, the campaign in the experimental cell was carefully design ed and mass communication techniques employed and adapted accordingly. The treatment adherence rate among the patients in private clinics was 59 %. There were discrepancies between the reported management practice s of the PPs and what their patients actually followed. CONCLUSION The study identifies and highlights the need to educate PPs to improve the service quality improvements. Voucher use was associated with more frequent satisfaction with clinic reception, especially among sexually active girls not yet pregnant or mother ( AOR = 6.9 ; 95 % CI = 1.5 - 31.8 ). The private sector had a protective efficacy of 62 % ( 95 % confidence interval 38 % to 77 % ) on the prevalence of malaria, while the private sector represents an important source of care for all socioeconomic groups, including the poorest and disadvantaged population s. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by presenting the results of an economic analysis of private for-profit sector in health service provision in low- and middle-income countries. The privatesector represents an importante source of health service delivery for all socio-economic groups.-.)."

We conducted a pilot study that collected dietary, anthropometric, and sociodemographic data. The subjects were r and omly assigned to one of two groups to receive either a liquid ( E+:100 g/l, 1672 kJ ) or the supplement group ( 1,125 mg Ca++/d, CAL ). The main outcome was the change in BMI ( BMI = weight (kg)/height ( m2 ) ), while the rats in the cola group consumed more carbohydrates.. Results At 12 months, the mean body weight of the subjects drank 2 l of either E+ or E− beverages on the first day of both weekly periods, while only 169 articles ( 43.4 % ) reported ≥1 statistically nonsignificant relative risk in this period.. Changes in BMI, adjusted for gender and age, was not significantly different between the 2 groups.. The mean ( + /- SEM ) of BMI, was 0.10 ( 95 % CI : -0.01 to 0.20, P=.28 ), and the prevalence of overweight increased in both the intervention and control group. The net difference, −0.14 ± 0.21 kg/m2, was no longer evident. The BMI was not affected by the treatment.

The percentage of change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol and the percentage of patients achieving prespecified LDL cholesterol levels after 12 weeks treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg or from 10 to 20 mg. In this 6-week, multicenter, double-blind, trial, patients with hypercholesterolemia, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) and type 2 diabetes. The percent change in LDL-C and other lipids was assessed using a constrained longitudinal data analysis method with terms for treatment, time, and time-by-treatment interaction,. Subjects in the latter 2 groups who persisted with LDL cholesterol > 70 mg / total cholesterol or to receive atorvastatin 40 mg for 8 weeks, respectively. The mean age was 66.1 ± 10.8 years, 62.1 % were male. Atorvastatin at the dose of 10 mg plus atorvastatin, 20 mg, or both atorvastatin and simvastatin, respectively, that were not improved by 4 weeks of follow-up, than placebo. For measures of cholesterol goal achievement, treatment arms were compared using logistic-regression analysis.. The  mean atorvastatin dose at therapy start was significantly greater than did simvastatin 10 mg ( p < 0.001 ), whereas a slight increase was observed in those who received atorvastatin 10mg ( -22.50 % vs.-10.88 % ). The primary endpoint was a change in hs-CRP. In conclusion While statins are used as first-line treatments for hypercholesterolemia, statin monotherapy is often insufficient to achieve target low-dose lipoproteina ( LDL -C ), and atorvastatin monotherapy is significantly greater in patients with high-risk hypercholesterolemia, atorvastatin monotherapy, or double-titration of statin dose or switching to a higher-potency statin..

29397561," Background It has been demonstrated that statins can increase intestinal cholesterol absorption and reduces serum cholesterol levels when administered alone ( monotherapy ) and along with common lipid-regulating agents ( combination therapy ). In animals, ezetimibe treatment significantly reduced the concentration of atherogenic small, dense LDL ( sdLDL ), and markers of insulin resistance. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial in adult patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) and DPN, compared with placebo. The serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) and total cholesterol were significantly reduced at 4 and 12 weeks of treatment. This meta- analysis aim ed to investigate the effects of these two regimens on HDL-C, in monotherapy or in combination, on glycemic control. RESULTS : The subjects were type 2 diabetic patients who had failed to achieve the optimal LDL-cholesterol targets..  Lipid variables were compared with a primary focus on LDL -C, and with secondary focuses on the values of the parameters of glucose metabolism in all patients. The placebo group received the same treatments in reverse order. Subjects were requested to fast for at least 12 hours and then received a st and ard meal... The reduction of LDL cholesterol ( % ), the primary endpoint, differed significantly between the two groups ( -24.6 in EAT vs. -10.9 in DST ).. In the analyses, the effect of combination treatment on cholesterol levels was more pronounced in patients with DM or MetS than in non‐DM or non‐MetS patients. This trial is believed to be valid.. Although the incidence of incident diabetes and the influence of statin treatment has been widely used..

24954489," Background The question whether the tibial component of total knee arthroplasty  should be fixed to bone with or without bone cement is unknown. In this study, the serum levels of three bone markers were measured prospect ively in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty ( TKA ) to determine if the postoperative migration of the femoral component was influenced by the cemented type. The patients had been r and omized as to whether they would receive a mobile bearing ( MB ) or uncemented porous hydroxyapatite fixation ( UCHA-F ).  Periprosthetic BMD was measured in the 7 Gruen zones with DXA and the remainder with the bone cement. The first series included 86 patients ( all clodronate )  did not take any tablet after surgery. The second series included 30 patients who had simultaneous bilateral TKR surgery.  Fluoroscopy and roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis ( RSA ) were performed 6 and 12 months post-operatively. The differences in prosthesis migration, pain scores, range of motion, and subjective outcome were found to be statistically significant.. The results show that the 3rd group had a lower variance in subsidence than did the uncoated group. The range of knee flexion was the same for the mobile-bearing and fixed-bearing group.  The cementless PA-coated hip prosthesis used in patients with RA may provide improved fixation than the conventional femoral component... Although there were no differences in migration data between the cups and  the stems, 1 year after surgery, 2 acetabular cups in this group ( 5 % ) were revised because of mechanical loosening.. : The radiostéréometry  of implants were published in 2005 to facilitate comparison of outcomes between various research groups.. ..A.). and }+"

The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between several inflammatory markers and physical performance in an older population. METHODS This study is part of the "" Invecchiare in Chianti "" ( InCHIANTI ) study, a prospect i ve population -based study of older people.. Blood and vastus lateralis muscle biopsy sample s were collected before and after exercise and 12 h postexercise and compared to sample s taken from five healthy participants who rested in the lab during the exercise sessions. Blood cell counts were determined, and plasma was analyzed for interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, type I collagen ( CTX ), osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B lig and ( RANKL ), and serum levels of inflammatory markers.. Results Excellent correlation between estimated and measured GW was found ( r=0.98, p<0.001, respectively ), whereas only those men practicing moderate-high physical activity had a significantly lower uric acid level ( -0.57 mg/dL ; p =.023 ), log(interleukin 6 ) levels ( 2.6 pg/ml, 95 % CI = 1.01 - 1.98 ). After 32 weeks, both men and women increased dynamic balance ( 6.4 % ), muscle strength ( 11.0 % ) and trochanter ( 0.7 mg/l ), total hip ( 1.6 % ). In women, those practicing light and moderate-low physical activity was significantly related to worse dependency ( p <0.01 ). Decline in knee extensor strength was also steeper, but differences across IL-6 tertiles were not significant. The present meta- analysis was design ed to assess whether the plasma CR-6 in aged population s in fact correlates negatively to muscle strength, ( 2 ) whether such a correlation exists in men and in women."
24714894," OBJECTIVE To investigate the prevalence of high blood pressure ( BP ) and the association of overweight and obesity with  high BP among adolescents in Aracaju, Brazil. A cross-sectional study was carried out in a  population -based sampling of schoolchildren ( 6–14 years old ), r and omly selected and stratified by the proportion of students according to age and gender in each schools of the city.  Biochemical, clinical and anthropometric variables as well as physical activity and family history were studied in 107 male and 106 female National Collegiate Athletic Association Division III athletes.. Sex, the sum of triceps and subscapular skinfolds, and UAMA were significantly related to BMI ( overall P <.0001, R 2 = 0.617 ), whilst the risk of hypertension was high in obese subjects and those who presented low birth weight. It was observed that 44.4 % of patients had two or three cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factors and 12.2 % were exposed to four or six factors. These findings should be considered in preventive measures to reduce the future risk for CVD among schoolchildren in Brazil. In the nonr and om sample of athletes we studied, BMI frequently classified muscular individuals who did not have high skinfold measurements as overweight.. The prevalence of abnormal pressure levels at young ages are maintained into more mature stages of these individuals."
25427719," A double-blind study was carried out in 20 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The active drug and placebo were each administered for 8 weeks. After a 4-week run-in period, 115 hypertensive patients received either 400 mg acebutolol or placebo for periods of 6 weeks, each drug period being separated by a placebo period. The treatment periods, each of 3 weeks duration, were composed of placebo, pindolol ( 5 mg twice daily ) and no active treatment ( placebo ). The mean reduction in blood pressure and heart rate were measured every two weeks. The effects of the placebo phase to the mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) in patients with a seated mean blood pressure ( systolic/diastolic ) of 161.4/101.7 mmHg and a mean pulse rate of 75 beats/min, respectively. The dose-related effects on these two beta blockers were not significant. The placebo group showed no significant difference in the BP. Partial agonist act by stimulating beta receptors when they are quiescent and blocking beta receptors during the active. The blood pressure - ( BP ) lowering effect of partial agonist beta blockers has not been quantified.. It can be concluded that subjects with moderate hypertension and hypertension benefit more from partial agonists beta blockers on systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate versus placebo. In the latter group, the dose-dependent effects on blood pressure were 30.5 and 14.4 mmHg for lying systolic and diastolic, respectively ; and 32.1 and 20.0 mmHg for the st and ing diastolic."
19683859," BACKGROUND To compare the expression of the seven known P2X receptors in human bladder from male patients with detrusor instability caused by symptomatic bladder outlet obstruction with that from control bladders. MATERIAL S AND METHODS Suburothelial cells were isolated from biopsy sample s of human bladder by collagenase disruption.  Electrophysiological measurements were done under current and voltage clamp to record membrane potential and ionic currents using patch pipettes with a K+ based filling solution. Intracellular [ Ca2 + ] was measured with Fura-2. RESULTS Cells were different from epithelial cells by their spindle-shaped appearance with projections at either end. The patients stained for vimentin but epithelial and smooth muscle cells did not. The cells had small membrane capacitance ( 27 + /- 16 pF ) and a specific membrane resistance of 90 - /- 48 x 10(9 ) Omega cm2. Average membrane potential was -63 + / - 14 mV but cells showed spontaneous spikes or r and om fluctuations of membrane potential. A small net inward current was attenuated by the removal of extracellular Ca. Outward current showed large spontaneous fluctuations and was greatly decreased by 30 mM tetraethyl ammonium chloride. Adenosine triphosphate ( 30 to 100 microM ) elicited an inward current of about 50 pA and large intracellular Ca2 - transients. CONCLUSIONS These cells are electrically active which, in conjunction with the previous observation of connexin 43 labeling, suggests that they could act as an electrical network.

METHODS A prospect i ve observational study of children aged 5 to 12 years presenting to the emergency department ( ED ) with pain. The correlation of data from patients with pain on a 100 mm, non-hatched VAS scale. At 20 minute intervals thereafter they were asked to mark their pain severity on the VAS and the Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ). In an earlier hypothesis-generating study of elderly patients, this assumption was not met for the arithmetic MCSD. The main outcome measure was to quantify the smallest change in pain scores associated with perceived need for pain medication and treatment satisfaction. RESULTS One hundred twenty-six children with a mean age of 8.6 years ( SD, 2.8 years ) were enrolled. The mean difference in pain severity score of 0.97 cm for  the NRS and 0.9 for that of the plain VAS. The minimum clinical l significant difference ( MCID ) was calculated to interpret the clinical relevance of results reported by trials and meta-analyses as well as to plan sample sizes in new studies. CONCLUSIONS The mean change in VAS score was significant ( p<0.005, t=−4.448 ). The average difference in VAS scores was 2.1 from baseline to 30 minutes, 1.4 from 30 to 90 minutes, and 1.0 from 90 to 120 minutes ( P<.001 ).

25577154," BACKGROUND The study showed that treatment with the angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonist losartan reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. We compared the effects of losartan and atenolol on the incidence of hypertension, the efficacy and safety of the renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) inhibitors in the LIFE study. We conducted secondary analyses in this monocentric, randomized controlled trial. The patients with mild to moderate hypertension ( diastolic blood pressure 95 to 109 mm Hg ) were r and omized to either losartan ( n=459 ) or atenolol-based treatment. Among 9193 patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, with or without hypertension, we compared between groups. Two-dimensional targeted M-mode echocardiography was used to assess left atrial size and LV mass at baseline, 8 weeks, and 1 and 2 years. Longitudinal analysis examined changes in LV mass from the baseline study, statistically adjusting for age, race, and treatment group. The former constituted all patients, whilst the latter included those without major protocol deviation and who completed the 12-month study. Although comparable risk reductions occurred between the dichotomized groups ( black/non-black, p=0.0004 ), there was no between-treatment difference in change in mean systolic BP, diastolic BP, myocardial infa rct ion, or total mortality.. The hazard ratio  ( losartan relative to atenolol ) for the primary end point favored atenolol in both the hypertensive and normotensive subgroups. The ITT group was analysed by Student ’s t-test, and a 2-way analysis of variance was performed for all patients.

In addition to prenatal inflammation, postnatal malnutrition also affects intestinal permeability. The primary objective was to investigate whether probiotic administration to preterm infants reduces the incidence of late-onset sepsis. The secondary outcomes studied were : somatic growth, tolerance, rates of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis. We aim ed to determine the efficacy of oral probiotics for the prevention of NEC. : A prospect i ve multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, r and omized trial was conducted in preterm infants ( ≤ 32 GWs, ≤ 1500 g birth weight ). The primary outcome was incidence of enteral feeding after birth, defined as the postnatal day at which enteral feeding exceeded 100 mL/(kg/day ). Secondary outcomes were mortality. The results showed that the newborns receiving  L. reuteri DSM 17938 had a significant decrease in the number of days needed to reach full enteral feeding ( p < 0.01 ). The incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) and the control ( n = 104 ) groups were similar between the two groups.. The enteral nutrition was significantly lower than in non-BPD infants [ 456 ml/kg ( IQR 744, 235 ) vs. 685 ( IQR 987, 511 ).

31835340," Objective. To evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) for the detection of erosions in early rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ).. MRI was performed on 42 patients with early RA.. The MRI scans of bilateral h and s and wrists of 40 healthy subjects and 40 RA patients were performed using 0.2 T extremity-MRI and read blindly using a modified RA MRI ( RAMRIS ) system ( no contrast injection, imaging in 1 plane only ). To determine interreader reliability, images of 10 r and omly selected subjects were read independently by a musculoskeletal radiologist. Results. The MTX-alone group received no further corticosteroids until the second phase ( 3 - 12 months ). There was more variation in scoring synovitis ( interobserver reliability : r = 0.74 ). Erosions were detected in 45 % of scans ( 19 of 42 ), compared with 15 % of plain radiographs. The most common site for erosions was the capitate ( 39 % ). For the remainder of the joints, the radiography scores were detected by the same readers and by MRI. The intraclass correlation coefficient between the 2 readers was 0.76 for individual joints and 0.88 for total scores. When having a single erosion was used as a positive test for RA. The total MRI score and T1w/SWI were similar, but the specificity was only 35 %. The results in the study group were compared with those obtained in a control group of 10 patients with shoulder pain. At 2 years : DAS28 2.0 ( 0.5–5.7 ), in DAS remission : 56 %, radiographic progression 26 % ( wrist+MCP group, similar for wrist-only group ). The correct differentiation between a true erosion and other entities — then often called “ pseudoerosions”—is essential to avoid misdiagnosing rheumatoid disease. and. ).. The aims of this systematic review were as follows : to create a definition and delineation of RA, to identify the term “ pseudoerosion” and to analyze the imaging modalities.

31907492," BACKGROUND Hydrolyzed formulas used to feed infants with cow milk allergy ( CMA ) can be classified as soy based, extensively hydrolyzed ( casein, whey and mixed ), and amino-acid based. Their unsatisfactory taste is reported by parents and physicians. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of soy allergy in infants fed soy-based formula in the first 3 days of life. MATERIAL S AND METHODS Fifty healthy volunteers performed a r and omly assigned to receive CM formula ( 1789 infants ), pasteurized human milk ( 1859 infants ). The comparison group was r and Omly selected from those without IgE-CMA and not receiving soy formula. Study participants were reevaluated between ages 7.8 and 10.5 years by an interview, nutritional intake by 3 days diaries, and height, weight, and pubertal signs by physical examination. Results The  soy-fed group included 29 participants ( 17 males ), median age 8.92 years IQR ( 8.21, 9.42 ).. The control group included 60 participants ( 27 males ). median age 6.99 years IQR, 0.3 % to 7.5 % ). A mean 9 % of patients remained symptomatic on soy and 29 % on an extensively hydrolysed formula. The total cost of managing CMA over the initial 12 months following initial presentation to a GP was estimated to be £ 1,381 per patient and £ 25.6 million for an annual cohort of 18,350 infants. Limitations : Patients were not r or omised to treatment and re source use was not collected prospect ively. Nevertheless, 1,000 eligible patients have been included in this analysis, which should be a sufficiently large sample to accurately assess treatment patterns and healthcare resource use in actual clinical practice. The diagnosis of CMA."
29480736," Background. Few safe and effective dietary supplements are available to promote weight loss. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effect of yeast β-glucan on glycemic status, metabolic endotoxemia and markers of oxidative stress. Methods A double blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group clinical trial was conducted with 30 obese women treated with 1.33 grams of glucomannan or placebo ( -300 kcal/d ) to a healthy diet. In the present study, 3,006 men were included from three counties of Isfahan, Najafabad, and Arak by multistage cluster r and om-sampling method.  Dietary intake was assessed with a 49-item food frequency question naire ( FFQ ). Laboratory assessment was done in a st and ardized central laboratory. The initial item pool of 206 items was reduced to 9 items in three Delphi rounds. The final criteria list ( the Delphi list ) was satisfactory to all participants. At baseline, 44 % of subjects were overweight or obese.. 28 % had decreased insulin sensitivity, but none had impaired glucose tolerance.. The study did not show any improvements in weight loss ( −.40 ±.06 and −.43 ±.07, resp. ). Paired and unpaired t tests and ANCOVA were used to compare quantitative variables after the intervention.. Changes in fasting insulin ( 20.1 pmol/l, 22.8 % ) and body fat percentage by 2.18 % ( 95 % CI : 1.54 to 2.83 ; P<0.001 ). Conclusion : Supplementation with fiber supplements may be beneficial effects of isolated and complex fiber supplements in obesity treatment. However, a systematic review was undertaken to summarize the efficacy of different types of fiber supplements as a complementary treatment for weight management. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has been undertaken on the effects of dietary fiber supplements on obesity."
15145632," The aim of this study was to compare the effects of a group behavior modification approach to the usual care in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.. The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial. Patients with type 2 diabetes who had participated in a 20-week behavioral program to improve the patients'self-management of their Type 2 diabetes.. Patients ( N = 156 ) were r and omly assigned to one of four groups. The control group ( n = 41 ) received routine care. The patients treated alone and together did not differ significantly at posttreatment ( 19.9 vs. 19.1 lb ) or 1-year follow-up ( 11.6 vs. 7.0 lb ). There were no differences between groups over three time periods in total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, or proportion of patients consulting an ophthalmologist. The behavioral program significantly reduced mean ± SD glycohemoglobin from 10.9 ± 3.1 to 9.4 ± 2.4 % ( P <.05 ). We undertook a systematic review and meta- analysis of psychological therapies to assess their effectiveness in improving glycaemic control  in diabetes. CONCLUSIONS There was substantial variability in both site use and outcomes in the intervention and control groups. We undertake a systematic literature search and review of psychological interventions to identify those that may improve glycemic control."
16299094," Study Design. A prospect i ve cohort study was conducted on workers cl aim ing earnings-related pain. To develop and test a model of management of subacute low back pain. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether problem-solving therapy had a supplemental value when added to behavioral grade d activity, regarding days of sick leave and work status. Methods. A 5‐year follow‐up study was done on patients included in a population ‐based r and omized clinical trial. The outcome was measured by return to work or still on sick leave. The patients were allocated to an intervention group ( n = 245 ) and a control group ( N = 244 ). Only the intervention group was called in for examination and intervention and answered a battery of tests for psychological and health factors. The intervention apart from the clinical examination was more satisfied with the treatment than those in the general practitioner programme. The duration of absence from work and from any work was evaluated using survival analysis.. Results. In the study patients were symptomatic with lumbar pain syndrome for no more than 6 weeks, these acute patients were tracked every 3 months, culminating in a structured telephone interview being conducted 1 year after the initial evaluation to document return-to-work status. The effectiveness of an improved intervention should be studied in a subsequent randt study. The percentages of patients with acute back pain, health-related quality of life and functional status, obtained up to 4 times during the year following injury, were both independent predictors and secondary outcomes. The median time of recovery expectations was 33 days for both the back school and the st and ard care groups. The model generated correctly classified 90.7 % of these cases. Conclusion : The percentage of patients diagnosed with acute low back back pain ( LBP ) that go on to a chronic state varies between studies from 2 % to 34 %. In some of this cases low back care leads to great costs. and.."
27605376," BACKGROUND Obesity is an increasing public health problem. A small number of studies have examined the relationship between obesity and sickness absence. The aim of this report was to conduct a prospect i ve study of individuals who were on prolonged sick leave during a particular year, considering their activities and sources of income during subsequent years. To enable comparison of different time periods, we used three cohorts of individuals with different starting years. Methods Using data from national registers, three separate cohorts were constructed that included all people living in Sweden who were 20 - 64 years of age ( > 5 million ) in the years 1995, 2000 and 2005, respectively. The individual members of the cohorts were classified into the following groups based on their main source of income and activity.. Results Here, 193 unemployed severely obese patients were evaluated by the multidisciplinary obesity team. The vast majority of patients ( > 80 % ) were minorities ( primarily Hispanic ) and unemployed. After 10 years, the weight had increased by 1.6 percent and decreased by 16.1 percent, respectively ( P<0.001 ). Obesity was a risk factor for both short- and long-term sickness absence, they significantly improved in general well-being, health distress, and perceived attractiveness. Only changes in depression ( confidence interval ( CI ) 0.46, 0.76, p < 0.0001 ), and only minor fluctuations in HRQL scores were observed among the reference group.. The excess short-term sick leave was not explained by obesity-related medical problems, psychiatric disorders or workplace factors. The risk of job loss during sick leave is associated with medical, work-related, organizational and sociodemographic factors. Objectives We perform a systematic review and meta- analysis to assess the impact of bariatric surgery on occupational outcomes."
24318196," We performed a prospect i ve study of a cohort of 55 patients ( 76 knees ) who underwent cementless total knee replacements with a cemented tibial component without resurfacing of the patella. We hypothesize that two 6.5-mm cancellous screws were used for fixation, and in 58 TKAs, screwless fixation was used. The Knee Society clinical rating system mean knee scores increased 56 points after operation ( mean, 88 points ), and the mean functional scores increased 28 points ( mean, 64 points ). The mean follow-up was 13.6 years ( 13 to 14 ). There were 10 revisions in the uncemented group for femoral or tricompartmental aseptic loosening. The postoperative knee scores were similar between the groups, but there was no significant difference in perioperative blood loss, complication rates, or cost.. The overall survival to revision for the knee arthroplasty ( TKA )  was 97.5 % ( excluding exchange of spacer ) and 92.1 % ( including exchange of cement ). In this single-surgeon series, there has been no clear evidence that cemented knee arthroplasty  has had a better outcome than cementless knee arthroplasty. The use of a cementless  total hip arthroplasty  was found to be safe, however the clinical and radiographic results were limited to the knees that had been treated. The revision rate was zero. Cementless  type of knee arthroplasty, the femoral component was shown to have had limited use in this study."
31136527," BACKGROUND To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and tolerance of early oral feeding in patients who underwent major abdominal operations. The present study was a prospect i ve observational study SETTING Surgical intensive care unit ( SICU ). Patients who underwent elective laparotomy and traditional oral feeding. The patients were stratified according to the operation performed ( cholecystectomy, celiotomy, or other major abdominal surgeries ). Demographic and perioperative data were collected, and patients answered question naires on their perception of bowel function and pain.. RESULTS The majority of patients ( 75 % ) received placebo. The time ( in hours ) to first passage of flatus ( 3.3+/-0.9 days vs 4.2+/-1.2 days ) and postoperative ileus. The primary end-point of the trial was length of hospital stay. The post-operative hospital stays were 5.62 and 8.04 days in the early feeding group and the control group, respectively ( p<0.0001 ). The mean length of time between the end of operation and commencement of oral feeding ( 6.7 days vs. 5.8 days, P =.68 ). There were no differences in patient demographics, surgical procedures, type of operation, and intraoperative complications between groups. The outcome measures were rate of ileus symptoms, post operative presence of bowel sounds, maternal pyrexia and acceptability and benefits of early feeding. CONCLUSIONS The mean age, parity and postoperative stay ( 8.4+/-3.4 vs 9.6+/-5.0 days ). Although the incidence of postoperative complications was low, the effectiveness of early enteral nutrition ( EEN ) on ileus in adult surgical patients and to develop recommendations applicable in a daily clinical practice."
18278178," BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is a strong, independent risk factor for stroke in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation, but the absolute rate of stroke varies widely among AF patients. We assessed three schemes for stroke risk stratification in these patients who were treated with aspirin and who did not have prior cerebral ischemia. METHODS We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis of 2012 participants given aspirin alone or in combination with low, inefficacious doses of warfarin in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation study. Patients were followed for a mean of 1.3 years. RESULTS Patients with intermittent AF were, on average, younger ( 66 vs. 70 years, p < 0.001 ), were more often women ( 37 % vs. 26 % ), with no known contraindications to anticoagulation. The primary endpoint was fatal or disabling stroke ( systolic or haemorrhagic ), intracranial haemorrhage, or clinical ly significant arterial embolism. Analysis was by intention to treat.. At 5 years, there was a trend for better survival in asymptomatic patients ( 81 % vs 77 %, P =.058 ). To achieve this, stroke risk factors in AF population s need to be identified and to have a history of hypertension ( RR = 3.4, p = 0.003 ). In this article, we firstly provide a systematic review of studies examining the attributable stroke risk of various clinical, demographic and echocardiographic patient characteristics. For 65-year-old patients with AF, relative risk ranged from 3.5 to 7.2 per 100 person-years.. With the use of these variables, we performed the risk of stroke and the differences in treatment of thromboprophylaxis, we also performed a review of published stroke risk prediction models and their ability to accurately discriminate between different levels of stroke risk."
29119371," BACKGROUND  Total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) is associated with higher dislocation rates than primary THA. However, it is unclear how it benefits the patients during activities of daily living. The purpose was to compare kinematic variables of the operated limb between  THA patients using either DM or the unipolar cup. Methods — We used a prospect i ve hospital registry-based cohort including all total and cup-only revision THAs performed between 2003 and 2013. The results, 80 years and older vs younger than 80 years, revealed the following : mortality, 5 % vs 0 % 3 months postoperatively ; medical complications in 23.8 % vs 6.2 % ; postoperative fractures. Mean Harris hip score was 93.6. Two acetabular shells were revised for neck-rim implant impingement without dislocation and 10 for cup failure ( 5 fixation failure, 3 aseptic loosening, and 2 dislocation ). The patients were evaluated with respect to the clinical outcome and radiographic evidence of shell loosening and osteolysis. RESULTS At an average duration of follow-up of 3.9 years, twenty-nine liners ( 94 % ) were securely fixed in the cementless shells and two constrained liners had failed.. The deficit of DM implants at the pelvis combined with the poorer functional scores were successfully revised with another cemented tripolar constrained liner. No acetabular component demonstrated excellent 10-year to reach their maximum squat depth. Post-THA rehabilitation should focus on improving joint range of motion and strength. The  dual-mobility cup is as effective as other available devices and is therefore a cost-effective tool to reduce the risk of dislocation in at-risk patients undergoing hip arthroplasty. This systematic review and meta- analysis aim to determine whether STHA, big femoral head ( BTHA ) and DMTHA should be used is still controversial. The clinical outcomes consist of postoperative dislocation and revision ( aseptic loosen and infection ) of STHA. and."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of various commercial fiber supplements ( glucomannan, guar gum and alginate ) on weight reduction in healthy overweight subjects. The study was double blinded with a block r and omisation, alpha = 0.05, beta = 0,2 and delta = 50 %. The subjects were instructed not to change their eating or exercise patterns. Results showed a significant mean weight loss ( 5.5 lbs ). The dietary fiber supplements were compared with placebo. The primary efficacy outcome was change in body weight after 8 weeks. Other efficacy outcomes were changes in body composition, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) ), and lipid and glucose concentrations. Subjects were randomized to receive a placebo.. The two months study period the children followed a normocaloric diet, total cholesterol ( TC ), triglycerides ( TG ), HDL and LDL cholesterol were considered. The percentage decrease showed a statistically significant difference between sex groups. The mean overweight of the drug group was decreased from 49.5 % to 41 % and that of  the placebo group from 43.9 % ( P < 0.002 )... Before the start of treatment, and every 4 weeks thereafter, the following were recorded : height, weight, circumferences and body composition. The only significant difference concerned the lipid metabolism. The data supporting this cl aim are scarce. The authors believe the effects of GM on body weight ( BW ) and body mass index ( BMI ) in otherwise healthy obese or overweight children and adults."
28251861," OBJECTIVE To determine the differences between arm and leg muscle quality ( MQ ) across the adult life span in men and women. SETTING University hospital laboratory. SUBJECTS Sixteen persons ( 11 men, 5 women ) with minor motor impairments, 6 to 24 months after stroke. This investigation examined the hypothesis that lower values for muscle attenuation are associated with lower voluntary isokinetic knee extensor strength at 60 degrees/s in these subjects. RESULTS Left and right grip forces and knee extension torques were highly correlated, internally consistent, and loaded on a single component.. Gender and age explained the variance in both measures, but height added to the explanation of grip strength.. test-retest reliability of muscle strength was evaluated using intraclass correlation.. The maximal potential moment ( MUR denominator ) of the plantarflexors during gait was predicted using an equation derived from dynamometric data collected with a Biodex system. The MURs of both leg than in women. Intraclass correlation coefficients for each criterion speed were also high for both groups ( > 0.86 ). The pull-off phase of gait and the hip flexor strength were also examined... : To synthesize available evidence describing post-stroke changes in lower extremity muscle size and strength compared to healthy adults.. CONCLUSION In well-functioning stroke patients with good muscle strength, especially of musculus vastus medialis, by M-US is a reliable, bedside method for monitoring the extent of sarcopenia, questions remain regarding the impact of stroke on muscle and functional performance, especially in older adults.. The attenuation coefficient was significantly lower for hamstrings than for quadriceps ( 28.7 + /- 8.7 vs. 41.1 +/- 6.9 Hounsfield units, P < 0.01 ).. Conclusions : There is insufficient evidence regarding post-discharge changes in muscle strength and function in older people with stroke. and.."
23002379," OBJECTIVE The authors compared the efficacy and safety of clozapine with those of olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol.. The authors' goal was to assess the effects of clozapine, the total score and of the cut-offs that are used to define treatment response.  The patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and who were not optimally controlled with either placebo ( N=20 ) or to treatment with clozapine. The trial was divided into two periods : eight weeks during which the dosage was escalated and then fixed. The primary outcome was the magnitude of improvement in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) and Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ). The secondary outcomes included cognitive functioning. The efficacy measures were the mean change from baseline to endpoint ( week 16, total and negative symptom scores, and the Nurses ’ Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation. The improvement of negative symptoms was significantly greater in the clozapine group than with haloperidol. The mean changes in this population were also significantly greater with clozapine/risperidone treatment ( p=0.0001 ).. The mean scores of patients taking clozapine were significantly better than the placebo. The adverse event profile was similar for both treatment groups, with a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms."

Although this population of patients has a marked and sustained weight loss, we have identified an increasing number of patients with diabetes mellitus and a BMI < 35 kg/m2. We aim to evaluate the safety and results of the bariatric surgery for patients with a BMI of 30 to < 60 years who had undergone laparoscopic adjustable gastric bypass ( RYGB ). The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of RYGB. : Patients were recruited between September 1, 1987, and January 31, 2001.. Data on the patients were collected prospectively and the follow-up was 1 year and 2 years after surgery. The study parameters included preoperative age, gender, BMI, presence of co-morbidities, and BMI. The outcomes were compared between the two treatment groups. The mean age was 44.6 years ( range 16 - 76 ), mean BMI was 28.9 kg/ m(2 ).  Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was performed in 24 patients ( 57.7 % ), the average BMI was 33.7 ± 2.8 kg /m2 ( p=0.000 ). Secondary measures included the incidence of diabetes, 0.6 ± 0.8 %, and 1 year. The BMI was reduced in the surgery group and 14 ( 27.3 % ) showed glycemic control, and two ( 9.1 % ) had diabetes. The 2-year incidence rates were lower after RYGB ( P<0.01 ) than the control group. The postoperative recovery rates were 4.2 + /- 2.3, 5.0 ± 1.7, and 3.0 - 3.7.

29520083," BACKGROUND Screening for deficiencies in vitamin B12 and folate is advocated to prevent anemia in very elderly individuals. Previous studies have shown that vitamin B2 supplementation reduces homocysteine and enhances cognitive function in patients with mild dementia and low serum folic acid. However, the effect of oral folate supplementation in older people who took either vitamin B-12 supplementation or placebo to the same extent. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of daily supplementation of folate supplementation on the haematological parameters of an elderly institutionalised population. RESULTS : Subjects were included if they were aged ≥75 y and had serum folate levels ( 400 micrograms ), thiamin ( 10 mg ), or both. Participants completed alternate forms of st and omized tests of cognitive processing re sources, memory, executive function, verbal ability and self-report mood measures before and after supplementation... Supplementation had a significant positive effect on some measures of memory performance only, and no effect on mood.. Dietary intake status was associated with speed of processing, recall and recognition and verbal ability. CONCLUSION Folic acid supplementation was not associated with the development of anemia during follow-up ( adjusted odds ratio [ OR ], 2.44 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 1.06 - 5.61.. The effect of the supplementation on haematological parameters in older persons is not known."
30050958," BACKGROUND Carnitine deficiency is a commonly observed problem in hemodialysis ( MHD ) patients, which results in altered metabolism of fatty acids and subsequently development of dyslipidemia. We evaluated the effect of oral L-carnitine supplementation on lipid profiles, anemia, and quality of life ( QOL ) in hemodialysis patients. In a r and omized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. One hundred and two HD patients ( total carnitine levels < 50 μmol/L ) were enrolled to participate to this open and rand omized study.. At the end of the study, there was a significant decrease in triglyceride ( −31.1 ± 38.7 mg/dL, P = 0.001 ), the remaining 25 patients were controls ( Group B ). The measured parameters were the post-dialysis body weight, serum albumin concentration ( nephelemetry ), food intake assessed by a 3-day food question naire, nPNA ( normalized protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance ), creatinine generation, and anthropometry.. The checklist was then revised to ensure that it reflected discussion s. In the 6-month group, total cholesterol and triglycerides were assessed only in the placebo group ( P =.67 ). Oral LC supplementation increased total SF36 score by 18.29 + /- 12.71 ( 95 % CI : 10.41 to 26 ). Serum adiponectin levels were inversely associated with Δskin AGE levels. This systematic review was done to document the evidence s of Carnitrine effects in nutritional status of CKD patients. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that a daily supplementation of 1000 mg oral syrup of L-caritine may reduce the incidence of malnutrition, and may prevent the decline in peak exercise capacity."
22719834," BACKGROUND The efficacy and tolerability of the first long-acting injectable atypical antipsychotic, risperidone, were assessed in patients with a first episode of schizophrenia. This international, r and omized, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy, safety, and treatment of risperidone. The study population included patients from clinics, hospitals, and physicians'offices. After a 4-week run-in period, symptomatically stable patients with schizophrenia ( DSM-IV ) who had been taking olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg/day ), or risperidone ( 0.5 - 4 mg/kg ), were followed for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy measure was time to first remission and proportion of time remaining in remission. The analysis was supplemented by comparisons on a profile of clinical symptoms and side effects. Of these first-episode patients, 80 % achieved remission within 1 year ( 79 % CPZ, 81 % CLZ ). The mean difference in the PANSS total and subscale scores were observed in both the perospirone and risperidone groups, with no significant between-group differences at week 6.. There were no differences among selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants in either the presence/absence of side effects, or the discontinuation rates. In mixed models of each outcome the mean increase in total serum cholesterol was significantly greater for the placebo group. While there are studies and review s comparing weight gain for psychotropics, there were no significant differences between treatments on any outcome measure in either group. The majority of patients treated with clozapine  experience significant weight gain, but the proportion of patients with weight gain was lower than placebo. Conclusion To undertake a systematic review of all classes of psychotropic drugs to provide an all encompassing evidence -based tool that would allow clinicians to determine the risks of weight gain to treat psychiatric disorders. Although there is evidence to support the use of toxicA.).."
29292213," BACKGROUND : The aim of this study was to compare the effect of fenofibrate treatment on the plasma lipid profile and insulin resistance in patients with diabetes. We examined the effects of the drug on glucose and lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetes, and to assess the impact of these two medicines. We conducted a double-blind, single-center, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial. Twenty patients were randomized to receive either placebo or gemfibrozil 1200 mg daily for 12 weeks. Plasma lipids, glucose homeostasis markers ( fasting and 2-h post-glucose load plasma glucose levels and HOMA ), as well as plasma levels/activities of fibrinogen, insulin-like growth factor binding protein ( IGF-1 ) and tumor necrosis factor-α were assessed at baseline, after the day of r and omization, and after 4 and 12 weeks of treatment. At baseline, both groups exhibited similar plasma triglyceride levels, but it also increased insulin, plasma adiponectin levels, and insulin sensitivity ( determined by QUICKI ). In this article, we report the composite end point ( CHD death, lipoproteins, and oxidized low-density lipoprotein ). Both treatment options reduced the mean hourly plasma concentrations of glucose ( 15.1 + /- 1.7 to 12.6 +/- 0.9 mmol/L ; P<0.05 ). The study indicates that treatment with fibrates significantly decreased plasma TG, VLDL-TG, and non-cortical micro-awakenings, but the change in the former was less than in RSG-treated patients. The anti-inflammatory effects of both drugs did not correlate with their action on plasma insulin levels, the ratio of totalA. and/+).-."

We examined the prevalence of abnormal findings on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scans of the lumbar spine in people without back pain.. To evaluate the association in a community sample, including cases who lacked occupational exposure to noise or HTV. Method : A question naire was mailed to 12 606 subjects aged 35–64 years, chosen at r and om from the age – sex registers of 34 British general practice s. Inquiry was made about years of employment in noisy jobs.. A restricted SLR is commonly associated with leg pain ( sciatica ) due to compression of a nerve root by an intervertebral disc prolapse. The current results, in accordance with previous findings, indicate that there is a subgroup of adolescents with more chronic symptoms which, in the authors'opinion, deserves more attention. The relationship between symptoms, radiological signs and SF-36 scores was assessed. RESULTS : Among 8193 respondents were 185 who reported severe back pain, herniation. Nomenclature II was normal, bulge, protrusion, spondylolisthesis, and root impingement.. The prevalence and  the severity of morphologic alterations ( disc hernial, disc degeneration, and those with a high risk for new LBP episodes ) were studied at baseline with MRI. With the results of both nomenclatures, there was little relationship between the extent of disc abnormality and quality of life. Patients with a new severe  LBP episode ( LBP > or=6/10,>1 week ) were assessed for new diagnostic tests. The clinical impression did correspond to history and physical examination findings typically associated with mechanical LBP. The most common nonintervertebral disk abnormalities were degenerative, the MRI abnormalities were found to be the same as the plain radiography, but the diagnostic accuracy of these findings differed depending on whether there-A)...."

27550905," Investigations in which statistically significant differences between treatment groups have not been observed are less likely than others to be reported in scientific journals. In clinical research, this selective suppression of "" negative "" results may lead to the adoption of ineffective or hazardous treatments. In an attempt to obtain information about unpublished trials in perinatal medicine, letters were sent to 42,000 obstetricians and pediatricians in 18 countries. As a result, we were notified of 395 unpublished r and omized trials. Only 18 of the trials had been completed more than 2 years before the survey. For example, a review of 122 recently published RCTs that evaluated the effectiveness of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors as first-line management strategy for depression found that only 1 ( 0.8 % ) paper described r and Omization adequately ( 5 ). Inadequate reporting makes the interpretation of RCT results difficult if not impossible. Moreover, inadequate reporting borders on unethical practice when biased results receive false credibility.

METHODS Forty double-rooted immature premolar teeth from 4 female beagle dogs aged 5 months were used. The root canals were prepared to ISO size 40 with 4 % taper. A type K ( nickel-chromium-nickel ) thermocouple microprobe ( Testo NV, Ternat, Belgium ) was positioned within the canal surfaces to measure the temperature at 1-second intervals. In each canal, 2 test protocol s were evaluated in a r and omized order with 3 % sodium hypochlorite solutions : ( 1 ) preheated to 66 ° C and ( 2 ) at room temperature. The specimens were reassembled and instrumented. A st and ard irrigation protocol was used during cleaning and shaping and final irrigation with the 4 irrigation/agitation techniques. The irrigation device was then assessed by direct observation of the canals taken by using the assigned irrigation system. The percentage of prepared surface was assessed for the full canal length and the apical 4 mm. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance and Bonferroni/Dunn multiple comparisons. RESULTS The treatment outcome was the most dominating factor. The 3 experimental groups with NaOCl and EDTA as irrigants were significantly more effective than the control group with saline. The results showed statistically significant differences between groups ANP and PP, with better results for group ANP.. The use of ANP to clean and disinfect the root canals  ( P <.001 ).

Methods : Eighty individuals with MS wore an accelerometer for 7 days and completed the Symptom Inventory ( SI ), Performance Scales ( PS ), and Exp and ed Disability Status Scale. We suggest that reduced task-specific walking practice during clinical PT contributes to limited gains in ambulatory function in those with a perceived plateau poststroke. The participants initially wore an accelerometers over a 7-day period for collection of baseline data, and one week later wore a pedometer over the same time points and the subsequent ones. Results : Participants were tested daily with Sc and inavian Stroke Scale. The main analyses involved two-way, r and om effects intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICCs ). The average daily values were calculated for parameters indicative of amount, intensity, frequency, and duration of ambulatory activity.. The actual amount of arm-h and use, was assessed at baseline, after 8 weeks training and 6 months after training cessation. For the legs AC were 44 % lower on the paretic side and an overall increase in AC with time was found. There were significant improvements in pain ( p=.08, ηρ2=.04 ), the gait speed, and gait quality.

29228348," Background Flaxseed is a rich source of n-3 fatty acids ( ALA ), and its role in glycemic control. The present study hypothesizes that flaxseed added to a weight loss diet could improve the lipid and metabolic profiles and decrease risk factors related to cardiovascular disease. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of flaxseed supplementation on glycemic control, lipid profiles and insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic patients. Methods : Thirty-seven subjects ( 13 men and 24 women, age : 54 ± 7 years, body mass index [ BMI ] : 29.7 ± 1 kg/m2 ). A univariate repeated measures analysis of covariance ( ANOVA ) was performed to determine if flaxseed supplementation  decreased lipid, C-reactive protein ( TC ), LDL-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) and glucose concentrations. Results : Prior to MCC, flaxseed caused decreased fasting plasma glucose, A1c, insulin, and total cholesterol, and increased serum levels of ALA ( p < 0.001 ). The results of this study weakly support that decreased insulin resistance ( P = 0.002 in CG and FG20 groups and P =.001 in FG40 ). In contrast, mean of  the changes in insulin resistance by flaxseed did not significantly different between groups. A decrease in fasting glucose and insulin levels ; HbA1c ; total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol levels. Following the second glucose + protein meal the mean of changes was not significant between the three groups. Conclusion : The effects of dietary flaxseed on glucose control and insulin resistance are inconsistent.

The current study aim ed to systematic ally review and analyze r and omized controlled trials assessing the impacts of flaxseed consumption on insulin sensitivity."
27278232," BACKGROUND. The aim of the study was to explore the association between alcohol consumption and menopausal development. The authors analyzed the follow-up data of women aged 18–40 years who were participating in the European Prospect i ve Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition ( EPIC ). We evaluated the effects of dietary, age of menopause, parity, social class, and alcohol consumption on the onset of  menopause. In an average of 5.4 years of observation, there were 2035 women who were premenopausal, with the median age of 51.3 years. The onset of menopause was defined using changes in menstrual characteristics.. We administered a semiquantitative food frequency question naire at enrollment to measure regular alcohol consumption during the past year... Among those women who reported surgical menopause, alcohol consumption was associated with an increased prevalence of irregular periods. High BMI, smoking, and caffeine and alcohol intake were associated with later onset of natural menopause. Compared to never smokers, current smokers have the risk of younger age at menopause, and the odds of menopause.. The results of this study suggest that the increasing prevalence of alcohol consumption in women is associated with longer reproductive years ( Ptrend < 0.01 for all ). Although we assume causality, among men and women, 10 % ( 95 % confidence interval 7 to 13 % ) and a positive association was observed with alcohol consumption.. Further studies including biological markers are needed to clarify these associations. CONCLUSION While there was no association between total alcohol intake and menopause, the age at which menopause occurs. Although alcohol intake has been suggested to affect the health of early menopause, we observed that alcohol intake was not consistent. The significant increase in plasma estradiol levels following moderate to heavy alcohol consumption may be associated with long-term health risks, including cardiovascular disease and premature death. In this systematic review, we aim to quantify the relationship between all levels of alcohol intake, and menopause onset, in this comprehensive review.A). and."
11279762," BACKGROUND The authors examined the incidence and causes of agitation states in patients with acute psychotic illness. Management guidelines, the preferred treatment of clinicians and clinical practice all differ. Systematic review s show that all relevant studies were small and none are likely to have adequate power to show true differences between treatments. For the survey, households were sample d in 720 postal code sectors nested within 177 district health authorities and 14 regional health authorities. Study subjects were adults aged 16 years or more.  ICCs and components of variance were estimated from a nested r and om-effects analysis of variance. Results were presented at the district health authority, postal code sector, and household levels. Between-cluster variation was evident at each level of clustering. In these data, ICCs were inversely related to cluster size, but the risk for other types of crimes was not elevated significantly. In non-pharmacological trials, one-third of'gold-st and ard'cl aims of treatment superiority would not have been made if published scales had been used. CONCLUSION Unpublished scales are a source of bias in schizophrenia trials... The design of this trial does not substantially complicate clinical management, and in several aspects simplifies it, though the study can be large. Clotiapine, a dibenzothiazepine neuroleptic, is being used for this purpose."

23633374," BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is a common arrhythmia in older people and a common cause of morbidity and mortality. The hazards for a GP are too many diagnostic interventions for worried well and too few diagnostics for potentially life threatening complaints. METHODS Over 40-year follow-up of the original 5070 Framingham cohort, 501 initial ischemic strokes, including 103 with AF, were analyzed.  AF  was diagnosed in 4.8 % of women and in 6.2 % of men at the baseline examination.. Consecutive patients with AF. The primary end point was overall mortality... Identification and appropriate treatment of AF.. The main outcome was the difference in incidence of atrial fibrillation. The study population was selected from one quartile, after ranking all framework practice s according to the small area st and ardised mortality ratio. The aim was to establish that pulse examination for potential AF could be performed by individuals with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be effectively used as a screening procedure. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio for 30-day mortality for AF subjects was 1.84 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.3 to 3.27 ). The majority of patients in the intervention group were taking aspirin..  The screening programme for AF in asymptomatic patients was significantly higher than the control group.. A technique for detecting the presence of AF, the proportion of patients who would benefit from prophylactic anticoagulation therapy ( RR 3.2, 95 % CI 1.5 to 6.8 ). Conclusion Patient-activated loop recorders are feasible and effective diagnostic tools in clinical practice and there were no significant differences in screening programmes compared to routine practice. The secondary objectives were to identify which combination of screening strategy and patient population is most effective, as well as assessing any safety issues associated with screening, its acceptability within the target population and the costs involved."

The study was conducted to evaluate the effect of vitamin D added to calcium supplements on bone turnover. The placebo group was compared with 25 women who took 800 mg ( as calcium lactate gluconate ). The follow-up period was 6 months. The treated group was similar in baseline age, years postmenopause ( 3.3 in the calcium citrate group vs 2.7 in placebo group ). After the 6 months of intervention, the BMD ( BMC ) and lumbar spine ( LBMD ) were evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. In the placebo group, there was a tendency toward a slowed loss of bone mass ( 2.8 % after two years ), whereas it declined significantly in those who received calcium supplement. The percentage change in BMD at the bone level was similar ( P = 0.0061 ). There were no differences between the citrate and placebo group ( D ), but the treatment group ( 0.02 % ), and after the same period.. The BMD was preserved in all the patients.

The system consists of a preoperative planning computer workstation ( called ORTHODOC ) and a five-axis robotic arm with a high speed milling device as an end effector. The combined experience of the United States Food and Drug Administration multicenter trial and the German postmarket use of this system are reported. The United States study is controlled and r and omized with 136 hip replacements performed at three centers ( 65 ROBODOC ® and 62 control ). Followup was 1 year on 127 hip replacements and 2 years on 93 hip replacements. No differences were found in the Harris hip scores or the Short Form Health Survey outcomes question naire. Length of stay also was not different, but the surgical time and incidence of Trendelenburg's sign ( according to the Kuhfuss-classification ). Two intraoperative femoral fractures occurred only in manual rasping group.. Radiographs were evaluated by an independent bone radiologist and showed statistically better fit and positioning of  the femoral component after the robotic-assisted THA. No complications including stem loosening, infection, nerve palsy, or dislocation were encountered in either group during the follow-up period. Conclusions The present study suggested that robot-assisted short stem THA could increase the accuracy of stem alignment, improve leg length e quality, and help reduce the risk of intraoperative femoral fracture. The clinical outcome scores did not differ between the two groups. The safe zone ( inclination, 30 ° –50 ° ; anteversion, 5 ° –25 ° ), the incidence of complications ( CASPAR : two dislocations, one sciatic paresis, one deep infection ; conventional : one dislocation, two fissures ).

31933471," BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation ( AF )  is more likely to be fatal or more severe than non-AF stroke based on clinical series. The Cochrane Collaboration ’s tool for assessing risk of recurrence of AF in patients receiving stable antiarrhythmic therapy remains uncertain. METHODS In 110 patients with a class I indication for physiologic pacing and a history of AF, a pacemaker with dedicated functions for AF detection and electrogram storage was implanted. Since 1981, functional status indicated by the Barthel index has been evaluated acutely and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Compared with symptomatic patients, asymptomatic patients were more often men and had a lower incidence of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure, but had more cerebrovascular events. The incidence of AF recurrences lasting > 48 h in patients undergoing AF treatment, cardiovascular outcomes, stroke or non- central nervous system embolism, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS Overall, 4293 of the cohort ( 42 % ) were female. Prospect i ve identification of pre-existing risk factors for AF within the screened population enabled comparison between targeted screening of people at higher risk of AF and total population screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AF detection rates in systematic ally screened and opportunistically screened population s in the intervention practice s were compared with AF detection rate in 5000 patients at subsequent follow-up. The AF subjects had lower mean Barthel index scores acutely ( 29.6 versus 58.6, P <.001 ) and at 6 months ( P =.005 ), but not at 12 months (.

The participants were divided into two groups : group ( 1 ) control group and group ( 2 ) the patients were remotely monitored and received office follow-up. The control group received a notebook computer, glucose and blood pressure monitoring devices, and access to a care management website. The mean ( ±SD ) follow up was 348 ( ±78 ) and 349 ( ±84 ) days. The intervention participants received a home blood pressure monitor and training on use, whereas control participants received usual care. After 9 months, systolic blood pressure decreased ( intervention, 14.7 mm Hg, to 14.1 mm Hg ; P<0.001 ). The primary outcome was the percentage of patients in both groups with controlled blood pressure. The secondary outcomes were: the proportion of patients with controlled BP. The baseline to follow the intervention group ( C : -13.9 vs. -1.2 % ; P = 0.007 ). In the control group the mean BP was similar to the baseline. The intervention group had a more pronounced night dipping and a higher reduction of mean pulse pressure than controls ( P < 0.01. The number of phone contacts was as efficacious as the usual care group in reducing BP, systolic BP ( T : -19.9 ± 20.9 ) and diastolic BP (.A+).-./ )"

This study examined the impact of exercise on circulating levels of leptin, high molecular weight adipocectin ( HMWA ), and leptin in obese subjects. The participants were 55 overweight women, mean ( SE ) age 42.75 ( 1.64 ) years, who completed both baseline and posttesting. The youths were r and omized to exercise.. The BMI, low-density lipoprotein, cortisol, leptin and insulin levels were collected at baseline and 16 weeks... Baseline leptin was positively associated with fat mass. The subjects were randomized into exercise group and control group. The exercise group experienced a significant decrease in BMI, waist circumference, and fat mass, while the control group did not change significantly. The study showed that exercise intervention was associated with decreased serum leptin. The intervention group was significantly correlated with the baseline leptin levels, but not to the exercise group. The weight loss goal for the two Diet groups was 5 % from baseline at 18 months.. Results A dose-dependent decrease in total WBC counts ( trend P = 0.002 ) was observed with a significant increase in the 12KKW group ( −163.1±140.0 cells/µL ; mean±95%CI ). The observed robust, prospect i ve associations were observed in obese individuals. A similar response was seen in terms of insulin resistance, but the level of serum leptonectin..

DHEA is promoted for and used by patients with menopausal symptoms. The primary purpose was to assess whether DHEA affects the influence of moderate/severe pain at sexual activity ( dyspareunia ), the effects on the central nervous system ( CNS ). The postmenopausal women were r and omized to a 12-week course of oral DHEA ( 300 mg ) or placebo for 12 weeks.. The study subjects were 60 women with menopause. All participants gave informed consent to participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy of DHEA. The mean serum DHEA, total and bioavailable testosterone, estradiol, and urine levels were compared with placebo. The increase in the 4-week frequency of satisfying sexual episodes was significantly greater in women receiving 300 microg of testosterone per day than in those having placebo. In women only, significant interaction effects were observed for sexual arousal ( p<0.05 ), libido, and the total body weights. In premenopausal women, DHEA did not influence BMD significantly. There was a significant increase in overall satisfaction... the study showed that the DHEA dose led, but not the placebo, to an improvement in menopausal symptoms ( P = 0.0001 ). In the postmenopausal women, the ratio of estrogen and testosterone levels was increased by 68 % ( P= 0.006 ), while the arousal/lubrication domain by 39 % (. ), and a decrease in estrogen levels..

24406123," The Shoulder Disability Question naire ( SDQ ) is a measure covering 16 items design ed to evaluate functional status limitation in patients with shoulder disorders. The purpose of this study was to compare prospect ively the validity of five question naires in the assessment of shoulder pain. The study was performed in western Sweden, in a region with 24 000 inhabitants. Subjects included adults who reported current shoulder pain in a population survey and patients from three general practice s who attended with shoulder symptoms during a six month period. The main outcome measures were : frequency of problems with daily living related to shoulder symptoms, total score on 22-item disability question naire, and measures of shoulder movement. RESULTS --A higher proportion ( 80 % ) of patients attending their general practitioner with shoulder pain had the same scores as those of the shoulder Impact Measurement Scales 2. The scale was validated by analysing the differences between the scores in each domain with the level of satisfaction in that domain and by significantly lower scores in domains that patients selected as areas important for improvement. The over-all scale and each domain were internally consistent ( Cronbach alpha, 0.71 to 0.90 ). The mean healthcare cost per patient was the most efficient in distinguishing patients who said that their shoulder was much better from all other patients. The accuracy and clinical usefulness of our shoulder outcome instruments and individual domains was excellent ( Guyatt responsiveness index = 1.12 ).. The discriminative ability for the outcome measures was satisfactory with an area under the curve of 0.70 ( 95 % CI 0.64–0.76 )."

We sought to evaluate whether the treatment recommendations given to ischemic heart disease patients at hospital discharge are compatible with the guidelines of the Israeli medical societies and the U.S. National Cholesterol Education Program. The aim of this study was to determine outcomes three years after the initial intervention. We also evaluated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) goal attainment ( 1486 plan sponsors with 3010 patients ). The cross-sectional FOCUS ( Fixed-Dose Combination Drug for Secondary Cardiovascular Prevention ) study ( Phase 1 ) aim ed to eluci date factors that interfere with appropriate adherence to CV medications for secondary prevention. We assessed the impact of full prescription coverage on adherence, clinical outcomes, and healthcare costs using adjusted models. RESULTS Patients who underwent CABG surgery were eligible for inclusion in the study. The exclusion criteria were as follows : contraindications to statin therapy ; refusal to take a statin drug.. After a median of 18 months, the polypill-based strategy was associated with greater use of combination treatment ( 70 % vs. 47 % ; relative risk 1.49, ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.30 to 1.72 ). We were able to predict the following outcomes. Secondary prevention is cost-effective for cardiovascular disease ( CVD ), but uptake is suboptimal. Underst and ing barriers and facilitators to secondary prevention for CVD at multiple health system levels may inform policy. CONCLUSIONS : The historical  control group ( 202 subjects ) and  the intervention group ( 201 subjects ) were similar with respect to adherence/persistence to primary CVD prevention medications at health system level.

We investigated the complication rate in 1,000 AF ablation procedures in a high-volume center and examined possible risk factors. METHODS AND RESULTS One thous and consecutive circumferential pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) were performed for symptomatic, drug-refractory AF.  We evaluated 40 patients affected by LV dysfunction with ejection fraction ( EF ) < 40 % and compared them to the remaining 65 patients with normal ventricular function. We evaluated the patients'left ventricular function and dimensions, symptom score, exercise capacity, and quality of life at baseline and at 6 months after PVI. RESULTS After a mean follow-up of 14+/-2 months, 87 % of patients with impaired LV function and 92 % of controls were in sinus rhythm.. Patients with depressed LVEF had higher LV end diastolic diameter ( 55.6 ± 6.2 vs. 52.4 ± 5.5, P = 0.03 ). The RFA group had a greater increase in EF, than patients in the medical treatment group ( 60 % vs. 32.6 %, P < 0.001 ), and the group that underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing...

26546969," Background —Statins may exert important pleiotropic effects, ie, improve endothelial function, independently of their impact on LDL cholesterol. In this experiment, the mood of 44 healthy young women ( all oral contraceptive users ) was examined. A double-blind, r and omized, placebo-controlled time series paradigm was used. We investigated the in vivo effects of simvastatin treatment in hypercholesterolemic patients and the influence of various statins on expression of cellular adhesion molecules, and so the explanation for a possible increase in non-cardiac mortality must be sought elsewhere. RESULTS : In the first period ( 24 weeks ), lovastatin was increased at 8 and 16 mg/kg, and placebo for 24 weeks. The study was conducted between 1990 and 1994. Baseline values of lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteids ( apo ) were comparable between treatment groups. After stress exposure, there were significant but clinical ly insignificant decline in serum testosterone levels and unrelated with the increase in serum dehydroepi and rosterone levels.. Pravastatin führte zu einer signifikanten Reduktion der Serumkonzentration des Gesamtcholesterins und des LDL-Cholesterins. Signifikante Veränderungen von Östradiol, Testosteron, Cortisol, and DHEAS wurden nicht beobachtet.. The primary efficacy outcome measure was low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ). Primary safety measures were 15.5 % in the placebo group and 11.8 % in the pravastatin group ( P<0.001 ).

23796797," This study examined the association of the dopamine D2 receptor gene ( DRD2 ) with treatment response to smoking cessation. We performed a clinical trial of two genetic variants in the nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ), and that this association may only be present in smokers. We investigated whether the genetic polymorphism in  the DRD2 receptor genes are associated with smoking cessation outcomes in a placebo-controlled trial. The genotype × treatment interaction effect at 12-week follow-up indicated that bupropion ( vs placebo ) predicted increased odds of abstinence. The main effect of Genotype was not significant. A genotypic × Treatment interaction ( P=0.005 ) showed that smoking cessation  was associated with the presence of a significant treatment effect on the 2-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. All participants had a significant male-specific marginal association with smoking abstinence ( odds ratio (OR)=1.91, 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.3–3.60 ). The results also indicate a sex difference in smoking behaviour. We found an interaction of ARRB2 and OPRM1 genotype on smoking cessation at 6 months that approached significance. Several sources have confirmed the implication of genomic factors in smoking behavior. These factors interact both with environmental factors and interventions to develop a certain behaviour..Conclusion : Smoking behaviour is a major public health problem worldwide... The 1,000 SNPs identified in this study may influence the likelihood of smoking cessation, and developing a working model incorporating the different factors influencing SC were our main objectives."

The overall incidence of stroke varies widely among patients with NRAF, but the absolute rate of stroke differs widely among the population aged 65 years and over, as well as its prevalence and incidence in this age group. OBJECTIVES To analyze risk factors associated with ischemic stroke in AF patients taking aspirin. The study included patients with AF. We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis of 2012 participants given aspirin alone or in combination with low, inefficacious doses of warfarin in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation I-III trials followed for a mean of 2.0 years. The participants who attended at least one of the two examinations were termed responders and those who attended none nonresponders. The cases of first-ever stroke were collected from the National Patient Register, and the database.. The rate of major bleeding while receiving aspirin was 2.3 % per year ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 1.7 to 3.0 ). Major bleeding occurred more frequently in patients > 75 years of age ( 6 events, 5.1 % per month ) than in younger patients ( 5 events, 1 to 2.9 % ). There was no significant difference between the age- and sex-adjusted rates of stroke. The age group ( mean ( SD ), the incidence of those with AF, that is, 1.6 %, 2.8 %, and 2.5 % ), of stroke and that of patients aged 75 years and older ( adjusted rate ratio=1.8, 95 % CI, 1-2.8 )..

The aim of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of a minimal intervention strategy aim ed at assessment and modification of psychosocial factors and usual care for treatment of (sub)acute low back pain. The present study examines the relationship between persistent MUPS in general practice on the one hand and and quality of life, social conditions, and coping.. The study was design ed as a cluster r and omised and simple blind trial.. A total of 164 patients with subacute back pain were recruited and omized to a  mini-intervention group ( A ), a work site visit group ( B ), or a usual care group ( C ). The final 3-predictor model included job satisfaction, mental health and social support. The accuracy of the model was 72 %, with 81 % of nonpersistent and 60 % of persistent LBP patients correctly identified. The outcome was compared between the groups. The majority of patients ( MISS n = 227, usual care [ UC ] n = 206 ), pain varied between mild and high levels.. Measures of patient centeredness did not perform well in this study..Conclusion : Primary health care providers ( HCPs ) have been linked to poor prognosis of LBP.. Conservative therapeutic strategies, mainly focused on biomechanical factors, have had moderate and short-term impact. The targeted treatments. The more experienced the doctor is, the less he perceives patients as'difficult ', as he learns to accept greater diversity of behaviours in LBP. The psychosocial factors. Non-specific lumbar pain ( LBP ) affects many people and has major socio-economic consequences. Traditional theraputic strategies.. Primary care providers  have been associated with poor prognosis and they are increasingly considered as promising targets for management of LBP, including consideration of psychosocial dimensions.

This study involved primary TKA cases being performed with PSCG between 10/05/2010 and 05/03/2013 and then followed prospect ively. The hypothesis was that the postoperative alignment between patients treated with PSI and conventional instrumentation. A group of 112 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in this study and r and omized to the outcomes. The experimental group was used as an intraoperative control. When the tibial component was not performed completely with the PSCG as initially planned. The sample size calculation was performed in 76 % of  the studies, but reported in only 16 % of papers.. The preoperative HKA in the included cases was not significantly different between the groups. Postoperative alignment between groups on postoperative long alignment radiographs ( P=0.77 ). The accuracy achieved with different types of guides during the TKA, the operative time was compared in two groups ( p = 0.019 ). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in respect to coronal and sagittal component positioning and overall coronal alignment.. In the study, the percentage of patients who achieved the planned position was comparable between groups ( 7 % versus 14 % ). P > 0.05. The robotic procedures as an alternative to conventional TKA is not advisable. The postoperative alignment was achieved in 50 % of patients ( 171–185 ) and the overall alignment was within ±3 °.

Antimuscarinics are prescribed to treat urinary tract symptoms ( LUTS ) and patients ( ‘ responders ). OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy of a combination of solifenacin ( P ) and an oral controlled absorption system ( OCAS ). Patients presenting with an initial episode of spontaneous AUR underwent urethral catheterization and then prospectively r and omized 1:1:1 to combination treatment ( p = 0.001 ) and placebo. The primary end point was to demonstrate changes in urodynamic variables in the voiding phase, total International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS ), and maximum flow rate ( Qmax ), from baseline to week four. Patients who voided successfully were followed at least for three months. RESULTS Compared with placebo, men assigned to doxazosin and combination reduced significantly ( p less than 0.01 ) the urinary incontinence complaints. Twelve women ( 43 % ) preferred combined treatment compared with the baseline. IPSS and mean residual urine were comparable between the 2 groups. In the 4th week, the two groups were comparable in terms of IPSS total score and Qmax, and the incidence of OAB symptoms. The mean difference in Qmax between groups was not significant..

32149404," BACKGROUND : Despite recent advances in the treatment of children with congenital heart disease ( CHD ), their neurodevelopmental outcome remains a major concern. We explored the impact of the surgical approach on perinatal and perioperative variables and on outcomes at 1 year of age. METHODS : In the Boston Circulatory Arrest Study, 135 children with D-transposition of  the great arteries who underwent an arterial switch operation were included. Follow-up clinical, neurologic, and developmental outcomes were obtained from the Western Canadian Complex Pediatric Therapies follow-up Program data base.. Developmental and neurologic outcomes were assessed at 21.1 ± 2.5 months of age with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition Mental Developmental Index, and Psychomotor Developmental index ( PDI ). Patients with univentricular heart scored significantly lower than control subjects only on the gross motor domain ( P = 0.026 ), and those assigned to low-flow bypass. All 1-year test scores had poor sensitivity ( 16%–32 % ) and poor positive predictive value ( 35%–42 % ). At 1 year, there were no differences in cognitive, 4.2 % ( CI 2.3%–6.1 % ) ; the mean ( SD ) mental and psychomotor developmental indices were 79 ( 18 ) and 67 ( 19 ). The performance of those with low-dose chemotherapy was significantly worse than the control group. The incidence of cerebral palsy was higher than controls.. The number of re-operations ( OR ) 2.2, 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.1 - 4.3. The 2-year mortality rate ( P=0.002 ) and the psychomotor developmental index ( PD ) of infants up to 24 months and IQs of preschool-aged children to adolescents. The diagnosis, a clinical seizure history, and increased plasma lactate levels after the operation were significantly associated with poorer outcomes. and.."
23360949," There are no empirically supported psychosocial treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ). The present study examined the treatment benefits of the Challenging Horizons Program ( CHP ), a psychosocial treatment program. Twenty children were r and omly assigned to either a parent training ( PT ) or placebo control group. In addition to evaluating social and academic functioning outcomes, two critical questions from previous studies pertaining to the efficacy of ADHD : EEG neurofeedback ( NF ), and the Self-Control Rating Scale ( SCRS ), parent ratings on the Modified Werry Weiss Activity Scale.  Measures of child symptoms and mothers'well-being were taken before and after intervention and at 15 weeks follow-up. Due to unreturned question naires, data were only available for 104 children. The two active training conditions were compared with placebo.. The results indicate that ADHD. The authors undertook meta-analyses of ADHD symptoms, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and a Go/No-Go task, but a clear benefit from PUFA treatment groups compared with the placebo group.. For most outcomes, children in the combined treatment and medication management groups showed significantly greater improvement than those given intensive behavioral treatment alone."
27489205," OBJECTIVES The aims of this study were to assess the feasibility of the  Atraumatic Restorative Treatment ( ART ) approach in primary teeth and to compare the ART approach with traditional amalgam restorations in primary molars. Material s and methods A controlled clinical trial using a parallel group design was carried out on 258 children aged 6 through 10 years old, allocated to two treatment groups : conventional restorative treatment using amalgam and ART using high-viscosity glass ionomer. A total of 364 amalgam restorations and 386 ART restorations were placed by three pedodontists in 126 and 154 children, respectively, and were evaluated after 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 years. The proportional hazard rate regression model with frailty correction, ANOVA and Wald tests, and the Jackknife procedure were applied in analysing the data. RESULTS The cumulative survival rates over 3 years for all, single- and multiple-surface CRT/amalgam restorations ( 72.6 % ) and ART ( 73.5 % ). The difference was no different from those of comparable ART/HVGIC restorations ( 66.8 % ; 90.1 % and 56.4 %, respectively ). Effectiveness was measured using percentage of restorations that survived after a year. The single-surface restorations had higher survival rates than multiple‑surface restorations for the both treatment procedures ( p<0.0001 ). A higher proportion of restorations failed because of mechanical reasons ( 94.8 percent ) than of secondary caries ( 5.2 % ),. Conclusion To up date the existing systematic review and address questions regarding survival rate of ART restorations compared to conventional approach in occlusoproximal cavities in primary dentolars."
22992251," BACKGROUND The risk of recurrent neural-tube defects  is decreased in women who take folic acid or multivitamins containing such during the periconceptional period. The aim of this work was to assess the relationship between maternal nutrition and birth size in a prospect i ve study of 797 rural Indian women, focusing on macronutrient intakes, dietary quality and micronutrient status.. The diets of pregnant women from Spain ( n = 500 ) were supplemented with modified fish oil and /or 5-MTHF or placebo, and assigned in a r and om, double-blind manner to one of the four groups. Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were used to detect placental proliferation and apoptosis with monoclonal antibodies for key proteins that reflected the extent of both processes..  Maternal zinc intakes were lower than UK and US recommended amounts. There was a small but significant positive association between maternal folate intake and adjusted infant birthweight ( 7.0 + /- 2.0 MJ and 43.5 +/- 13.5 g ). The indirect measures of maternal nutritional status including maternal pre-pregnancy weight ( beta = 8.0, p = 0.0001 ) and weight gain during pregnancy ( β = 18.1, p < 0.001 ).  Energy and protein intakes  were not associated with birth size, but higher fat intake at wk 18 was associated with the 90th-10th percentile difference for the trace-element supplement than in the vitamin-supplement group... Folic acid supplementation starting before pregnancy can now be firmly recommended for all women who have had an affected pregnancy.  Folate intake, although significantly associated with birthweight, was a weak predictor while the dose – response relationship between folate intake, and health outcomes. The beneficial effect of folate supplementation on birth weight, but may be a consequence of other multivitamin components, or some unknown behaviors that highly correlate with regular use of a multivitaminosis.."
29453672," BACKGROUND : The aim of this study was to investigate the significance of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) on the insulin resistance ( IR ) and adiponectin in individuals with type 2 diabetes.. The present study aimed to compare the effect of two dietary intervention, i.e., placebo, on insulin sensitivity, adipose tissue function ( production of adipokines and inflammatory and atherogenic factors ), and gene expression. Methods and Results : We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis study of r and omly assigned to the group that took Omega-3 capsules or control group with placebo capsules. In the first step, study subjects filled a question naire collecting their age, height, weight, waist circumference, and hip circumference. The same result was found when plasma leptin was adjusted by total fat mass, as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. We also showed significant increase in fasting and postprandial serum leptin, insulin, and visceral fat rating ( p = 0.02 ). In contrast, all markers except for adiponectinemia were decreased significantly in diabetic patients with high Ang-2 levels. The secondary outcome measures were fasting circulating leptin and adipocectin levels and parameters regarding glucose and lipid metabolism were assessed at baseline, during and after the intervention. The study was conducted at an academic medical center. The ALA group improved serum levels of leptin in patients with T2DM, but not in the placebo group. In addition, the mean difference between the serum visfatin level before and after a 6-month intervention in both groups was significant ( p < 0.001 ). Given the contradictory effects of N-3 PUFsAs on serum levels, particularly of adipokines, we conducted the following study: (1)... We found the negative effects of PUFA on circulating levels of inflammatory and non-inflammatory adipokines in type II diabetes, we analyzed the effects of three different."
28063111," BACKGROUND Catheter ablation of the pulmonary veins ( PVs ) is a promising therapeutic approach for symptomatic atrial fibrillation ( AF ). The purpose of this prospect i ve pilot study was to compare the efficacy and safety of cryoballoon ( CB ) versus radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation of pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ). METHODS AND RESULTS In this multicenter, retrospective, nonr and omized analysis, 20 patients with paroxysmal AF were enrolled. The cohort was divided into 2 groups.  Diffusion weighted MRI was acquired pre- ( n = 20 ) and 24 - 48 h postablation.  The primary endpoint was successful ablation, the median age was 63.0 [ interquartile range, 57–68 ] years. In the CB group, a mean of 5.3 ± 1.4 applications/patient was delivered. The proportion of ERAF was similar between the groups. The time-course patterns were similar in the RFCA group... The overall success rate was 55 % ( 97.5 % in  the CRYO group, and 76 % of persistent AF subjects were free from AF at 12 months after a single procedure.. There were no significant differences between CB and RF groups ( P = 0.05 ). While the plasma level of beta-TG, F1 + 2, and TAT were elevated after RF ablation. The mean ± SD of catheter ablation was similar in cryo- ( 4.6 % ) and RF-ablation ( 6.1 % ). Procedural and fluoroscopic times were similar between CB- and RF ablation ( 2.1 ± 0.8 minutes, P < 0.001 ). Conclusion The safety and efficacy of RF and CB ablation are two frequently used methods for pulmonary venous isolation in PAF, but which is a better choice for PAF remains uncertain.. and).-, } "
30627080," BACKGROUND The proportion of overweight adolescents has increased, but the behavioral risk factors for overweight youth are not well understood. OBJECTIVE To examine how diet, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors relate to overweight status in adolescents. DESIGN AND SETTING Baseline data from the Patient-Centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise Plus Nutrition Project, a r and omized controlled trial of adolescents to determine the effects of a clinic-based intervention on physical activity and dietary behaviors. PARTICIPANTS A total of 878 adolescents aged 11 to 15 years, 42 % of whom were from minority background s. RESULTS : Minutes of sedentary, light, moderate, moderate-to-vigorous, and vigorous activity per day were calculated. Mean counts per minute were considered to reflect total physical activity. Pearson correlation coefficients indicated a weak relationship between daily physical activity variables and [Vdot]O2peak in boys ( r = 0.15–0.28, P < 0.05 ). This leads to misclassification on both exposure and outcome measures ( 15 ). These limitations may result in underestimation of the true association between sedentary habits and risk for type 2 diabetes. Impaired fasting glucose is a strong predictor of type 1 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other diabetic complications. Bivariate analyses indicated that girls and boys in the AR + O group did fewer minutes per day of vigorous physical activity ( VPA ), and had fewer total grams of fiber per day than those in those with normal-weight group. In this population -based cohort, most daily activity variables were positively related to aerobic fitness in boys, whereas less clear relationships were observed in girls.

26912127," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine ( QTP ) combined with lithium ( Li ) or divalproex ( DVP ) for the treatment of agitation in patients. The objective of this study was to determine whether the early response ( within the first 24 h ) in patients with agitation was similar to placebo. The study was conducted in a randomized controlled trial. The six-item BMSE was administered to 100 patients with psychotic agitation.. The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) score at day 21. The secondary outcome was the duration of the violent and acute behavioral disturbance. We used a clinical ly oriented proxy marker of efficacy, the necessity for additional medication intervention for agitation ( AMI ). The key secondary end-point was Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale ( CGI-I ) score 2 h after dose one. RESULTS Inhaled loxapine ( 5 and 10 mg ) significantly reduced agitation compared with placebo at day 7 ( -8.03 vs. -4.89 ; p <.01 ). Treatment groups were compared with an analysis of variance model which included treatment and site as factors.. During the 24-hour treatment period, safety was assessed by clinical examination and laboratory investigations, electrocardiograms, extrapyramidal symptoms scales, and recording spontaneously reported adverse events. CONCLUSIONS Of the 91 r and omized patients, 90 patients ( 45 IM olanzapine-group ; 45 IM placebo-group ) were in the full analysis set. The mean change of PANSS-EC total score from baseline to 2 hours after treatment was not univocal. Actually, an improper assessment and management may result in unnecessary coercive or sedative treatments. A thorough and balanced review plus an expert consensus can guide assessment and treatment decisions."
26917939," Purpose : Dysfunction of cervical and shoulder girdle muscles as reason of cervicogenic headache ( CEH ) was reinvestigated with clinical and neurophysiological studies. Methods : Forty office workers were r and omized into two groups  to verify efficiency of supervised kinesiotherapy  ( N = 20 ) aim ed with improvement of muscle ’s activity and headache symptoms releasing. Headache intensity was evaluated with visual analog scale ( VAS ), range of cervical movement ( ROM ) with goniometer, trigger points ( TrPs ) incidence with palpation and muscle ″s strength with Lovett ‰s scale. Assessment s included a  photographic measure of posture, rangeof movement, cervical manual examination, pressure pain thresholds, muscle length. Additionally, one therapist prior to neck motion assessment determined the dominant symptomatic cervical motion segment. Active cervical motion in each direction was identical between the cervicogenic and control groups. In contrast, average rotation in flexion was 44 degrees to each side in the asymptomatic group and 28 degrees towards the headache side in  the symptomatic group. Positive correlations between increase in rEMG amplitudes and high VAS scores, high-amplitude rEMG recordings incidence and increased number of TrPs were found. Conclusion : Cervicogenic headache is a specific type of headache that originates from the cervical spine and is typically chronic in nature. In those 24 subjects range of rotation during the flexion-rotation test was inversely correlated to headache severity. Diagnosis of CGH through manual examination is a more recent practice. To our knowledge, no systematic review of manual diagnosis of  CGH has been performed."
26806655," BACKGROUND Tadalafil has regulatory approval for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) and erectile dysfunction. We assessed whether the effects of treatment with tadalafil for lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of BPH ( LUTS/BPH ), in population subgroups, using pooled data from 4 international, r and omized, placebo-controlled studies in men with BPH. We therefore sought to further assess nocturia based on data integrated from four trials and placebo controlled studies. We also assessed relationships of baseline disease severity and prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) to outcomes. METHODS Baseline maximum urinary flow rate data were available on 1,371 men with a mean age of 63.1 years and end point data were collected in 44 patients ( Group C ). After a 2-week medication free run-in period, they were evaluated for International Prostatic Symptom Score ( IPSS ), International Index of Erectile Function score ( IIEF-EF ), and the overall severity of prostate cancer. Analysis of orgasm and ejaculation was post hoc based on the IIEF-Orgasmic Function ( I-OF ), IPSS- quality of life index ( p < 0.0001 ). In 7 patients with prostate cancer, the change was -0.3 and 0.7 ml per second ( p = 0.011 ) and secondary ( erectile function ( EF ). The adverse event profile was consistent with previous studies with no new safety findings. CONCLUSION Tadalafil for 8 weeks treatment was efficacious and well tolerated, with no change was 44.8 and 41.0 %, and with worsening was 13.9 and 11.5 %. CONCLUSIONS A small but significant improvement in total I-PSS score improvement ( 2.25 ) was derived from a direct treatment effect of 1.57 ( 70 % ) but not IIEF-Q10. Reduced HDL-cholesterol and elevated triglycerides were the only MetS factors significantly associated with PDE5-Is. The IIEF-IS and OS increased significantly at end point compared with placebo and toadalafil, and under treatment compared with the placebo and."

The clinical efficacy and safety of the angiotensin-receptor blockers ( ARBs ) in the treatment of PAD. We have previously shown that the efficacy of ramipril treatment was not affected by the presence of hypertension. In the current analysis, 2,420 consecutive patients with PAD at stage II or higher and treated with placebo ( n=4177 ). The primary endpoint was the initial claudication distance ( ICD ). In contrast, patients r and omized to intensive treatment with enalapril or nisoldipine. The secondary endpoint was death. Flow-mediated vasodilation ( FMD ), carotid intima-media thickness ( IMT ), and ankle-brachial index ( ABI ). This is the second up date of a Cochrane review first published in 2003. The improvement was more evident during administration of C plus T, whereas placebo administration induced a trend toward baseline values. In patients who received ramipril the mean arterial pressure was lower than placebo.. The study showed the following: 1) the mortality rate ( 2.6 % ). the renal function was not influenced by either treatment.. Renal function is a risk factor for PAD... Treatment for hypertension is not associated with the effects of PAD, but the incidence of PAD is not increased.. After the study, the majority of patients ( 57 % ) had PAD.

29474713," Background : Medication adherence to immunosuppressive medications adherence is crucial to prevent adverse clinical outcomes. An automated web-based system managing short message service ( SMS ) reminders is a telemedicine approach to optimise adherence among patients with CHD who received : ( 1 ) text messages ( TM ) for medication reminders and education, ( 2 ) educational TM only, or ( 3 ) No TM.  The SimCard study was a yearlong cluster-r and omized, controlled trial conducted in 47 villages ( 27 in China and 20 in India ). Subjects from Chengdu City, China, were equally r and omised to receive either automated SMS reminders before every intake of cardiac medications or traditional bottles of loose tablets. The primary outcome was the trial participants ’ experiences and responses to the SMS-text messages. Secondary outcomes were the heart functional status, and those with passive medication reminder devices. The intervention group was developed using a patient and provider centered design. The development framework utilized self-determination theory with iterative stages that were guided and refined based on patient/provider feedback. A 3-month proof-of-concept study was conducted in 20 hypertensive kidney transplant patients who had their medications prescribed. The SMS-content, the respectful tone and the delivery ( timing of reminders and topics ) were all highly valued. A subgroup who benefitted the most, were those who had been struggling with adherence due to high levels of personal stress. The study showed that the intervention appeared to improve medication adherence in patients with cardiovascular disease. The texts reminded 98/151 patients ( 65 % ) to be monitored with the medication tray reminders turned off."
26225902," This article reports the results obtained by combining data from the Northwick Park and Leicester r and omized controlled trials of citalopram. The study included 141 patients with a depressive disorder according to DSM IV criteria. The major neurobiological effect of trimipramine was the inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical ( HPA ) axis. The mean daily dose of Moclobemide was 297 mg and treatment lasted from two to four weeks. The patients ( 61 female and 24 male patients ) with psychotic depression were treated with either the combination of amitriptyline and perphenazine or with placebo. The efficacy was assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) and the Rating Scale for psychotic depression. The majority of patients ( 47 RIS ; 51 HAL/AMI ) who completed at least 3 weeks of treatment. The primary endpoint was not statistically significant. The total number of patients using concurrent medication was 12/138 ( 8.6 % ). In the primary outcome criteria patients on imipramine improved significantly better on the BPRS positive symptom subscale, than patients without medication resistance ( χ2 exact trend test=4.089, df=1, P=0.048 ). There was no significant difference in response to treatment between the 2 groups. The Hamilton ( HRSD ) and Montgomery-Asberg ( MADRS ) Depression Rating Scales were used to evaluate treatment response. The results of this trial are limited regarding the clinical efficacy of pharmacological treatments for patients with an acute psychotic depression :  antidepressant monotherapy, antipsychotic monotherapy, the combined use of an antidepressant and/or with placebo.2. To assess whether differences in efficacy of antidepressant monotherapy versus treatment in the current episode are related to non-response to prior treatment."
27113121," BACKGROUND Depression is common in individuals with depression. The present study is the first r and omized controlled trial to test the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids ( n-3 ) in the treatment of major depressive disorder ( MDD ). We investigated whether tryptophan, an amino acid with both antidepressant-augmenting and hypnotic effects, would benefit patients with depression at the beginning of treatment with fluoxetine.. : : Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of fluoxetine and a relatively low dose folic acid ( 1.5 mg/day ) versus placebo.. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in total score on Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( HAM-D ). The secondary outcome measures were the proportion of patients with complete remission.. Patients receiving fluoxetine showed a significantly better improvement of depression and a higher responder rate than those of the placebo group. The results suggest that oral application of a deficit oriented amino acid mixture can improve the response to antidepressants. The mean change in Hamilton Depression Rating scale scores over time ( F = 7.32 ; df 1,177 ; P = 0.008 ). There was no significant difference in baseline to week 6 ( P < 0.01 ) and the endpoint. The overall treatment effect size ( ES ) for depression was not significant. The adjunctive use of st and ardized pharmaceutical- grade nutrients, known as nutraceuticals, has the potential to modulate several neurochemical pathways implicated in depression. While many studies have been conducted in this area, to date no specialized systematic review ( or meta- analysis ) has been conducted."
26626069," BACKGROUND To evaluate the impact of a walking school bus ( PA ) program on  children and adolescents.  Active transportation, such as walking and cycling to school, is an opportunity for children to be physically active. The design was a controlled, quasi-experimental trial with consecutive cross-sectional assessment s. The setting was three urban, socioeconomically disadvantaged, public elementary schools ( 1 intervention vs. 2 controls ) in Seattle, Washington. The intervention groups were involved in a 12-wk physical activity self-monitoring and educative program. The outcome measures Physical activity in counts per minute ( cpm ) and during weeks 4 and 5 of the intervention ( time 2 ). The main outcome was the weekly rate of active commuting, and a secondary outcome was moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Pre- and post-intervention anthropometric and body composition measures were taken. Body fat ( −1.95 ± 2.6 % ) and fat mass ( −0.49 ± 1.0 kg ) were assessed using a series of 3 ( group assignment, time ) ANOVA. Where significant interactions were found, separate follow-up simple main effects tests were used. Results At postintervention, only the PED group had significantly increased their total activity as measured by a 4-d step count, when compared with the control group. The proportion of students ( n = 653 ) walking to the study site increased, with boys engaging in more MVPA and VPA than girls. The difference in PA levels was significant for younger elementary aged school children compared to older children. The study outcome measures were acceptable.. Children and adolescents are failing to meet current PA guidelines.. The PA levels decline as children move into adolescence...

30462233," BACKGROUND The use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD ) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality among patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death. The German DEVICE registry aims to add further information on this particular cohort. The prevalence of AF has taken epidemic proportions in the population with cardiovascular disease. The prognostic importance of the ICD therapy in patients with heart failure is limited. The aim was to assess the incidence of arrhythmias in a large cohort of patients with an ICD.. The incidence of ICD shocks that followed the onset of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were considered to be appropriate. METHODS AND RESULTS A retrospective analysis of prospect ively collected data of 300 ICD recipients ( mean [ SD ] age, 65 [ 11 ] years ; 84 % men ; 75 % primary prevention ICD ) was conducted. During the median follow-up time of 3 years, 297 ( 21 % ) patients experienced inappropriate ICD shocks. The patients with atrial fibrillation at baseline, compared to those in sinus rhythm, had greater all-cause mortality ( 35 % vs. 23 % ), and 13.2 % of SVA were self-terminated. In the subgroup analysis, AF was an independent predictor of mortality ( hazard ratio 1.62 per 10 % decrease, p = 0.001 ). The ICD shock was associated with a higher risk of mortality than in SR patients ( hazard ratios ( HR ) = 2.45 ; 95 % CI, 1.29 to 3.05 ; P=0.002 ).

21901722," BACKGROUND This study determined the effect of two organizational support processes, the provision of financial incentives for superior clinical performance and the availability of a  patient ( smoker ) registry and proactive telephone support system for smoking cessation. A controlled before- and -after design was implemented involving ten practice s of st and ard contract GPs, paid largely by capitation and fee-for-service, and ten salaried GP practice s. RESULTS Up-to- date coverage rates documented in the charts were compared to the experimental conditions "" control "" ( distribution of printed versions of smoking cessation guidelines ) and "" incentive "" ( financial incentive pay-out for reaching preset clinical performance targets ).  Ten clinics were r and omized to receive financial incentives combined with access to a central ized patient registry and intervention system ( "" registry "" ). Results : Self-reported smoking abstinence obtained at 12 months follow-up and patients'smoking cessation behaviors... There were no significant changes in quality of care reported by either group of patients between 2003 and 2007 for communication, nursing care, coordination, and overall satisfaction. Some aspects of access improved significantly for patients with chronic disease, but not for the r or om sample s of patients. Patients in both sample s reported seeing their usual physician less often and gave lower satisfaction ratings for continuity of care. Most scores were significantly higher in intervention vs usual care clinics with a history of being engaged.. The cost was substantially higher than the odds of cessation ( OR 4.77, 95 % CI 2.03 to 11.22 ). Conclusion : Providing cost-free effective drugs to patients along with improved training opportunities for general practitioners ( GPs ) is increasing in a number of countries. The use of blended payment schemes in primary care, including the use offinancial incentives to directly reward'performance'and'quality'is increasing the quality of healthcare. The review is to examine the role of blended payments schemes in Primary care.. the impact of the different types of payment - the Quality and Outcomes Framework ( QoF ) for primary care."
31166447," BACKGROUND The maximal calcium absorption in response to vitamin D has been proposed as a biomarker for vitamin D sufficiency. Between October 2004 and February 2005 a group of 750 women older than 50 years was r and omly selected from urban and rural areas in Guilan. The participants were interviewed to collect data on age, educational level, body weight, height, employment status, reproductive history, medications, history of illness.. In the first, in which participants were pretreated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25OHD ) , mean serum 25OHD concentration was 86.5 nmol/L. This should also reduce the number of fractures. In European studies, the decrease in falls could be attributed to an improvement in the muscle weakness that often accompanies vitamin D deficiency. In urban and Rural areas, 84.7 % and 79.5 % of the women had serum 25(OH) D levels less than 30 ng/ml, respectively. In fact the mean serum vitamin D levels and prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency was related to educational level in urban women. The urban women in whom the lowest educational level ( < 5 years schooling ) had a better vitamin D status than other educational groups. CONCLUSION Vitamin D deficiency among healthy young Saudi women of 25 - 35 years was 30 % and 55 % in women of > or = 50 years. The cubic regression model better fitted the relationships of BMD and bone turnover markers. Serum & bgr;-CTX levels were significantly higher in women with sustained osteoporotic fracture or vertebral fracture ( P = 0.006 and 0.012, respectively ). Knowledge of its true dimensions will allow us to design interventions and plan preventive measures that can have a significant impact on human health."
23126575," The clinical and radiographic outcomes of 100 consecutive primary total hip arthroplasties, each using a single design of the Harris-Galante type I acetabular component. The data collected represent a 26-year experience using practice surveillance ( preoperative and regular interval postoperative collection and analysis of outcomes. The average duration of follow-up was six years ( average, 7.1 years ). The majority of patients ( 92%) had excellent or good results. The mean age at the time of surgery was 57 years, with the majority of hips ( 92 % ) having aseptic loosening.. At the 2-year follow up, the hips fixed with poly-L-lactic acid screws  were significantly more than the others, with a mean of 104 months ( range, seventy-eight to 126 months ). Of concern was the high incidence of early migration of acetabular cups  and late aseptic revision.. We therefore performed 2 parallel systematic review s and meta-analyses to determine the association between early migration and late to the acetabular revision. The authors found that the average preoperative Harris hip score was 48 points, with an average pain score of 15 points and an average function score of 26 points. The overall survival rates that necessitated a revision operation included one deep hematogenous infection, one late periprosthetic fracture, and a 0.5-inch ( 1.27-centimeter ) limb-length discrepancy. There were no differences in migration data for the cups and the femoral stems.. Although the hip arthroplasty performed by our group had excellent results, the following:...

32322969," Background The prevalent raise of type 2 diabetes ( NAFLD ) is the most common chronic liver disease in the world. The use of synbiotics has been proposed as a probable management strategy for patients with T2DM. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of synbiotic yogurt on hepatic steatosis and liver enzymes as primary outcomes and on oxidative stress markers, adipokine concentration, and gut peptide concentration as secondary outcomes in patients with NASH. In this 24-wk, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were assigned to take either a placebo group or a placebo capsule for 28 weeks. Both groups were advised to follow a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the study, hepatic steatosis was lower in those who received probiotics. The mean difference between the placebo group and a significant increase in faecal L. acidophilus NCFM, the mean difference was significant. Changes in fasting blood glucose ( FBS ), liver enzymes, lipid profile, and body mass index ( BMI ). The probiotic group had a significant decrease in concentrations of liver transaminase ( ALT ), bilirubin, and that with sitagliptin-synbiotic was -13.52±4.16 mg/dL. Of the measured immune markers, PGE2 levels were different between treatments and IgA levels were only significant in symbiotic group compared to control. The study showed that the probiotic and control groups had similar changes in serum lipid profile. Conclusion The consumption of probiotics alone or combined with nutritional counseling seems superior to placebo alone for NASH treatment as it attenuates steatosis and may help to achieve weight loss. The results suggest that consumption of lactitol combined with K. acidophilus SCN may improve the metabolic profile. The present systematic review was the first to analyze the effect of syn probiotics on lipid profile ( P < 0.05 ).A+.). }"
30057608," BACKGROUND Extraction socket remodeling and ridge preservation strategies have been extensively explored. The primary aim of this 6-month r and omized, controlled, blinded, clinical study was to determine whether ridge preservation would prevent post- extraction resorptive changes as assessed by clinical and histologic parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS A thorough search in MEDLINE - PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials ( CENTRAL ) was conducted up to February 2011. Two virtual models obtained from cone beam computed tomography data before extraction and 4 months after healing were 3-dimenionally superimposed. Facial bone wall resorption, extraction socket remodeling features and ridge width preservation rate were determined and compared between the groups. RESULTS Thin facial bone wall result ed in marked resorption in both groups. The greatest palatal shifting distance of facial bone located at the coronal level in the control group.. Data from nine of these 14 studies could be grouped in two meta-analyses. Results from the meta-analysis showed a statistically significant greater ridge reduction in bone height for control groups as compared to test groups ( weighted mean differences, WMD = -1.47 mm ; 95 % CI [ -1,982, -0.953 ], while the width of the EXT group decreased from 9.1 + /- 1.0 mm to 6.4 + / - 2.2 mm ( P<0.05 ), a difference of 1.6 mm.

28577257," Background Vitamin D deficiency is a global health concern in athletes as well as the general population. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on serum 25(OH)D concentrations and physical performance of adolescent swimmers with vitamin D deficiency. The goal of the r and omized double-blind trial were to assess the effects of oral vitamin D3 supplementation on selected physical fitness and injury parameters in elite ballet dancers. Methods and Results : Fifty male and 48 female athletes ( 18–32 years ) were included in the study. Serum 25[OH]D and muscle function ( 1-RM bench press and leg press and vertical jump height ) were measured presupplementation, 6 and 12 weeks postsupplementation. Vitamin D supplementation was defined in accordance with the US Institute of Medicine guideline ( < 50 nmol/l ). Baseline vitamin D concentrations were low, but after 6 weeks of supplementation, subjects engaged in a significant increase in their vitamin D concentration. At baseline, 50 and 22 % of athletes had vitamin D insufficiency ( 6.4 ± 0.4 ng/ml ). At midpoint and endpoint, the vitamin D group had a significant decrease in serum vitamin D levels ( p < 0.001 ), with no effect on physical performance.. The study showed that the placebo group also sustained significantly less than the controls. The post- study eccentric exercise bout induced EIMD and DOMS, with higher muscle damage biomarkers measured in vitD2 compared to placebo ( p = 0.04 ). The 2nd and 3rd week supplementation in athletes had no significant effect on the mean daily vitamin D intake, strength or swimming performance. Conclusion There is currently no systematic review of vitamin d supplementation  among athletes. A rigorous systematic review and meta- analysis is important to provide a balanced view of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. and.A). })"
31827125," BACKGROUND Dietary interventions can alter the inflammatory response in diabetic patients. The effect of a low – glycemic index ( GI ) ) on the atherosclerotic disease ( n-3 fatty acids ) is believed to play a role in cardiovascular diseases. The study was designed to investigate the effects of a fatty fish ( FF ) or a lean fish ( LF ). The subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 6 of whom had retinopathy, were recruited from the Royal Perth Hospital diabetic clinic. After screening, subjects were divided into three groups. Six of the subjects without retinopathy were r and omly selected and allocated to a control group. The remaining 16 patients ( mean ± SD : 4.3 ± 0.4 portions of fish per week ), and 160 women discontinued their usual dietary patterns.. The intestinal lipoproteins were quantified by the fasting concentration of apolipoprotein B48. The men with an end point were more often seropositive for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans IgA ( 15.5 % versus 10.2 %, P < 0.05 ). There was a significant rise in the levels of triglycerides ( TG ), HDL, and the triglyceride/HDL cholesterol ratio. In the control group, however, the decrease in arachidonic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid ( AA : C : E ), total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and fasting blood sugar ( FBS ) were observed. The study regimen consisted of an initial 8 weeks of open-label simvastatin 40 mg/d and dietary counseling, but the change in LDL -cholesterol, and HbA1c. The highest RR of 2.1 ( 1.3 to 3.4 ), was observed in patients with diabetes mellitus. The main outcome measure was the percent change in non-HDL-C from baseline to the end of treatment...

Patients were stratified by baseline severity of ED ( n=4262 ) and to take placebo, or 10 or 20 mg vardenafil.  Efficacy was measured after 12 weeks using the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function ( IIEF-EF ), diary questions measuring vaginal penetration and intercourse success rates, and a global assessment question ( GAQ ). The 3 co- primary end points were changes from baseline in the IIEF-AF domain score and penile length. In Group 1 there was significant decrease in penile measurements at month 3 compared to placebo. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of successful sexual intercourse attempts ( completed to ejaculation ). There were no significant differences between postoperative months 6 and 12 for all measurements. In this post-hoc meta- analysis of two observational studies with equal design, pooled data were analyzed to determine the treatment outcomes and PDE5 inhibitor prescribed/used most likely to be associated with patient expectations, satisfaction, self-esteem, and patient – partner relationships.

RESULTS This double‐masked, placebo‐controlled trial included patients of at least 24 weeks'gestation undergoing cesarean deliveries for various indications. Patients were r and omized to receive either cefazolin ( group A ) or placebo before the operation. All women received spinal anesthesia, at which time a sample of cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for analysis. The occurrence of endometritis, wound infection, total infectious morbidity, and neonatal complications were compared. RESULTS Twenty patients ( 15.0 % ) met the criteria for postpartum endometritis.. Secondary outcomes included intra-abdominal abscess formation, septic pelvic thrombophlebitis, pneumonia, or urinary tract infection. The study population was 56 % black, 25.5 ± 6.2 years of age, and 43 % nulliparous. The groups were similar ( P >.05 ) for maternal serum azithromycin levels. Of 44 patients with a positive postoperative culture, 26 ( 59.1 % ) also had Gram stain positive for polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the uterine cavity fluid. In the latter group, 2 wound infections and 1 case of endometritis occurred ( P =.030 ). The relative risk of having a positive culture on postoperative day 3 - 5 if the culture at surgery was positive at any site was 15.6 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 5.9, 42.2 ), and it was 19.5 ( 95 percent CI 6.8, 57.8 )."
26120361," BACKGROUND Children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) are at high risk for developing significant anxiety.  This study tested a modular cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) program for children with ASD ). A total of 32 children ( ages 8–16 years old ) with ASD and clinical ly significant anxiety  were r and omly assigned to either of the programs ( nCBT = 36 ; nSR = 34 ). Measures on child and parent groups were run in parallel, for seven weekly sessions, under the supervision of experienced psychologists.. A 16 % improvement in ASD social impairment ( within-group effect size = 1.18 ) was observed on a parent-reported scale. Although anxiety symptoms declined by 26 %, the change was not statistically significant. These findings suggest that CBT intervention is a feasible treatment modality and further evaluation is warranted.  Children ( N = 53 ; 31 males ; 7.8 - 13.8 years of age ). This meta- analysis aim ed to systematic ally evaluate the evidence for the use of psychosocial interventions to manage anxiety in this population.

25721432," Objective : To evaluate the effects of a cognitive-motor exercise program on gait and the ability of dual-task performance in older adults with knee osteoarthritis. Design : A r and omized controlled trial with two groups : a walking group and a control group. We conducted a tablet-based system, which included progressive strength and balance training supplemented by dance video gaming for 12 weeks. The intervention group performed a twice-weekly, 12-week multicomponent exercise program composed of muscle power training ( 8–10 repetitions, 40–60 % of the one-repetition maximum ). The outcome measures were tested in measures of gait speed, paired-associates learning, executive control, reasoning, memory span, and gait speed. The exercise group received a 6-week cognitive-task training program ( DT ), while the control group was a waitlist control. Other outcomes included gait velocity, stride length, test-retest and inter-rater reliability ( Spearman correlation coefficient and sign rank test ; kappa statistics ), criterion validity, and respondent burden. RESULTS : The improvement in the DT walking test, participants walked individually at a comfortable speed while carrying a ball on a tray. The walking group had significant differences for gait velocity ( U = 26, P =.041, r =.45 ) and for single support time ( p = 0.042 ). Dual-task interference during walking can substantially limit mobility and increase the risk of falls. The study showed that the intervention group showed improvements in gait speed ( p < 0.01 ) and mobility while performing concurrently a cognitive task ( p= 0.067 ). Previous systematic review s examining intervention effects on single-task gait and mobility have not assessed relative dual task performance or the type of control group. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine whether there are differences in treatment-related changes in gait and performance during walking among community-dwelling older adults."

The study was to assess the efficacy of a lifestyle intervention program, carried out in a primary healthcare setting using existing re sources, to reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Japanese with impaired glucose tolerance. The results of 3 years'intervention are summarized. Methods We evaluated the impact of a group-based DPP lifestyle intervention on fasting plasma glucose values, glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ), serum lipid levels, and Diabetes Risk Score. The subjects in the control group were recruited and r and omized to the intervention group or control group. The intervention was carried out for 3 years by public health nurses using the curriculum and educational material s provided by the study group. After 1 year, the DPP-based behavioral weight-loss intervention was delivered by lifestyle coach-led small groups or home-based DVD. A total of 262 ( 86 % ) participants completed a 5-month weight measurement. In intention-to-treat analysis with imputation of missing observations, mean weight loss at 5 months for both treatment groups combined was 3.3 % ( 95 % CI 0.7 - 5.0 % ), and health access ( insurance and self-reported health ). In this small pilot study, changes were seen in weight, waist circumference, diastolic blood pressure, and the reduction in risk of diabetes was 67.4 % ( P < 0.001 ).. The cohort study showed that a brief, small-group weight loss intervention was effective. However, it did not reach broadly into the population that was at risk for diabetes. The incidence of diabetes is a significant public health concern. With the completion of the Diabetes Prevention Programme, there has been a proliferation of studies attempting to understand the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness of lifestyle diabetes prevention interventions and compare effects by intervention delivery agent ( dietitian vs non-dietitian ) and channel ( in-person vs technology-delivered )."
27595415," BACKGROUND Low serum vitamin D levels are associated with asthma exacerbations, most often caused by respiratory tract infections.  We examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the incidence of asthma exacerbations... We sought to determine whether the immunologic and clinical effectiveness of calcitriol supplementation on asthma exacerbations in children and adults with mild to moderate asthma and vitamin D deficiency. METHODS We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing vitamin D3 ( 400 IU ) with placebo  in schoolchildren. The primary outcome was the proportion of children that were r and omized to receive oral vitamin D ( 1000 IU ) or placebo in a clinical trial.. The secondary outcomes included the percentage of children with asthma exacerbation, the total number of exacerbations, and the mean time to asthma exacerbation.. Children from the placebo arms in these trials were treated with immunotherapy only and were included in the present analysis. RESULTS Treatment with vitamin D did not significantly affect sputum neutrophils or eosinophils compared with treatment with placebo. The reduction in asthma exacerbation  was significant ( P < 0.05 ). The mean times to exacerbation  and to systemic corticosteroids  were not different between the 2 groups.. Serum vitamin D content was lower in children than in adults.. A prespecified subgroup analysis was done to assess whether effects of the intervention on  the co primary outcomes were modified by the baseline vitamin D status. This trial is registered with Clinical Trials.gov, number NCT00977873. The study showed that vitamin D treatment to prevent  asthma exacerbations  and improve  asthma control ( P = 0.016 ).

The study aim ed to determine the prevalence and two-year incidence, as well as the course, frequency, and intensity of pain in the neck, mid back, and low back ( spinal pain ). Methods This study was a school-based prospect i ve cohort study. All 5th and 6th grade students ( 11–13 years ) at 14 schools in  the Region of Southern Denmark were invited to participate ( N = 1,348 ). Data were collected in 2010 and again two years later, using an e-survey completed during school time. The lifetime prevalence of lumbar pain was 86 % and 89 % at baseline and follow-up, respectively. The construct, convergent validity was good ( r = 0.83 ). The internal consistency reliability estimate was high ( Cronbach's α = 0,90 ). Factor analysis demonstrated a single-factor structure with an explained variance of 52.22 %. The test-retest reliability was excellent, indicated by an ICC(agreement ) of 0.97, and the agreement observed in this Bl and and Altman plot demonstrated no systematic bias. It is concluded that the PFRI has excellent psychometric properties for assessing athletes with LBP. Progression of pain from one to more locations and from infrequent to  more frequent was common over the two year period. Conclusions Spinal pain is common at the age of 11–15 years, but some have more pain than others. The pain is likely to progress, i.e., to a more locations, higher frequency. and higher pain intensity over a two year period. The FRI was built to assess physical functioning in patients with SP.

23506544," Background Physical activity is an independent risk factor for diabetes and heart disease. The evidence that increasing physical activity can reduce the risk of developing these chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a one year low-intensity computer-tailored physical activity programme among older adults with impaired glucose tolerance. Methods : Prospect i ve cohort study of 5395 adults ( 199,265 men and 216,910 women ) were recruited to the study. The control group received general dietary and exercise advice at baseline and had an annual physician's examination. The subjects in the intervention group received additional individualized dietary counseling from a nutritionist. The participants were then enrolled through these general practice s using an invitational letter. The intervention was the most intensive during the first year, followed by a follow-up visits. A significant effect of the programme was only observed on waist circumference ( -1.56 cm ( 95%CI : -2.91 to -0.21 ) ). The study showed significantly greater improvement in each intervention goal. After 1 and 3 years, weight reductions were observed in those who exercised for an average of 92 min per week ( 95 % CI 71 - 112 ) or 15 min a day ( SD 1·8 ), respectively. The first two groups either received four letters or took part in four interviews, whereas the combined group received two letters and two interviews in turns at 5, 13, 30 and 43 weeks.

24879789," BACKGROUND For patients who have a ventricular tachycardia ( VT ), implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) are a mainstay of therapy to prevent sudden death. However, ICD shocks are painful, can result in clinical depression, and do not offer complete protection against death from arrhythmia. We hypothesized that elimination of local abnormal ventricular activities ( LAVAs ) during sinus rhythm or ventricular pacing would be a useful and effective end point for substrate-based VT ablation. As an adjunct to this strategy, we used a new high-density mapping catheter and frequently used epicardial mapping. The patients did not receive  antiarrhythmic drugs.  Patients were prospect ively enrolled and the site of origin was localized by a combination of techniques, including pace mapping, activation-sequence mapping, recordings of middiastolic potentials, and application of re setting and entrainment principles. RF current at 55 V was applied ( 3.8 + /- 3.1 applications per patient ).. The primary end point was survival free from any clinical VT(s ) by programmed electrical stimulation was prevented in 85 % of patients ( 89 % ). ES was acutely suppressed in all patients ; a minimum period of 7 days with stable rhythm was required before hospital discharge. At a median follow-up of 22 months ( range, 1 to 43 months ), 87 patients ( 92 % ) were free of VT. In patients without documented VT, the predictive value of noninducibility of VT with more than 3 ventricular extrastimuli limits the specificity of the test. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that, from a societal perspective, catheter ablation appears to be a cost-effective alternative to amiodarone for treating VT... transcatheter catheter ablation is a widely used therapeutic option for patients with VT.-.)..."
22513945," Background —The pulmonary vein ( PV ) ) and atrial fibrillation ( AF ) frequently coexist in the same patient. We hypothesized that adding ablation of large areas around both pulmonary veins ( PVs ) is a potential complication. We assessed whether a modified CPVA approach including additional ablation lines on posterior wall and the mitral isthmus would reduce the incidence of AF. Methods and Results — A total of 149 patients with AF were followed up with 7-day Holter monitoring at 3, 6, and 12 months after CPVA. The isolation of each individual PV was an electrophysiologically guided, ostial segmental ablation with a 64-pole basket catheter or a 20-pole circular mapping catheter ( group I ). The primary end point was freedom from AF after the procedure. In group 1, 28 patients ( 10 % ) experienced new-onset AF ( mean duration of follow-up 29.4 months ), with the number of PVs requiring isolation before termination increasing with AF duration ( P = 0.018 ). Patients underwent a three-dimensional mapping system ( EnSite NavX, St Jude Medical, St Paul, MN, USA ). At 9 months, 7 of 8 patients ( 64 % ) were free from AF. The majority of patients ( 84 % ) had no recurrence of AF, and only 3 patients ( 14 % ) after ablation therapy ( p = NS ).. The increase in AFCL ( 30±17 versus 14±11 ms ), and focal AT was found in 5 ( 18 % ). In the group 2, gap-related macroreentrant AF, the rate of recurrence was significantly higher and catheter ablation ( P<0.01 ). There were no thromboembolic events in patients who underwent catheter ablation. The secondary objective of this review was to assess the beneficial and harmful effects of  catheter ablation, which was compared with medical treatment in patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF."

Testicular volume and pampiniform vein diameter were measured, and Doppler ultrasound was performed. RESULTS After 12 months volume of the involved left testis increased to almost normal in treated boys ( mean atrophy index 12.7 % at surgery and 3 % 12 months later ). In controls the corresponding atrophy indexes were similar. In both groups, the operations were performed by Palomo's technique with preservation of lymphatics and meatus.. The mean sperm concentration per mL, sperm motility, volume, vitality, and rate of morphologically normal sperm for the group with arteries preserved and "" normal "" spermiograms ( P <.01 ). CONCLUSIONS Varicocele treatment in adolescents with moderate and severe varicocele reversed testicular growth arrest and result ed in catch-up growth within 12 month of surgery.. At a mean follow-up of 14 months, we believe that surgical treatment of varicoceles is as high as 15 % in children and adolescents. Optimal management of varicocele was not been consoli date d. None patient from the LS group developed a hydrocele. CONCLUSIONS The microsurgical subinguinal and high inguinal approaches seem to yield similar success rates in terms of tissue preservation. The clinical efficacy of LV is superior to traditional OV...A varicocele. The incidence of varicocele is higher than the control group."
28229164," Background : Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in women. We studied the relationship between the incidence of AF, the risk factors for AF, and the impact of these endpoints in patients with psoriasis. We aimed to prospect the associations of body size, weight change, and level of PA in a large population -based cohort. Methods and Results : We prospect ively followed up 34 759 women who attended baseline visits in 1991–1996 of the Malmö Diet and Cancer study. We used hospital diagnosis data from the Danish National Hospital Discharge Register to determine the rate of first AF. During the follow-up period, total AF was ascertained from annual ECG records, and atrial fibrillation. A multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between obesity and type of AF. The adjusted hazard ratios ( HRs ) of AF incidence were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models, taking into account conventional risk factors. The rate of hospital admissions for AF.. In the MESA cohort, 47.2 % was male ; at baseline, 25.7 % had hypertension ; 12.5 % had diabetes. Compared with the systolic BP ( SBP ) < 120 mm Hg and normal-weight,  the adjusted HRs ( 95 % CI ] of AF were increased by 37 %, 129 %, and 156 % ( Pinteraction=0.04 ). The strongest risk factors were observed for hypertension ( hazard ratio ( HR ), followed by obesity ( HR = 1.26 to 2.00, P trend 0.02 ). Higher  levels of physical activity reduced the AF risk among participants under age 65 years. The PAF for smoking was 1.16 ( 1.06 - 1.27 ), and 1.44 ( 0.73 -.A+). and- ."
26806817," OBJECTIVES To develop and vali date a new risk-of-bias tool for nonr and omized studies ( NRSs ). Study goals were : to determine the feasibility of implementing a RY intervention for women with fibromyalgia. The primary aims of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of the yoga and meditation as a therapy for fibromyalgia sufferers, and to test the intervention ’s effects at 3-month follow-up in the immediate treatment group. RESULTS Findings provide evidence of association between participating in gentle Hatha yoga classes and reduced fibromyalgia - related symptoms. Significant improvements were also seen in  the reported number of days "" felt good "" and number of nights "" missed work "" because of fibromyalgia. CONCLUSIONS RoBANS contains six domains : the selection of participants, confounding variables, the measurement of exposure, and finally the reporting of outcomes. The yoga group participated in twice-weekly yoga sessions for 12 weeks. The study results showed that the majority of participants preferred yoga, and at 6 and 12 weeks to explore their use as st and ard therapies. The participants extended 11 items from the CONSORT Statement, added 1 item, and developed a modified flow diagram. The authors' findings suggest that yoga may improve aspects of QOL and tools for systematic review. The Delphi survey 33 key component recommendations of yoga interventions for musculoskeletal conditions were not correlated with the overall risk of bias in these studies."
31722229," The effect of a single oral dose of caffeine was examined in a r and omised double-blind placebo-controlled repeated- measures cross-over study. Eighteen children with AD/HD, aged between 8 and 13 years, were individually age- and gender-matched with a control group. All children participated in two sessions, one week apart. Skin conductance level ( SCL ) from a 3 min eyes-closed epoch, commencing 30 min after ingestion of caffeine or placebo. Eyes-closed resting electroencephalogram ( EEG ) and autonomic data ( SCL, heart rate, respiration rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure ) during 2 min epochs that commenced every 4 min after administration. The ADHD group performed the task off and on their usual dose of MPH.. Caffeine was associated with increased SCL, increased respiratory rate and a global reduction in alpha power. There were no significant cardiovascular effects of caffeine-induced arousal. These caffeine results are consistent with our recent electrodermal and EEG studies of arousal, and confirm the potential use of caffeine as a simple means of experimentally modifying arousal levels without task-related confounds. CONCLUSIONS The positive results are significant in ADHD, these findings usually emerged from indirect behavioural measures which give only a limited underst and ing of arousal dysregulation in this condition. Although the mean skin conductance response to target stimuli was found not to differ between groups during the initial test phase but became significantly different in phase 2."
21276215," The aim of the present study was to compare the retention and caries-preventive effect of a glass ionomer cement ( GIC ) and a resin-based sealant on the occlusal surfaces of children and adolescents. The study tested the feasibility of using a glass-ionomer sealant when compared to a conventional fissure sealant. After three years, the study was conducted in the two groups. The children aged 8 - 13 years old with the sealants were included. Two permanent first molars on one side were sealed with GIC, and the rest were sealed by resin -based sealant. The same persons were invited to the follow-up 6.1 to 7.8 ( mean 7.1 ) years after the application of sealants.. Follow-up examinations for sealant retention were done at baseline, 1 day, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. The number of children available for reexamination was 0 ( after 6 months ) ; 121 ( after 1 year ) ; 115 ( after 2 years ). The authors conducted a systematic review evidence from the English literature as to whether caries occurrence on pits and fissures of teeth sealed with either GIC or resin was the same. The revised systematic review evidenced that the caries incidence in GIC group compared with control group was 0.17 surfaces applied by the authors. The difference in caries occurrence between the 2 groups was significant.. The review evidence is the following:  the incidence of caries occurrence is 0.66 ( 95 % CI 0.14 - 1.30 ).. We also sought to identify the root caries occurrence and type of caries occurring..

29594349," OBJECTIVE This longitudinal r and omized controlled clinical trial evaluated the clinical performance of two techniques and material s for restoring posterior cavities in single- or multi-surface cavities and provides a survey of the 3-year results. MATERIAL S AND METHODS Three clinicians placed 46 Quixfil ( Xeno III ) and 50 Tetric Ceram ( Syntac Classic ) composite restorations in Class II cavities of posterior teeth. In all cavities, a one-step self-etching adhesive ( XenoV+ ) was applied. Class II restorations were followed up by way of a structured phone call at day 2 and day 7 post-operatively. The restorations were evaluated in accordance with the modified United States Public Health Service criteria. The restoration was evaluated with slightly modified USPHS criteria at baseline and then annually during 6 years. RESULTS A total of 97.8 % of QuiXfil and 100 % of TetricCeram posterior restorations were assessed to be clinical ly excellent or acceptable with predominating alfa scores. Up to the 4-year recall, four Quixfilm restorations failed because of bulk fracture, and two Filtek Z250 restorations. At the end of 2 years in both groups, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of sensitivity ( P > 0.05 ). The comparison of restoration performance with time within both groups yielded a significant increase in marginal discoloration ( P =.003 ) and deterioration of marginal integrity ( p = 0.029 ) for the resin composite. The type of dentine-bonding agents could also be responsible for postoperative sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS The overall risk of immediate postoperative sensitivity was 20.3 % and was not affected by either the adhesive strategy ( etch- and -rinse/self-etch ) or the filling technique ( incremental/ bulk ). The research question was “ Do bulk-fill resin composites have a clinical performance comparable to conventional resin composites used for direct restorations of posterior dentitions? ”."

This study assessed whether adjunctive maintenance treatment with risperidone long- acting therapy ( RLAT ), added to treatment-as-usual ( TAU ). Clinical and sociodemographic features associated with missing at least 25 % of doses of at least 1 medication were assessed using logistic regression, and a risk stratification model was developed and vali date d. RESULTS Of 3,640 subjects with acute exacerbation of bipolar disorder, 871 ( 24 % ) reported nonadherence. The primary end point was time from r and omization to recurrence of any mood episode. Other end points included proportion of patients with recurrence of mood episode and recurrence by mood episode type. R and omized patients were compared to placebo, 5 to 20 mg/d ( n = 370 ) ; or olanzapine-fluoxetine combination, 6 and 25... The rate of mildly and poorly compliant patients was close to 40 %.. An independent clinician board declared any clinical events that occurred but the treatment assignment was concealed. RESULTS During all 8 study weeks, the olinzapine and olecranon group had significantly fewer patients ( P <.0001 ). The RLAI patients received the following bi-weekly dosages : 25 mg ( N = 9 ), 37.5 mg ( n= 8), and 50 mg ( P =.001 ). Patients were not depressed at study entry. The two groups did not differ on baseline WHOQOL-BREF scores in any domain, but at the 1-year follow-up, AM fared better on all domains. CONCLUSIONS Paliperidone and the other LAIs that were used to overcome non-compliance in bipolar I disorder ( MAD ) and /or Schizoaffective Disorder ( SAD )."
23737033," Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of two vaginal estrogens ( HT ) on the incidence and severity of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. The primary aim of this double-blind, randomized controlled trial was to compare the effects of oral ultra-low dose combined hormone replacement therapy ( CEE ) with placebo. Methods Healthy, non-smoking postmenopausal women were r and omized 1:1:1 to receive treatment with either oral estrogen ( E2 ) or placebo. Women in the treatment group received intravaginal estriol 0.625 mg plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg/day, or a placebo for 6 months. After three months of treatment, 20 % of placebo-treated patients and 80 % of the CEE group were treated for 24 weeks with placebo, then with the same regimen. The four co primary endpoints were the percentage of women with vaginal dryness, urethral cytologic findings, the vaginal pH, and urethrocystometry.

12917933," OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy and safety of oral atenolol compared with placebo in the management of mild and moderate pregnancy hypertension. RESULTS Prospect i ve study of 120 women with mild to moderate pregnancy-associated hypertension.. The mothers were randomized to receive either atenolol ( n = 39 ) or placebo. The clinical interpretation of antenatal and intrapartum cardiotocographs was uninfluenced by atenolol.  Maternal blood pressure decreased significantly after treatment, but this was not an indicator of subsequent fetal growth.. Other obstetric indices, such as urinary estriol excretion, were the same in both groups. The incidence of maternal hypertension was similar in two groups ( mean SBP was 133.6, 130 and 134 mmHg, respectively ). The outcome for the newborns were similar in group A and lower in groups B and C, as is to be expected with beta-blocker treatment. The 63 women had a high incidence of diabetes mellitus diagnosed during pregnancy, and by 7.8 ( -11.4 to -4.2 ) mm Hg. The following haemostatic parameters were determined : thrombelastography, fibrinogen, antithrombin III ( ATIII ), thrombin-antithrombo (TAT)-complex, and that of neonate. There were no stillbirths, but one neonatal death in this group. CONCLUSION To assess whether oral beta-blockers are better than placebo, or other antihypertensives, for pregnancy hypertension, and whether they are better for mother and baby."
31860749," Background : It is the first study to investigate the efficacy of intravenous iron in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) and iron deficiency. This trial aim ed to assess the effect of oral iron on the severity of anemia. Methods and results The trial was a prospect i ve, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 60 non-anaemic patients with CHF. An intravenous iron supplement of 100 mg/week was administered as an infusion in 100 ml of normal saline. The patients were enrolled in a r and omized. Iron deficiency was assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was incidence of ABT. Secondary endpoints were various hemoglobin ( Hb ) levels, change in Hb between time points, length of stay, iron status, morbidity, mortality, and quality of life 4 weeks postsurgery. Results : A 60 % reduction in ABT was observed in the IV iron group compared with the usual care group ( P = 0.002 ). Baseline mean Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) score was 54.3 ± 16.4 and KCCQ overall summary score was 52.4 ± 18.8. Ferric carboxymaltose significantly improved VAS and Hb levels at Weeks 6, 12, 24, 36, and 52. In the second protocol, patients underwent staged isovolemic venesection of 2 L of blood. At Week 24, significant improvement vs. placebo was achieved in all the five EQ-5D dimensions. Mean platelet counts dropped on FCM but not on placebo.. Oral iron preparations have a high incidence of side effects, the majority of patients had a low incidence of adverse effects, and are increasingly used in treating anemia.. The newer, more stable iron preparations in particular purport to have a lower incidence of undesirable side effects. The intravenous iron preparations can be administered to patients with no clinical iron deficiency, and has a number of physiological manifestations. Early, or non-anemic iron deficiency can result in fatigue and diminished exercise capacity. and. )... Intravenous iron preparations are efficacious in preventing anemia, and the incidence of severe anemia."

31007780," BACKGROUND To determine whether or not radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) for persistent atrial fibrillation ( AF ) in patients with heart failure ( HF ). Existing r and omized studies of AF and LVSD of varying etiologies have reported modest benefits with a rhythm control strategy.. Catheter ablation is a common condition in heart failure with the potential to impact hemodynamics and progression of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. This study was design ed to evaluate the effects of an irregular RR interval, independent of the average ventricular rate, on cardiac hemodynamic data during AF. METHODS Sixteen patients with AF were studied invasively. During intrinsically conducted AF ( mean rate 102 + /- 22 beats/ min ), the right ventricular apex electrogram was recorded onto frequency-modulated ( FM ) tape. After optimization of rate control, patients were monitored for both symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes of AF. The increase in cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR ) LVEF in the RFA group was 4.5±11.1 % compared with 2.8±6.7 % in  the rate control group ( p=0.015 ). The RFA group had a greater increase in radionuclide LPEF ( a prespecified secondary end point ) than patients with AV-node ablation with biventricular pacing. The primary endpoint, peak oxygen consumption.. The time to the first documented atrial tachyarrhythmia of more than 30 seconds ( - 3.07 ml/kg/min, 95 % confidence interval : 0.56 to 5.59, p = 0.018 ). In the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, 88 % of patients receiving catheter ablation ( CA ) of AF compared with 4.4 ± 13 % of those not receiving such drugs were free of cardiac tamponade, whereas age, gender, body mass index, international normalized ratio, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cardiac resynchronization therapy. CONCLUSIONS An irregular sequence of RR intervals produces adverse hemodynamic consequences that are independent of heart rate. and.  .. Our primary aim was to compare patient-centered outcomes and surrogate outcomes following catheter ablation with or without catheter ablation in HFrEF."
27820712," BACKGROUND To assess the cost effectiveness of ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) in general practitioners. The Multicentre Aneurysm Screening Study was design ed to assess whether or not such screening is beneficial. All patients who attended were individually allocated to screening in the four trials, and data were collected and analysed from 46 397 aortic scans for men aged between 64 and 83 years who attended one of the three screening programmes.  Comparisons were made for age st and ardised population s ( 65–74 years ). The incidence of AAA, based on costs applied to the events experienced by the men, was estimated at $ 19500 ( CI, $ 12400 to $ 39800 ) per life-year gained. Conclusion Of 1437 examinations there were 73 AAAs of 3.0 cm diameter or larger ( 5.1 % ).. Mortality data were obtained from the Office of National Statistics, and an intention-to-treat analysis was based on cause of death. The primary outcome measure was mortality. The prevalence of AAA in central Denmark would appear to be significantly different from that in southern Engl and and Western Australia. A few observational studies of programs under way in localized areas have established the feasibility of systematic screening and have explored its practical implementation. There were 65 aneurysm-related deaths ( absolute risk 0.19 % ) in those screened compared to control group ( risk reduction 42 %, 95 % CI 22 - 58 ). There was no significant difference between intervention and control faculty, but the compliance rate for control faculty was significantly higher than the rate for study residents for all reminders together and separately for FOBT but not mammography or Pap testing. The intervention ’s effect was greatest for patients with AAA."
24847960," BACKGROUND A role for vitamin D deficiency in Parkinson disease ( PD ) has recently been proposed. OBJECTIVE To compare the prevalence of vitamin D status in a research data base cohort of patients with PD with theprevalence in age-matched healthy controls and patients with Alzheimer disease ( AD ). DESIGN Survey study and blinded comparison of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25[OH]D ) concentrations of stored sample s in a clinical research database at Emory University School of Medicine. SETTING Referral center ( PD and AD patients ), primary care clinics, and community setting ( controls ). PARTICIPANTS Participants were recruited into the study between May 1992 and March 2007. Every fifth consecutively enrolled PD patient was selected from the clinical research  base. Unrelated AD ( n = 97 ) and control ( n= 99 ) participants were r and omly selected from The data base after matching for age, sex, race, APOE genotype, and geographic location. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prevalence of suboptimal vitamin D and mean 25(OH)D concentrations. RESULTS Significantly more patients with Parkinson ( 55 % ) had insufficient vitamin D than did controls ( 36 % ) or patients with AD ( 41 % ; P =.02, chi(2)test ). The mean ( SD ) 25(Hyd)D concentration in the PD cohort was significantly lower than in  the AD and control cohorts ( 31.9 [ 13.6 ] ng/mL vs 34.8 [ 15.4 ] ng /mL and 37.0 [ 14.5 ] ng./mL, respectively ; P <.03 ). CONCLUSIONS This report of 25(hyd)D values in a predominantly white PD cohort demonstrates a significantly higher prevalence of hypovitaminosis in PD vs both healthy controls or patients of AD. These data support a possible role of vitamin K deficiency in pathogenesis and clinical course of PD. The treatment with MK-4 can increase the BMD of vitamin d- and K-deficient bone by increasing vitamin K concentration, and it can also decrease calcium levels through inhibition of bone resorption, result ing in an increase in 1,25-(OH)(2)D."
18348591," BACKGROUND To determine whether a 12-month program of regular exercise can improve balance, reaction time, neuromuscular control, and muscle strength and reduce the rate of falls in older adults.. A repeated- measures experimental research design was employed as a sample of 55 apparently healthy, older, community-dwelling volunteers ( 30 exercisers- 25 women and 5 men ; 25 comparisons- 16 women and 9 men ) were evaluated for the incidence of falls, and the change in strength. Results : There were 10 falls on carpet, and only a single fall on vinyl floor covering ( relative risk 8.3, 95 % confidence interval 0.95–73, p = 0.05 ). There were four falls in those receiving  additional exercise , and seven falls in participants receiving only conventional physiotherapy. The effect was mainly the result of participants with low initial strength. The overall testing, exercisers and controls performed similarly in all tests and were well matched in relevant health and lifestyle factors. The mean number of classes attended by the 75 exercise subjects who completed the program was 60.0 ( range 26 - 82 ). At the end of the trial, the exercise subjects showed improved performance in all five strength measures, but the balance, there were no significant effect of PRT on balance.. The serious health, social and economic consequences of falls are well documented. Lower extremity muscle weakness and power as well as balance impairment are major independent intrinsic contributors to falls and amenable to intervention.. Therefore, our objective was to systematic ally review the literature to probe the merit of exercise training as a single intervention on balance  and related factors. Progressive resistance training ( PRT ) is widely accepted as an appropriate modality for treating sarcopenia and has been reported to improve balance."
21810228," BACKGROUND Major depression has far-reaching consequences for work functioning and absenteeism. In most cases depression is treated by medication and clinical management. The addition of occupational therapy ( OT ) might improve outcome. We determined the cost-effectiveness of the addition of OT to treatment as usual ( TAU ). METHOD Sixty-two adults aged 18 - 65 years when first treated for breast cancer ( identified through the Quebec Tumor Registry ) and a r and omized sample of frequency-matched women living in Quebec ( identified from provincial health care files ) who had never been diagnosed with cancer. RESULTS : A multidisciplinary team decides if return to original or modified work is possible or if vocational rehabilitation is necessary. This model has been implemented by the investigators in the Sherbrooke ( Quebec, Canada ) area. We conducted the follow-up of patients with low back pain. After rehabilitation, the occupational future still was uncertain in 13.2 % of those who were still out of work. In the control group... The rate was 79 % and the mean sick leave was 16.4 + /- 22.0 days ( median 7 ). The mean number of sick-leave days was similar between the two groups.  Ergonomic and clinical interventions  have been implemented as planned.. : To implement the program at a provincial level, a network for management, research and education in work rehabilitation was developed.. An external assessment is presently planned to evaluate recovery to work and economic outcomes and quality of life.. Linking these two strategies in a same multidimensional team represents a systemic approach to address this multifactorial ailment. During the first year of this trial we did not find any evidence that women diagnosed with breast cancer experience discrimination at work."

This study evaluated the effects of an early behavioral intervention ( EBI ) with nonstructured st and ard physical care ( routine care intervention [ RCI ] ) in preventing weight gain in people with schizophrenia. The effects of the weight management program were also assessed with regard to safety and quality of life. This r and omized controlled trial investigated the impact of cognitive/behavioral interventions that promote motivation and provide strategies to overcome the barriers in adherence to diet and activity modification are effective interventions for weight loss. The study group was placed on a diet that reduced calorie intake by 200 to 300 kcal per day ( to 1,300 to1,500 kcal per year for women and to one,600 to 2,800 kcal per month for men ). The primary outcome measure was change in body weight. The participants were enrolled. The mean + /- SD weight loss at endpoint was significant in both groups ( p <.05 ) and numerically greater in patients receiving BT than in those receiving UC. In both groups, men gained significantly more weight than did women. A multi-causal model which includes a higher prevalence of risk factors has provided a valid explanation. In terms of prevention, two cognitive/behavioural trials showed significant treatment effect ( mean weight change ) at endpoint ( 26.5 % [ 9/34 ] and 10.8 % [ 4/37 ], respectively ; p =.082 ). A post hoc analysis of patients attending at least 1 BT session showed that significantly more patients in the control group than the treatment group had lost > or = 5 % of their body weight at endpoint. Obesity in particular has been associated with both the lifestyle habits and the side effects of antipsychotic medications. The present systematic review and meta- analysis aims at collecting and updating available evidence on the efficacy of non-pharmacological health promotion programmes for psychotic patients with schizophrenia in r and o.A)."
21203852," Purpose To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Question naire ( NEI-VFQ ), in regard to efficacy and tolerability in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Methods A prospect i ve clinical trial was conducted. The primary outcome measures were reduction in intraocular pressure ( IOP ) from baseline at 2 hours postdose, change in cardiac and respiratory function, quality of life, and patient satisfaction. Patients who received brimonidine as combination therapy ( n = 554 ) were examined in this study. The study was a 4-week, r and omized, open-label, two-period cross-over clinical trials.. The mean quality of vision score was 79 ± 15 ( range 45 - 100 ). The relationship between the outcome measures and the other ophthalmic solution was also assessed. The correlation between visual disability and both the visual field and visual acuity measurements collected. Of the factors examined, retinal sensitivity in the lower eye ( r = −0.497, p = 0.001 ) and  the average inter-item correlation. Overall, patient question naire scores were also assessed just after completing the instillation of each ophthalmic solution. Results : Mean IOP, just before the withdrawal of timolol ophthalmic solution, was 16.4 ± 2.9 mm Hg. At the end of Timoptol XE or Lizmon TG instillation, the mean additional IOP reduction was 15.5 % ( 3.61 mm Hg ), and 53 % were women. The baseline  IOP  was 25.3 + /- 5.3 mm Hg, and this was significantly correlated to the clinical outcomes.

28640907," BACKGROUND Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) may experience poor muscle health as a result of chronic hyperglycemia. Despite this, muscle function in children with this design to assist authors, editors, and readers. The authors developed and tested a checklist of criteria related to the internal and external validity of observational longitudinal studies. The checklist criteria concerned recruitment, data collection, biases, and data analysis and descriptive issues relevant to study rationale, study population, and generalizability. Two raters independently assessed 49 r and omly selected articles describing physical activity and changes in physical activity over time. RESULTS Mean hours of physical activity was measured during 7 consecutive days with a uniaxial accelerometer, and energy intake was assessed concurrently with a 7-day food diary... Physical activity was best modeled as a quadratic function of age, increasing until early adolescence and declining after age 13 in boys and girls. Multivariable modeling demonstrated that variables associated with physical activity level at baseline to determine the comparison of MVPA levels in asthmatics and controls was statistically significant ( P-value of likelihood ratio test [ LRT ] for effect modification by gender = 0.034 ). CONCLUSIONS Unlike boys, girls with active asthma appear to be less active than their healthy peers, and the protein and fibre intakes were higher in girls with diabetes. Further studies are needed to confirm the gender interaction in the childhood asthma-physical activity relation and  the potential for physical exercise prescriptions in children."
25994094," OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of a 2-year coaching program for healthy physical activity on perceived health status, body function, and activity limitation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS This follow-up study was a prospect i ve controlled trial comparing the effects of an Internet-based individualized training ( IT ) and a general training program ( GT ). In this prospect i n trial, a control group — which received a group-based patient education session led by a physical therapist, was compared to a treatment group which received the education session plus a control information leaflet at a ratio of 1:1. The primary outcome measure was patient's knowledge of CVD in RA ; secondary measures were psychological measures relating to effecting behaviour change, actual behaviour changes and clinical risk factors. All patients completed training diaries  ( evaluated bi-monthly ). At 24 months, the proportions of patients meeting public health recommendations for moderate intensity physical activity were significantly higher compared with baseline in both the IT and GT groups ( 19 and 24 %, respectively, P < 0.05 ). The adjusted relative risk of the intervention group was significantly higher than in the st and ard joint rehabilitation group at 1 month ( p = 0.022 ), 9 ( 40 % versus 14 % ), and 12 months ( 34 % versus 10 % ). There were no differences between the two groups concerning changes in depression, anxiety, fatigue and tension.. The study shows that there were no significant differences in physical activity as measured with an activity monitor, functional ability, depressive symptoms or fatigue. The behaviour change interventions used to improve physical activity behaviour in people who have RA, including the behaviour change techniques utilised using specific behavioural change taxonomy."
21109400," BACKGROUND : Neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is common and often refractory to treatment. We propose a method to present in a simple fashion the likelihood of response over a full range of response levels. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of oral nimodipine taken preoperatively and 6 hourly for 48 h postoperatively. We design ed this r and omized double-blind study to determine the analgesic efficacy and opioid-sparing effects of intravenous tramadol. The control group ( n = 20 ) received placebo capsules 1 h before the surgery.. The pain intensity was assessed by a 100-mm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) ranging from 0 ( no pain ) to 10 ( worst pain ever ). The patients were asked to receive either placebo or placebo. The study was designed to assess the  pain decrease considered as clinical ly relevant when design ing a trial and reporting its results. RESULTS : The visual analog scale scores for pain at rest and on coughing 24 and 48 h after thoracotomy were lower in the placebo group. The mean number of daily injections of the study medication were similar between the groups.. Visual analog scale pain scores ( 0–10 ) were recorded during the 24 h follow-up period, and patients received diclofenac, 75 mg IM, if their pain score was > 4. Pain was also assessed at two and six weeks after surgery. We conclude that adding clonidine 2 & mgr;g/mL to a ropivacaine interscalene perineural infusion does not decrease pain intensity at twenty-four hours, but the pain decrease was significantly greater in group than in group... Although not statistically significant, the  pain decrease seen with the use of placebo was significant...A ). and.."
18493163," The aim of this study was to study the marginal periimplant tissues at implant-supported orthodontic implants. The significance of the lacking periodontal ligament of implants was examined in the initial phase of healing. The study evaluated the clinical and radiographic manifestations of a rough/smooth implant border in 1-piece implants and on the location of an interface ( microgap ) between the implant and abutment/restoration in 2-piece configurations. The purpose of these patients were to examine histometrically crestal bone changes around unloaded non-submerged and submerged titanium implants. A period of healing was initiated. In one quadrant, the implants were covered by the flap. In the other quadrant, we treated with the same implant system. The implant was placed in edentulous m and ibular areas of 5 foxhounds. The healing period was evaluated. The mean bone level was found to be below the bone level. The periimplant conditions were very healthy after 5 years. The stage II to prosthesis delivery mean vertical bone loss ranged from 0.12 mm to 0.20 mm.. During the first year of function, significantly more complications/repairs were registered than the 2-stage systems. The concept of biologic width forms a basis for successful peri-implant soft tissue integration around tapered implant. The majority of implant sites were healed. The period of implant healing was 1.06+/-0.19 months. The biologic width and the mean implant depth were similar. The marginal bone level around implants was limited to implants and ankylosed teeth. The overall study showed that the biologic width was around 4 to 4.5 mm. The mechanical width of implants with a single-stage implant was not significantly different from the control andA+/.} -). .) field"
22947230," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the long-term outcomes of children with ADHD, the effects of medication management ( MedMgt ) and behavior modification therapy ( Beh ) and their combination ( Comb ) and usual community comparison ( CC ) in the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) differed at the 14-month assessment and to test whether these outcomes were predicted by the r and omly assigned treatments and subsequent self-selected prescribed medications. METHOD Most MTA children were 11 to 13 years old, representing 88 % of a cohort systematic ally diagnosed as hyperactive in childhood, and 95 ( 95 % ) of comparison cases of similar age. The greatest degree of agreement between raters at adolescence was between parent and youth ratings. These results are consistent with previous research demonstrating more severe ADHD, psychosocial adversity, and comorbidity with conduct, mood, and anxiety disorders. CONCLUSIONS The findings prospect ively confirm that the majority of ADHD LTOs may reflect a rise in global interest and recognition of consequences and impairment associated with ADHD. Although many world regions have published on ADHD.. The majority of studies have shown that ADHD is characterized by age-inappropriate levels of inattentiveness/disorganization, hyperactivity/impulsiveness, or a combination thereof. Although the criteria for ADHD are well defined, there were significant additional benefits of ADHD, namely antisocial and drug abuse disorders. In the adolescent outcome of this cohort, we found that most of these disturbances were dependent on the continuation of ADHD symptoms. In contrast, in adulthood, antisocial and/or drug disorders appeared, in part, independent of ADHD. The benefits of treatment in adults and children need to be more comprehensively understood and quantified."
30022830," OBJECTIVE Risperidone is effective for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) and noncompliance in children with autism and other pervasive developmental disorders ( PDD ). The authors report on whether risperidone may be safe and effective in reducing the core symptoms of autism, social and communication impairment and repetitive and stereotyped behavior. METHOD The data base from an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial ( N=101 ) and 16-week open-label continuation study ( n=63 ) of risperidone for children and adolescents with autism was used to test for drug effects on secondary outcome measures : scores on the Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Rating Scale, the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, and the Clinical Global Impressions. Results. Subjects who were taking risperidone ( mean dosage : 0.04 mg/kg/day ; 1.17 mg/day ) experienced a significantly greater mean decrease in the autism severity. The change in autism severity scores from baseline to 6-month follow up was significant in risperidone group ( P<.002 ). No decline in performance occurred with risperidone. Performance on a cancellation task ( number of correct detections ) and a verbal learning test ( word recognition ) was better on risperidone than on placebo. Conclusion The risperidone group showed a significant greater improvement on CGI scale, total score ( p =.006 ). There was no significant difference on RF-RLRS sensory motor and language subscale ( P =.34 ).. The mean score of risperidone was significantly greater than placebo.

26692005," BACKGROUND. Iron deficiency is a common complication of inflammatory bowel diseases ( IBD ). This r and omized, placebo-controlled study compared the efficacy and tolerability of single-dose intravenous ferric carboxymaltose ( FCM ), in comparison with oral ferrous sulfate ( FeSulf ) in patients with iron deficiency anemia. Subjects ( 559 ) with anemia, iron deficiency, and heavy uterine bleeding were assigned to receive either FCM ( 15 mg/kg, maximum 1000 mg ). On day 7, subjects received the other agent. Safety evaluations were performed on days 7 and 14. The primary endpoint was the incidence of treatment‐emergent adverse events during each 7‐day study period. During the first 24 hours and during the 7‑day treatment period, at least one treatment‑emergent adverse event was experienced by 15.0 % and 29.3 % of subjects after FCM and 11.4 % and 19.7 % after placebo. There were no serious adverse events. Primary end point was Hb response ( Hb increase ≥ 2 g/dL ), and secondary end points included anemia resolution and iron status normalization. Treatment-related adverse events occurred less frequently with the novel complex. The time to anemia recurrence was longer in the FCM group ( hazard ratio, 0.62, 95 % CI 1.05 - 2.70 ). The efficacy of this study was observed in 4 of 8 ( 50 %, iron group ) and 1 of 7 patients ( 14 %, placebo group, P = 0.005 ). There was no significant difference between FCM, the placebo, and other iron formulations. The study was conducted in a single infusions.

26717446," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of 1-year treatment with orlistat compared with placebo on the levels of adipocytokines, and insulin sensitivity in obese women with type 2 diabetic patients. The study was performed using the data base and stored serum sample s of female patients who had participated in an intervention study focused on weight loss. We evaluated the effect of the lipase inhibitor, orlistat, on these parameters. RESULTS The patients were enrolled in this study and r and omized to either a placebo or the intestinal lipase inhibitor orlistat.. The subjects received orlistat 120 mg three times a day plus L-carnitine 2 g one time a day or placebo. The intervention period lasted 6 months. Anthropometric parameters, such as Body Weight ( BW ), Body Mass Index ( BMI ), Waist Circumference ( WC ), and % Body fat ( BF ) were recorded. The BMI, there was a significant improvement of ADN and TNF-α, and a faster decrease of leptin and HS-CRP, the body-fat distribution ( PPG ), fasting plasma insulin ( FPI ), homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index ( HOMA-IR ), total cholesterol ( TC ), low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ), high-density lipoproteins ( HDL-C ), triglycerides ( Tg ), adiponectin, and sE-selectin. Conclusion : Orlistat was more effective than placebo in ameliorating insulin resistance, and anthropometric parameters. The mean percentage of body weight, HbA(1c ), FPG, PPG, and the insulin levels were similar in the two groups. The greatest improvements in insulin sensitivity, to the level of orlistat in modulating plasma levels of adipokines, ghrelin and C-reactive protein ( CRP )."
29776983," The ROBODOC system was design ed to address potential human errors in performing cementless total hip arthroplasty. The system consists of a preoperative planning computer workstation ( called ORTHODOC ) and a five-axis robotic arm with a high speed milling device as an end effector. We prospect ively followed 43 uncemented THAs for a minimum of 49 months ( mean, 64 months ; range, 49–85 months ).  Radiographs were assessed for femoral offset, acetabular inclination, and traditional PE. The patients were assessed clinical ly and radiographically at 8 weeks, 5 months, 12 months, and 24 months. Results : Robotic milling group had a significantly longer operation time, requiring on average 8.9 min for registration and 11.2 min for milling. At 5 years followup, the surgical time and blood loss were greater in the robotic-assisted group. In addition, the mean wear was 0.12 mm/year ( ± 0.01 mg/year ) compared with 0.18 mm/week ( ±0.02 mm/ year ) in those with a reconstructed acetabular angle. The complications including stem loosening, infection, and femoral fracture were more significant 5 years postoperatively. The level of significance was set as p < 0.05. The following factors were more frequent in late infected hemiarthroplasties : female gender ; previous surgery ; obesity ( body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2 ) ; glucocorticoid and immunosuppressant treatments. This systematic review and meta- analysis compared the safety and efficacy of robotic and conventional THA. The safe zone ( inclination, 30 ° –50 ° ; anteversion, 5 ° –25 ° ) described by Lewinnek et al. and the modified safe zone, however, were unclear. The relative efficacy and safety of robotic versus conventional THAs, however, are unclear. The robotic assisted total knee arthroplasty ( THA ) allows for accurate preoperative planning and component positioning, potentially enhancing the recovery of the.A."
24123139," Objective : To develop a reliable and valid new rating scale for measuring the natural progression and efficacy of muscular dystrophy.. A protocol has been design ed which selects patients with muscle disease.. The protocol was established in a group of patients aged 6 - 60 years with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases.. We studied the effects of a highly sensitive search filter for finding studies on measurement properties of measurement instruments in PubMed and a more precise search filter that needs less abstract s to be screened, but at a higher risk of missing relevant studies. A systematic review to assess the content of the 19 activity rating scales that have been used for muscular disease. The present study included 22 patients aged 32–75 years and with a mean duration of disease of 5.2 ± 3.6 years. They were r and omized by a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design to monthly infusions of ¶2 g/kg bodyweight IVIG or to placebo for 6 months each, followed by the alternative treatment. The data were analyzed retrospectively for their predictive value as indicators of approaching ventilator dependency. RESULTS The seven patients who needed mechanical ventilation were the patients with DMD with the highest disability score ( Egen Klassifikation [ EK ] sum > 20 ) and the smallest values for FVC < 1.2 L ( FVC% < 30 ). We found a significant correlation ( p = 0.002 ) between FVC%, and both the total score and that which might have been expected in untreated patients. A mild and significant improvement ( 11 % ) in clinical symptoms was found using NSS, but not with other test procedures. The patients received 1 gm/kg/day for 2 consecutive days.

30338697," The use of patient-reported outcomes measurement information system ( PROMIS ) physical function item bank v1 ( PPFIB ) contains 124 item response theory ( IRT ) calibrated items. The data obtained utilizing this methodology may misrepresent the results and lead to spurious conclusions. This investigation compared preoperative AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot scores obtained before and after surgery from patients who had undergone elective surgery to determine if retrospectively acquired scores match those collected prospect ively. The scales were derived from the vali date d Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Assessment Question naire. Patients were asked to rate the importance of each symptom included in the severity score. The Pearson product moment correlation between first and second assessment was 0.937 for VAS, 0.963 for NRS and 0.901 for VRS. The correlation between the 2 threshold approaches to define individual-patient-level change : statistically reliable change and clinical ly important change. The results suggest that the NRS has the higher reliability in both groups of patients. A single physical function dimension accounts for most of the patient's postoperative outcome data. The goal of this systematic review is to determined the most commonly used outcome measurement tools used by foot and ankle specialists and determine their limitations, such as whether they are predictive of achieving full recovery or not. The symptom severity scale was four times as responsive, and the functional status and activities of daily living scales were twice as responsive. The reliable change index supported the conclusion that changes in FS scores of 7 or more units represented statistically reliable improvement.. The Quality of Life Rating Scale, SF-36, and SF-12 subscales were less sensitive to change.. Patients with preoperative physical function scores were predictive of postoperative improvement in physical function ( area under the curve [ AUC ] 0.83 ). The majority of studies were performed with the same tools."

Methods : A non-concurrent, randomized controlled trial. Children ( n = 105 ) were r and omly assigned to intervention with either Wii or control group. We investigated the effect of training with Nintendo Wii Fit games on the level of evidence and conduct of children with cerebral palsy. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a low-cost gaming system for children with developmental delay. RESULTS : Participants in the intervention group had a greater pre-post change on motor proficiency, visual-integrative abilities, and sensory integrative functioning.. The experimental group ( N = 10 ) who attended a segregated or integrated preschool participated to the study. All children's parents read and signed an informed consent form. The Wii game training group ( n=19 ) and the control group took part in their regular Jump Ahead programme. Pre- and post-intervention assessment s considered motor proficiency. The study showed that the experimental group improved significantly from pre to post intervention. The two groups were homogenous regarding all parameters, the child's perception of his/her motor ability and reported emotional well-being for many, but not all children."
22820555," OBJECTIVE We evaluated the effects of modafinil, a wake-promoting agent, on cognitive deficits and negative symptoms that are inadequately treated by antipsychotic medication. We have investigated the effect of enhancing serotonin function on fundamental brain processes that we have proposed are abnormal in these disorders. We performed a 12-week, r and omized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess modafinil on cognitive performance, and measures of sleep during simulated shift work. In all, 11 participants with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were r or omly assigned to receive either modafinil, placebo, or placebo for 8 weeks. The study ran from March 2002 through March 2006. Modafinil ( 200 mg ) and placebo were administered orally three times during the study, and cognitive performance.. The participants were assessed using the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Question naire ( FOSQ ) and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36 ). The results showed that modafinil improved the right BA47 responses to the No-go condition, but attenuated this response to aversive faces. Mod modafinil was also significantly more effective than placebo on the remaining two measures of cognitive function... Although modafinil is a central nervous system wake promoting agent used for the treatment of excessive daytime sleeping.. This study suggests modafinil may ameliorate the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly because of its beneficial effects on cognitive function, attentional set-shifting, and working memory.. We also performed a systematic review of modafinil in human cognition and emotion and whether these are consistently effective throughout the literature."

The aim of the present controlled r and omized trial was to determine whether probiotics in the prevention of neonatal infections in preterm infants. OBJECTIVE The authors examined whether the early administration of Lactobacillus GG, a mammalian milk glycoprotein involved in innate immune host defenses, can reduce the incidence of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis. METHODS In a prospect i ve controlled trial, 183 preterm infants < 30 weeks of gestation were enrolled to receive either daily probiotic supplementation ( 23–26 and 27–29 weeks ). The infants were divided into three groups : Group A and B received a dose of 1.6 x 10(7 ) cfu/g of dry milk. The control group received the same formula but without supplementation.  Intestinal permeability was measured within two days of birth and then seven and thirty days later using the lactulose/mannitol ratio. The incidence of NEC. The primary outcome was the occurrence of NEC, treatment with antibiotics, and the type of nutrition. There was a trend toward a lower rate of bacterial colonization of gut compared to those none colonized at day 7 ( 27.9 vs. 85.9 %, 0 vs. 7.8 % ) and at day 14 ( 2.4 % vs. 4.0 % ; P =.23 ).

17394228," OBJECTIVE This study compared the design and evaluation of an occupational therapy program developed at the National Institutes of Health for treating rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ). In the ideal case there is one single measure, reliably and validly assessed, which is acceptable as this criterion. The present study was conducted to demonstrate that a generic health status measure-the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP ), which were used as outcome measures in the r and omized research evaluation of the new program. The dependent variables measured were activity-of-daily-living status, psychosocial adjustment to illness, and daily activity log, were measured before and three months after intervention. The overall study showed good internal consistency ( alpha = 0.86 to 0.87 ). The question naire on performance in various roles in life was insensitive to change. In existing question naires, there was an attempt to represent the concept of QOL in terms of its most important aspects. The study showed that RA patients had higher scores on the NHP. The scale used to measure fatigue was not entirely suitable for application in clinical trials. The authors believe that the scale used in this study had an adequate sensitivity as it could distinguish placebo from the active treatments for all parameters evaluated. Neither of these properties is conducive to sensitivity to their validation."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a multidisciplinary intervention program on adiponectin and the anti-inflammatory responses of obese adolescents. Methods and Material s : 156 obese Chinese adolescents were enrolled and r and omly assigned to one of two isoenergetic breakfasts, either with egg or steamed bread.. The youths were rand omized to either control ( C ), moderate-intensity physical training or structured low-fat dietary intervention for 12 weeks. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES Twenty-one obese and age-matched lean adolescents ( age, 14 - 18 yr ; Tanner stage, > or = IV ) were studied cross-sectionally. The following were measured at pre- and postintervention : strength, dietary intake, body composition ( dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry/magnetic resonance imaging ) and glucose/insulin indexes ( oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ), and TNF-α. The concentrations of ghrelin, obestatin, and sOB-R were significantly lower in the obese children compared to the lean controls. At baseline, total fat mass rather than visceral adiposity was associated with higher leptin levels. Over the 8-mo intervention period, regardless of group membership, the balance between ghrelin and leptin ( P = 0.0004 ). Adiponectin concentration in IN was greater at 6 months ( 26 % ) and 12 months ( 8 % ) than CN. The peptide hormones leptin and ghrelin are involved in both, but the relationships between these peptides and obesity. The study provides evidence supporting the beneficial effects of whole-grain  intake on the metabolic outcomes in children, and that externally modifiable nutrition interventions for weight management in children are not seen in obesity."

The effect of the daily intake of inulin on fasting blood lipid, body weight ( BW ) and adiposity in overweight and obese volunteers. The objective was to evaluate the effects of a dietary portfolio administered at 2 levels of intensity on blood glucose, serum lipids, and serum acetate in healthy subjects. The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in which the subjects ( mean age 67.11 ± 6.11 ) were recruited from the Institute ’s pool of volunteers, no drop-outs. The trials include those that used primary and secondary intervention, diet and drugs, and control. The gut microbial composition in faeces was analysed by phylogenetic microarray and qPCR analysis of 16S rDNA. Plasma and urine metabolic profiles were analysed by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. RESULTS Treatment with inulin, but not the placebo, led to an increase in serum glucose ( P = 0.013 ), total and HDL cholesterol, free fatty acid, and insulin concentrations, and decreased the intestinal transit. In satiety group, these scores ( 20 min and 40 min ) were higher than control group. The results were in the same way with the 100 mm 5-point visual satiety scale. The overall attrition rate was not significantly different between treatments ( 18 % for intensive dietary portfolio, 23 % for routine dietary portfolio...

11687163," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of three or four-week inpatient physiotherapy and exercise courses in patients with ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ). We design ed an intervention package aim ed at promoting self-care and regular longterm exercise and evaluated its effect on outcome. METHODS Fifty-four patients with AS were r and omized for another 9 months to unsupervised daily exercises at home ( discontinuation group ) or a control group ( CG ). The individuals of the two groups were evaluated by the Swedish version of Stanford Health Assessment Question naire ( HAQ-S ), patient education booklet, and AS exercise reminder stickers. The outcome measures were function ( BASFI ), disease activity ( BASDAI ), global well being ( BAS-G ), and the score of AS. For group I patients an intensive exercise programme was organized under the supervision of a physiotherapist for six weeks. The total study period was 40 weeks. RESULTS Of the 200 patients, 155 completed the study ( 75 IG and 80 CG. ). The mean effects of group therapy and home exercises were respectively, 0.9 cm ( 16 % ) and 0.5 cm ( 9 % ) for BASFI, and BASDAI. These three differences were statistically significant. There were no significant differences in pain score, cervical rotation, or the self- assessment s of functioning. CONCLUSIONS Unsupervised recreational exercise was regarded to be an important part of treatment. The effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions was significant ( p < 0.01 for mobility, p = 0.05 for fitness and p <.01 for global health."
32307935," BACKGROUND : Most of the women who are on hormone replacement therapy discontinue medications due to vaginal dryness.. A rational formulation containing soy isoflavones ( 60 mg ), lactobacilli ( 500 millions spores ), calcium ( 141 mg ) and vitamin D3 ( 5 microg ) was added to the postmenopausal women. This study aim ed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D vaginal suppositories on maturation index, pH, and dryness in postmenopausal women. Material s and Methods : Women were enrolled in this double-blind clinical trial, in whom menopause occurred at least one year ago. Those women who had an abnormal Papanicolaou smear, had undergone hormonal treatment, or have had vaginal infection in the previous year were excluded. The incidence of total cancer ( excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers ), breast and colorectal cancers, hip and total fracture, and mortality was assessed by using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS In the WHI CaD, interactions between the use of either personal calcium or vitamin D supplements and CaD were found to reduce climacteric symptoms, reduce bone turnover and preserve BMD. In conclusion, osteoporosis prevention can actually be considered as a major additional benefit in menopausal women who use HRT for treatment of climacteric symptoms. The use of a st and ard dose of HRT for postmenopausal women was associated with a decreased risk of menopause-related symptoms, thereby restoring vaginal health. The association of mean Vitamin D levels in patients with urinary incontinence as compared to controls was significant with P = 0.0460. The mean pain level and changes of VMV correlated significantly at 6 months ( rho=0.361, P<0.01 ) and at 12 months ( p < 0.001 ). The objective of this systematic review, the first on this subject.

32152747," The purpose of this prospect i ve study was to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) with the conventional medial parapatellar approach in terms of postoperative knee scores and quadriceps strength. We investigated the objective results with a dynamometry in two groups ; one underwent the mini-subvastus approach and the other one a classical approach. The knees were also evaluated for range of motion, and patients, who were blinded as to the approach used, completed question naires at week 6, months 3 and 6. The knee scores improved similarly in both groups, but the mean extensor lag at 1 week and 1 month. The functional recovery in the MIS group was greater than the control group. The postoperative complications and total hospital stay were similar between the groups. The mean difference between groups for change in score from pre-operative to final follow-up in all three PROMs. The average time of the pivot shift, the Knee Society scores ( KSSs ), total and function scores, and visual analog scores for pain and activities of daily living.. The MIS technique results in a better immediate postoperative period, but no differences were seen in knee kinematics, gait speed, knee range of movement ( MKS ), and tibial plateau. The second group had no significant difference in postoperative knee pain. The best approach for the knee arthroplasty. The time taken to achieve straight leg raise post-operatively was significantly less than before the surgery. The optimal approach has been not fully clarified."
25031196," OBJECTIVE To investigate whether increased knee joint loading due to improved ambulatory function and walking speed following weight loss achieved over 16 weeks accelerates knee osteoarthritis. This study evaluated the relationship of medial knee load during walking to indices of structural disease progression, measured on MRI. METHODS Data from a prospect i ve study of weight loss in obese patients with knee OA ( the CARtilage in obese knee OsteoarThritis ( CAROT ) study ) were used to determine changes in knee joint compressive loadings ( model estimated ) during walking after a successful 16 week weight loss intervention. The participants were divided into'Unloaders'( participants that reduced joint loads ) and'Loaders... Risk of bias may vary across outcomes ( e.g., loss to follow-up may be far less for all-cause mortality than for quality of life ), and change scores were compared between high and low users of insoles using general linear models. Results Between group differences did not differ significantly for the primary outcomes of change in overall pain ( −0.3 points, 95 % confidence intervals −1.0 to 0.3 ) and change in medial tibial cartilage volume (. ).. In the overweight and the healthy weight groups, the peak KAM when walking in the modified shoe was significantly higher than that when walking barefoot ( P < 0.001 ). The groups showed similar significant changes in symptoms ( group difference : -2.4 KOOS points [ 95 % CI -6.8 to 1.9 ] ) and cartilage loss ( group differences : -0.06 BLOKS points. ). There was no significant difference between Loaders and Nonloaders. CONCLUSION We performed a systematic review, meta- analysis and assessed the evidence supporting a causal link between knee joint unloading during walking and structural knee OA."
29317216," OBJECTIVE To highlight emerging evidence for clinical and biological links between autism/pervasive developmental disorder ( PDD ) and schizophrenia, with particular attention to childhood-onset schizophrenia ( COS ). METHOD Clinical, demographic, and brain developmental data from the National Institute of Mental Health ( and other ) COS studies and selected family, imaging, and genetic data from studies of autism, PDD, and schizophrenia were review ed. RESULTS In the two large studies that have examined this systematic ally, COS is preceded by and comorbid with PDD in 30 % to 50 % of cases. Epidemiological and family studies find association between the disorders. Both disorders have evidence of accelerated trajectories of anatomic brain development at ages near disorder onset. A growing number of risk genes and /or rare small chromosomal variants ( microdeletions or duplications ) are shared by schizophrenia and autism. CONCLUSIONS Biological risk does not closely follow DSM phenotypes, and core neurobiological processes are likely common for subsets of these two heterogeneous clinical groups. Long-term prospect i ve follow-up of autistic population s and greater diagnostic distinction between schizophrenia spectrum and autism spectrum disorders in adult relatives are neededBACKGROUND: HighlightsMultisensory temporal acuity is impaired in schizophrenia but may be spared in ASD.Multisenory dysfunction is associated with incoherent perception and communicative deficit that characterize SSD and ASD. CONCLUSIONS These data indicate that the social deficits characteristic of autistic spectrum disorders are common. Given the continuous distribution of this traits, it may be arbitrary where cutoffs are made between research design ations of being "" affected "" vs "" unaffected "" with a pervasive developmental disorder. The genes influencing autistic tratraits appear to be the same for boys and girls."
30154381," OBJECTIVE To examine the cross-sectional associations among cardiorespiratory fitness ( 25(OH)D ) and type 2 diabetes... The aim of this study was to investigate whether vitamin D has an inhibitory effect on systemic inflammation.. : The study was conducted on school girls aged 11 - 15 years selected r and omly from various areas of Tehran, Iran.  Dietary information and amount of sunlight exposure were estimated by a 7 day recalling method using self-reported question naire.. Hypovitaminosis D defined as low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, serum insulin and HOMA-IR, bone mineral density, total fat mass, fat mass index ( FMI ), and other important covariates were included in the present study. The diet intervention was a group-based reduced-calorie program with a 10 % weight-loss goal. The exercise intervention consisted of 45 min of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic activity daily for 5 d/wk.. RESULTS : The mean daily vitamin D levels were significantly related to BMI, the waist circumference, and the insulinogenic index ( IGI ; calculated as change in insulin at 30 min/change in glucose at 60 min ). The study found that those with the lowest vitamin-D levels ( < 10 ng/ml ) had the highest insulin resistance ( HOMA2-IR : 2.04 ± 0.67 ). Conclusion : The deficiency of vitamin D was significantly lower in unfit than in fit women within each stratum of WC and waist/hip ratio, and within the normal weight BMI stratum. The incidence of diabetes mellitus was higher in women with vitamin D deficiency.. Studies have shown that vitamin D may play an important role in preventing the development of obesity. The current study was undertaken to quantitatively evaluate the association between vitamin D and obesity in both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects."
31582860," BACKGROUND Animal studies have suggested that conjugated linoleic acid ( CLA ) may reduce body fat mass ( BFM ) and increases or maintains lean body mass ( LBM ). However, the effects of CLA on body composition ( i.e., increase fat-free mass ( FFM ) ; decrease body fat ). The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of 3 g of a 1:1 mix of c9-t11 and t10-c12.. The subjects were divided into five groups receiving placebo ( 9 g olive oil ), 1.7, 3.4, 5.1 or 6.8 g/d, respectively... Subjects/ Methods : CLA ( 3 g daily ) plus n-3 LC-PUFA ( placebo ) or control oil ( 6 g /d ) was given to lean ( n=12 ; BMI 20–26 kg/m2 ) or the dairy product enriched with 3 g trans-10,cis-12 CLA ( n = 19 ).. Results : Body composition by the four-compartment model, resting metabolic rate ( RMR ), and serum lipid concentrations were significantly higher in the CLA group than after the control ( P = 0.013 ), whereas plasma F2-isoprostanes increased ( P<0.001 ). Plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations also were significantly ( P=0.05 ) compared with placebo.

21146772," BACKGROUND To evaluate the effectiveness of a classroom-based physical activity program on the effects of a school-based exercise intervention on improving physical activity levels  and on-task behavior during academic instruction. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact two different walking strategies had on step counts and reported sitting times. Participants : 515 children aged 9–11 years. Intervention : Action Schools! BC ( AS! BC ) was an active school model that provided schools with training and re sources to increase children ’s PA.. The primary outcome was the percentage of participants meeting PA recommendations. A total of 335 Mexican Ministry of Health office workers provided baseline data as a part of routine annual clinical screening examinations. Results Baseline mean body mass index and waist circumferences were significantly lower with supplementary breaks, and supplementary breaks attenuated accumulation of discomfort and eyestrain during work sessions. The intervention had a marginally significant effect on increasing the amount of physical activity, especially among children from Grade 6.. Children in the intervention group decreased their level of daily physical activity considerably, while activity levels in intervention children at baseline and after 6 months. The main outcome measure was change in BMI z-score. The relation between change in participants'satisfaction with current physical activity and increases in physical activity was mediated by increases in self-set goals. The results show a dose relation of increased physical activity with changes in goal setting, satisfaction, self-efficacy, commitment and intention... In the study, short activity bouts accumulated in short intervals ( e.g., < 10 minutes ) may be more feasible and appealing to the relatively sedentary populace than longer bouts."
25271203," Study Design. A cross-sectional study comparing a  back pain group with a pain‐free group. Objective. To compare the main effects and interactions of postural and cognitive difficulty on lumbar pain ( LBP ) and healthy subjects. Background Data. Little work has so far been conducted on the measurement of proprioception in the spine.. The measurement of postural responses following support surface translations is one way to examine motor control impairments in people with low back pain.  The upright st and ing posture was evaluated by means of two piezo-resistive electrogoniometers and a force platform for the conditions as follows : ( 1 ) quiet stance with and without vision, and ( 2 ) in anticipation of postural instability due to a ballistic arm movement or ankle muscle vibration. Results. No differences in body inclination were observed when visual information was available between the two groups ( P>0.05 ). The mean displacements of the center of pressure were greater for those with LBP, the mean displacement was greater than the control group. A measurement of left elbow position sense was conducted in five individuals from each group to establish differences in short‐term motor memory. The results suggest that young persons with recurrent LBP had a greater displacement of their COP that was associated with the postural instability. The adopted forward inclined posture was larger in magnitude ( P=0.03 ) and absolute error in peak angular position. Conclusion : Chronic LBP patients, when given a sufficient learning period, were able to reproduce trunk position with a spatial accuracy similar to control subjects. The study suggests that the dual-tasking did not change the proprioceptive function of lumbar position ( P = 0.007 ), which was noticed before and after the fatiguing procedure. CONCLUSIONS Our objective was to conduct a systematic literature review of methods used for assessment of proprioception of tunk in individuals with non-specific lumbar pain.A.)."
20482475," BACKGROUND Exercise training has now become established practice in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ). However, there is limited data regarding the effect of resistance training on the hemodynamic responses and peak oxygen consumption ( peak VO(2 ) ) of patients with CHF. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that exercise training applying the concept of comprehensive local muscle training can improve aerobic and functional capacity as well as quality of life in CHF patients. METHODS Twenty-four men and women with CHF were divided into either a RT program or non-training control group. Before and after 8 weeks of training patients underwent 2 identical exercise test sessions ( 15.2 + /- 0.9 vs. 18.0 +/- 1.1 min, P < 0. 001 ). Submaximal exercise heart rate was lower after training at 60 and 80 W ( 121 + / - 3 vs. 134 + - 5 beats/min, P = 0.01 ). The patients exercised for 1 h, three times per week for 8 weeks. Post training comparison, however, revealed that the EF and FS of the training group was significantly higher than in the control group ( VO2peak and peak workload, thigh muscle volume, and knee extensor endurance. In contrast, the mean energy expenditure values over the last year were lower ( 25 % vs. 46 %, P<0.001 ).. None of these changes in exercise capacity were significant... The exercise adherence decreased from a median of 95 minutes per week during months 4 through 6 of follow-up to 74 minutes per day during months 10 through 12. CONCLUSION Combined endurance/strength training was superior to endurance training alone in improving cardiac function, exercise capacity, peripheral muscle function, and QoL in people with chronic kidney failure.

To evaluate the effectiveness of two strategies to improve the use of active sick leave ( ASL ) for patients with low back pain. The purpose was to determine whether the rehabilitation program could reduce the incidence of back pain, time lost and cost due to the work-related disability. The study was a quasi-experimental longitudinal design. The patients who were recently on sick leave for the same duration were enrolled and omised to either grade d activity ( n = 55 ) or usual care. The intervention : Grade d activity, a physical exercise programme, and the patients return to work. The treatment group included the following: ( 2 ) a work-place visit ; ( 3 ) back school education ; and ( 4 ) an individual, submaximal, gradually increased exercise program. The outcome variables included pain, were less physically active, thought their complaints would worsen if they continued working, and reported fewer difficulties driving a car.. The outcomes showed that the intervention group had significantly fewer days of sick leave in the second half-year after the injury. The full intervention group returned to regular work 2.41 times faster than the usual care intervention group ( 3.4 % ). The rehabilitation group had a significantly less lost productivity, the workplace and incorporated the principals of the two interventions. The overall study suggests that rehabilitation interventions that include physical exercise, application of operant-conditioning behavioral principals, and promotion to reduce disability  remains elusive.

22437353," OBJECTIVE The efficacy of the Cox-Maze III procedure is effective for treating permanent atrial fibrillation ( AF ), its high complexity limits the use of this procedure in patients with mitral valve surgery. We hypothesized that MVS combined with LA cryoablation is superior to MVS alone. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-nine patients with permanent AF, included at four centres, underwent MVS with or without epicardial LA cryoablation. The primary endpoint was regained sinus rhythm. The control group consisted of 27 patients ( 6 men and 21 women ; age 64 + /- 7 years ) with documented AF. At 6 and 12 months follow-up, 73.3 % of patients who underwent cryoablation had regained sinuses rhythm at both follow-ups, compared with 45.7 and 42.9 % of controls ( P = 0.03 ). Restored biatrial contraction was present in 66.7 % ( 6 of 9 ) of patients in each group. The in-hospital complication rate was not different between the two groups. A fatal renal bleeding and mediastinitis occurred in 2 group A patients, 6 weeks postoperatively. The overall postoperative complications were similar in all three groups. The cardiopulmonary bypass time and the aortic cross-clamping time were shorter in the control group, but this factor bore no relation to increased morbidity after surgery. CONCLUSIONS The preliminary data from this first prospect to this consensus conference was to determine whether surgical atrial flutter ablation combined with atrial size reduction is a safe and highly efficient treatment in adult cardiac surgery alone in adults undergoing cardiac surgery for valve or coronary artery bypass grafting."
29309554," Background —Current methods for detecting atrial fibrillation ( AF ) have limited diagnostic yield. Continuous monitoring with automatic arrhythmia detection and classification may improve detection of AF. We prospectively studied a 312-patient ( pt ) subgroup of MOST ( MOde Selection Trial ), a 2010-patient trial with AF. The study aimed to quantify the incidence of AF in patients at high risk for but without previously known AF, and the best antithrombotic therapy in patients with AHRE ). The purpose of the study was to compare atrial high rate events ( AHREs ) detected by cardiac implantable electronic devices ( CRT-D ). A special Holter device stored 46 hours of subcutaneously recorded ECG, patient activity, and 2 surface ECG leads. The trial was stopped after 2 years median follow-up based on futility of finding a difference in primary endpoints between groups. A total of 945 patients ( 34.8 % ) developed AT, 264 meeting study anticoagulation criteria. The primary endpoint was adjudicated AF. Patients with persistent AF were marginally older ( 73 vs. 72, P = 0.03 ), less likely female ( 39 vs. 45 %, P < 0.0001 ), and more likely to have previously used vitamin K antagonists. The incidence of any AHRE was not significantly different between groups ( 2.4 vs. 2.3 per 100 patient-years ). In patients with AF, patients with detected AHRE>3.8 h over a day were similar ( P= 0.006 ).. The majority of patients ( 73 % ) did not show a temporal association with the detected atrial episode and their adverse event. This tool may increase patients’ quality of life and reduce risk of thrombo-embolic events. In paroxysmal AF, the combination of duration and frequency of episodes defines AF burdenAR-./+ ).., and "

RESULTS This is a secondary analysis of data from a population -based, double-blind, placebo-controlled, r and omized trial design. The long-term effects of calcium and vitamin D on the concentrations of serum lipids. Subjects were divided into 2 groups comparable with body mass index ( BMI ) and age. Group 1 was provided with calcium carbonate and 1-(OH)-vitamin D supplementation. Subjects with prediabetes and 25-OH vitamin D ( 25-OHD ) levels < 30 ng/mL were compared with placebo. The change in 25(OH)D from baseline was calculated. Analysis protocol s were applied to a sample of 35 older female adults ( mean age 73.7 ; SD 7.2 years ). Both groups received calcium citrate, 1000 mg/d. Serum vitamin D levels were measured.. The primary outcomes for the present study were changes in body weight and fat mass ( P < 0.01 ) and in spontaneous dietary lipid intake. In the placebo group, there was no significant change in weight, BMI, total fat, and percentage of trunk fat. In very low-calcium consumers, the change in fat mass was positively correlated with change in vitamin D. The effects of an intervention program on body fat mass in the vitamin D group were not significant. The differences in total : HDL and LDL : HDL were independent of changes in adiposity. The independent or interactive effects of Vitamin D and calcium on adiposity remain inconclusive.

31367297," BACKGROUND. To investigate the impact of atorvastatin therapy on oxidative stress, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, and thereby reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of atorvastatin 20 mg with either placebo ( group AP, n = 11 ) or d-alpha-tocopherol 750 IU ( group AE ). We performed a r and omized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial with two 2-month washout periods. After 12 weeks pravastatin treatment ( 20 mg daily ), plasma cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B ( Apo B ) decreased to a greater extent than atorvastatin alone ( 10 mg/day ). The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( TBARS ), and plasma lipid levels were measured before and after the statin treatment.. Plasma lipid peroxidation ( LPO ), malondialdehyde ( MDA ), that were measured in patients with diabetes, and renal function.. Serum triglyceride level did not change throughout the trial. The observed differences between simvastatin and placebo groups in the primary outcomes, serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ), urea, and creatinine. The mean value of TBARS levels was not significantly affected by the atorvastatin treatment, while the level of NO was non-significantly increased... The effect of statins on serum PNO1 activity and F1 + 2 levels ( p < 0.001 ), but the between-group difference was not significant.. We sought to address this issue by conducting a systematic review and meta- analysis of published data on plasma MDA levels, which, as expected, were significantly correlated with systemic MDA concentrations.. Conclusion : Atorvastatin alone or combined with statins treatment improves plasma oxidative stress markers, such as MDA,, but not related to the control and.).A"

16034862," A prospect i ve r and omized clinical trial was performed to determine the efficacy of single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis in the surgical management of appendicitis. A retrospective study of 82 patients showed a significant difference between the treated and a control group. The results show that the application of 1 g of ampicillin powder to the wound was significantly reduced than placebo. The rate of wound infection was the most common cause of acute abdominal pain requiring surgical intervention. The reason for antibiotic prophylaxis was unclear and the mechanism of pathogenesis. The majority of patients were administered antibiotics. Despite improved asepsis and surgical techniques, postoperative complications, such as wound infection and intraabdominal abscess, still account for a significant morbidity. CONCLUSIONS This review evaluated the use of antibiotics compared to placebo or no treatment in patients undergoing appendectomy. The cause of abdominal pain is to blame for the high rate of postoperative infections, the incidence of such infection is too low to warrant routine administration. The authors suggest that postoperative infections are reduced by administration of antimicrobial regimes.. Although improving the care of patients with appendiceal perforation. Although antimicrobial prophylaxis reduces postoperative morbidity, these patients benefit from antimicrobial prophylaxis."

To investigate the association between changes in the transversus abdominis muscle and clinical outcomes in patients with low back pain ( LBP ). The aim of this study was to determine if there was a relationship between the ability to recruit the abdominal muscles and the clinical outcome. Methods. The pain and disability associated with an initial episode of LBP, the most common pain, were recorded. The thickness of the rectus abdominis ( TrA ) and lumbar multifidus ( LM ), there were few studies on the efficacy of these muscle types.. The abdominal muscle activation was used to quantify the pain intensity ( 0–10 ) and pain ( 1–24 ). Data from 98 patients with chronic LBP were treated with two SMT sessions. The mean ± SD pain intensity, duration of pain, and other clinical features were assessed. The percentage change in LM-muscle activation was compared to the control group. The percent change in muscle thickness from baseline to after treatment was not significant. The ratio of muscle activation to pain intensity was significantly less ( P < 0.001 ). There was a positive correlation between baseline and post-therapy for the muscle activation. The study showed that the ratio of pain intensity to baseline was not significantly different between two groups. The average time to recovery was the same.. Although the ICC of total score for AMSTAR was 0.84 ( 95 % CI : 0.65, 0.92 ), a related systematic review is unavailable.

We investigated whether the effects of a herbal tea containing Salacia reticulata ( Kothala Himbutu treatment ) on glycemic control and the associated risk factors in the management of diabetes. The present study was designed to investigate a r and omized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial and it was conducted between April and December 2006 in Shanghai, China. The primary end point was the change in glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ), the secondary end points were compared between the 2 groups. The 49 subjects who completed this study were predominantly white with an average age of 65 years and a median duration of diabetes of 6 years. The control group received only oral hypoglycemic agents, whereas the intervention group received resveratrol ( 250 mg/d ) or placebo for 3 months. The participants completed the study and were assessed for the following:. The mean age was 63 years. In all 54 % were women and  the majority were African Americans ( 71 % ). The results reveal that supplementation of resveratrol for 6 months significantly improves the mean hemoglobin A(1c ), the total area under the curve values during the OGTT ( AUC0→2h ), and there was no significant change in any other measured variables. The HbA1C ( 1.67 ( sem 0.19 ), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and liver transaminase increased significantly. In conclusion, our study indicates that polyphenols have been extensively studied for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Recently, their antiglycative actions by oxidative stress modulation have been linked to the prevention of diabetes and associated complications..

32225172," OBJECTIVE : To determine the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) in extremely preterm infants. We conducted a double-blind, r and omized, controlled multicenter trial involving 235 preterm infants born before 28 weeks of gestation. The study was conducted at the St Louis Children's Hospital PICU on all patients who were admitted to the PICU from September 1, 1999, to May 31, 2000. A pediatric VAP prevention bundle was established and implemented. Baseline VAP rates were compared between groups. The primary outcome was the development of VAP. Secondary outcomes were death and NICU length of stay ( LOS ). The incidence of VAP was evaluated daily, and throat swabs and gastric aspirate were cultured at baseline and once or twice weekly thereafter. RESULTS : There were no statistically significant differences between the groups. VAP incidence was higher in the probiotics group ( 33.8 vs 48.3 ng/g creatinine, P =.006 ). There was no difference in mortality VAP ( odds ratio 0.7602 ; CI 95 % 0.3 - 1.6 ).. The VAP rate was reduced from 5.6 ( baseline ) to 0.03 infections per 1000 ventilatory days. The difference in microbial diversity was significantly lower in colostrum group ( 20 % vs. 33 %. P <.001 ). The study suggests that the diagnosis given at discharge ( adjusted odds ratio : 3.5 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1.2 - 10.8 ). A meta- analysis was conducted to investigate whether very low birth weight infants ( VLBWs ) can benefit from OC.

29341831," BACKGROUND : Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance ( MGUS ) have increased rates of bone resorption, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and risk of fractures. This study was undertaken to determine the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid for patients with multiple myeloma ( MM ). Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were r and omised to zoledronate, a marker for osteoblast activation, and placebo. No relevant side effects were recorded in patients with MM. In mouse myeloma models, inhibition of RANKL led to reduced serum paraprotein levels and tumor burden. Based on this hypothesis, this proof‐of‐concept study compared to placebo. Acute renal failure events were similar between groups ( ZOL 5·2 % vs. CLO 5·8 % at 2 years ; incidence plateaued thereafter ). The overall incidence of confirmed osteonecrosis of the jaw ( ONJ ) was low, but higher with ZOL ( 46 % ) and were more common in those with single episodes ( 13.4 versus 10.1 % ), although the difference was not statistically significant ( P = 0.009 ).. The pattern of relapses was different for the treated versus control patients : progressive bone disease ( 8 versus 20 ), anemia ( 24 versus 18 ), and the median time to progression ( 6.5 months ). In patients treated for ≥ 2 years, ZOL improved OS compared with CLO...,.. ;.. and.. Zoledronic acid treatment was associated with lower incidence of bone-related events ( P=0.03 )."

METHODS In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study, 514 men ( mean age 56 years ) with ED were enrolled and treated prospect ively. The efficacy of a single dose ( 25 mg or 50 mg ) of sildenafil or placebo. The men were first tested in the clinic with up to four doses of the drug ( 125, 250, 500, and 1000 microg ) ; those who had sufficient responses were r and omly assigned to treatment with either the effective dose of alprostadil or placebo for three months at home. RESULTS During in-clinic testing, 996 men ( 65.9 percent ) had erections sufficient for intercourse. The starting dose of sildenafil citrate was 50 mg, with the option to adjust the dose to 100 mg or 25 mg based on efficacy, and a partner question naire. CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that sildenafil, an effective oral therapy for the treatment of broad-spectrum ED, is associated with a near normalization of patient erectile function. In addition, 7 of 10 sildenafil than with placebo ( P < 0.05 ). The proportion of subjects who felt that treatment was successful at the end of their erection was significantly greater than the placebo."
23190278," BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of two different glass ionomer cements using the atraumatic restorative treatment ( ART ) approach in primary teeth. MATERIAL S AND METHODS Fifty-three Fuji IX and 45 ChemFil Superior restorations were placed in 208 children aged 6 through 10 years who had bilateral matched pairs of carious posterior Class I and II primary molars. The clinicians were assigned which material s to use in the ART.. The restorations were photographed at baseline and the patients were asked about postoperative sensitivity. After a period of 8 months, the restorations were evaluated by the clinicians were free to choose the restorative material. RESULTS After 2 years, all 76 restorations were reviewed. The mean survival rate of all single- and multiple-surface restorations was 86.2 %, whereas conventional GI restorations showed significantly shorter longevity. The studies indicated that the'new and improved  material s based on in vitro tests did not always show enhanced clinical properties. In the last study, a clear relation between the success rate of the composite restorations and caries lesions was found to be similar. The majority of restorations were successful, but the use of rubber dam restorations was 5.9 percent higher than that of  the GIC restorations. The main cause of failure was the loss of restoration. CONCLUSION This systematic review and meta- analysis aim ed to verify the efficacy of  occlusoproximal ART restorations to more closely match the restoration surfaces. The two-year clinical outcomes of  ART, but lower success rates are reported for occlusoparximal restorations."

MATERIAL S AND METHODS One hundred forty-four patients in need of 205 root teeth were selected and divided into two subgroups, depending on testing time ( immediate vs. 24-hours ), for push-out test. The results showed an improvement on the interfacial strength after 24 hours of storage. When data were pooled for each cement, three groups ( coronal, middle and apical ) of 2 mm thickness were prepared from each specimen. Sealing ability was quantified with a fluid-filtration system ( Flodec ). The restorations were followed for a minimum of 24 months. The composite core build-ups were prepared ensuring a circumferential 2-mm ferrule. The primary endpoint was a loss of restoration for any reason. To study group differences, the log-rank test was calculated ( P <.05 ). Hazard plots were constructed. RESULTS After 84 months of observation ( mean = 71.2 months ), 7 restorations failed ( ie, 4 GFREPs ), which was not significantly different from PAN ( 12.57+/-2.45 MPa ), but significantly higher than VAR ( 11.09+/-4.31 MPa ). No statistical difference was found between the survival rates to dentin, while relative failures included three instances of retention loss of the post/core and one post fracture. Although the probability of no failure was comparable for both post material s ( risk ratio, 95 % confidence interval, 0.965 - 0.851."

A total of 234 subjects were enrolled and omly assigned to complete the PASE by mail or telephone before or after a home visit assessment. These studies were conducted in several population s in California, Texas, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. The question naire, which assesses historical, past-year, and past-week leisure and occupational activity, was examined in 29 Pima individuals aged 21–36 yr and was shown to be reliable and to the same extent in the old ( 60 - 75 yr ) versus young ( 20 - 35 yr ). In a r and omized, one-year exercise trial, the mean difference between the 2 examinations was 0.93 ( P <.001 ), with an overall difference of 26 kcal/week, a typical error ( st and ard deviation of the differences ) of 171 kcals/week. The average percentage of bias was higher in women than in men and were stronger for younger respondents. The mean difference in PAQ scores were positively associated with grip strength ( r = 0.37 ) and -0.50, p less than 0.01 ).. Prevalence estimates were higher on the IPAQ than the BRFSS for the lowest category ( inactive ) by 0.1 - 3.9 % and for  the highest category ( meets recommendations ). The physical activity recall detected significant ( p < 0.05 ) increases in energy expenditure in treatment groups in two worksite health promotion projects. These data suggest that the PAQ is a reliable and feasible tool to use with the majority of older adults. The PAQ was both reliable and valid for measuring physical activity of various types and at different domains. The PPAQ was also and.)."

The group visit is a new treatment modality originating in managed care for efficient service delivery to patients with chronic health problems. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a 5-year r and omized controlled trial of outpatient diabetes care delivered by group versus individual diabetes care in a hospital-based secondary care diabetes unit. The patient population included 446 patients with non-insulin-treated diabetes, diagnosed with diabetes mellitus after 35 years of age, and accompanied by a family member or friend were included. The intervention consisted of 52 contact hours over 12 months and was provided by bilingual Mexican American nurses, dietitians, and community workers. The study included baseline and after the 2-week, 3-month, and 6-month education sessions. RESULTS Both educational setting s had similar improvements in knowledge, BMI, health-related quality of life, and tobacco use. Participants in both groups had improved blood pressure, lipid levels, and HbA1c levels during the observation period.. Process data collection revealed a significant increase in diabetes care-related activity for participating patients with an increase in structured annual review s and fewer patients defaulting from care. There were also significant improvements in information exchange between primary and secondary care. At 12 months, the mean percentage of patients in group visits had decreased ( -1.4, -2.0 to -0.7 ), and HDL cholesterol increased ( + 0.14 mmol/l, 0.07 - 0.22 ). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is ubiquitous. Complications and costs of diabetes are rising and are depleting limited re sources. It is imperative for healthcare professionals and patients alike to confront this chronic condition by exploring new interventions. An innovative health care delivery model has emerged in the last 25 years in terms of the group medical visit. and.A).}"
22005864," The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term survival of two different total knee arthroplasty types - cemented and uncemented. The design was identical in all parts. The knee systems used were the Rotaglide Total Knee System ( RTK ) and the Nuffield Total knee arthroplasty ( NTK ), both from the same manufacturer. The patients were contacted at a mean follow-up of 7.4 years ( 2.7 to 13.0 ) to establish the outcome of the tibial component. The ten-year survival was compared using life-table and Cox's proportional hazard analysis. The mean follow time was 3.5 ( range, 1–4.6 ) years. The survival at ten years was not significantly different between the 2 groups ( cemented vs cementless ; hazard ratio ( HR ) 0.83, 95 % CI 0.45 to 1.52, p = 0.55 ). In this retrospective study, the clinical outcome ( HSS Knee score ) was comparable to the baseline. The cost of treatment for the knee arthroplasty, mobile bearing, knee prosthesis, meniscal-bearing knee, posterior stabilized,. The results up to 2 years postoperatively were not significantly difference. The majority of patients with the implant as part of a total hip arthroplasty had a good clinical outcome, but the cost was considerably less than cemented metal-backed tibia components. We performed a systematic review to determine whether the results of lower-cost all-polyethylene transibial components were comparable with those of a more expensive cemented one-sided knee arthroplasty."
30017172," The role of resveratrol is considered to exert many beneficial actions, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, insulin-sensitizer and anticancer effects. Our aims were to investigate whether the resveratrol supplementation modulates inflammatory markers and the possible role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2)/antioxidant response element ( ARE ) pathway in an ischemia/reperfusion injured rat heart model. In this r and omized, double-blinded, controlled clinical trial, 50 healthy adult smokers were randomized into 2 groups : a resveratrol group receiving oral 2 × 5 mg resveratrol or a placebo capsule for 12 weeks. Both groups were advised to follow an energy-balanced diet and received physical activity recommendations . Serum inflammatory markers, activity of NF-κB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( P BMC ) and quality of life were assessed at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS : There was a significant reduction in plasma levels of TNF-α ( CRP ) and triglyceride concentrations, and increased Total Antioxidant Status ( TAS ). After 1 year, in contrast to the placebo and conventional grape extract groups, the Resveratrol-containing grape extract group showed an increase in serum inflammatory markers ( 0.47 ( 95%CI 0.38 - 0.59 ) -CRP and IL-6 levels, there were no significant changes of these factors in placebo group.. The evidence has suggested that resveratrol supplementation  improves insulin sensitivity in humans, that is, the transcriptional repressor LRRFIP-1 increased in P BMC s from patients taking the GE-RES extract. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of resveratrol supplementation on the levels of inflammatory markers through a systematic review and meta- analysis of available r and Omized controlled trials ( RCTs )."

Methods : Twelve patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were given either verapamil hydrochloride , 80 mg four times daily, or placebo in r and om order during two consecutive three-month periods. We evaluated carotid vascular resistance by using Doppler analysis and regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) by using 133Xe-clearance technique before and after the oral administration of perindopril. The relative risk of headache ( migraine or non-migrainous headache ) was estimated in relation to blood pressure at baseline. RESULTS : Those with a systolic blood pressure of 150 mm Hg or higher had 30 % lower risk ( risk ratio (RR)=0.7, 95 % CI 0.6–0.8 ) of having non-pyramidalous headache at follow up compared with those with systolic pressure lower than 140 mm Hg. For diastolic blood pressure, the percentage of patients with headache decreased with increasing values. Cerebral perfusion reserve ( CPR ) was similar for both sexes, and were not influenced by use of antihypertensive medication. For migraine, there was no clear association with blood pressure. The mean placebo-corrected BP fall of 17/10 mm Hg was seen ( P = 0.017 ), which was maximal at 5.5 hours. There was no significant difference in blood pressure levels between these two groups throughout the study period. The calculated CBF index increased significantly after each drug ( 25.23 ± 7.99 on placebo vs 33.98 ± 11.23 p < 0.01 on perindopril and 30.90 ± 8.04 on acebutolol. For this drug, variant II was most typical in patients without ICA stenosis and with moderate ICA stenosis..

The surgical procedure was compared with conventional laparoscopic repair.. The feasibility of laparoscopy is widely used for hernia repair. The study was conducted to compare the systemic inflammatory response to surgical trauma and the clinical outcomes in patients who underwent surgery under local anesthesia ( n = 30 ) or LR under general anesthesia.. Methods : Thirty-two male patients ( age range 25 to 60 years ) with a bilateral inguinal hernia were r and omized to suture or mesh repair.  In 2003, follow-up was up date d. The primary end point was postoperative pain. The patients were interviewed at outpatient clinics at 1 week, 6, 12, and 24 hours after the repairs.. Postoperative visual analogue scales for pain were recorded.  Hospital stay ( 1 [ IQR, 0 to 1 ] day, time to return to normal activities, and mean visual analogue scale ( VAS ) ) was also significantly reduced after surgery. The other markers did not increase significantly. The mean postoperative inflammatory response was more pronounced after OR, even when this was done under controlled conditions. The median pain score 2 h postoperatively during rest was significantly higher in the conventional group ( P < 0.05 ) but the number of leucocytes, monocytes, and hemoglobin were similar between the groups ( p = 0.03 ). There was no difference in pain during the 1st and 7th post-operative, physical functioning, and postoperative convalescence. The two groups were well matched for age, sex, ASA score, and preoperative values. The operation took longer ( p <.001. The inflammatory response after surgery appears to be more complex and modulated by cytokines. The primary outcome was that the surgical procedures elicit a complex systemic inflammation response effectuated and modulated with the serum markers associated with hernia repair and to explore the relationship. and)."

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS. In this cohort study, 22 healthy volunteers ( mean age 18.5 ± 4.2 years ) underwent two 75-g oral glucose tolerance tests with frequent measurements of glucose, insulin, and GLP-1.. The participants were 9 to 14 years old in 1996 and completed question naires in 1996, 1997, and 1998. We analyzed change in BMI ( kilograms per meter squared ) and subjective appetite were measured in response to sweetened preloads of either a SPLENDA Sucralose control, glucose or whey protein made up to 250 ml with water,.. During maintenance and follow-up, participants in the aspartame group were significantly higher than placebo group ( AUC 24.0 ± 15.2 pmol/l per 180 min ). The main outcome measure was the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus... Evidence of a causal relationship linking artificial sweetener use to weight gain and other metabolic health effects is limited.. However, recent animal studies provide intriguing information that supports an active metabolic role of artificial sweeteners. This systematic review examines the current literature on the relationship between intake of sweeteners and weight gain.. This study suggests that consumption of sweeteners was associated with increased weight overall ( P = 0.028 ) and increased the risk of obesity. The study also demonstrates that the study population was not obese. The association between artificial sweeteners use and  weight gain that was not observed.

23001018," BACKGROUND : Recent studies have investigated the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF ), but the absolute rate of stroke varies widely among the population with AF. We reported in a prospect i ve study that at 27-month follow-up, echocardiographic left ventricular ( LV ) hypertrophy in elderly patients with AF was associated with an increased incidence of stroke. The purpose of this study was to compare the cost and quality -adjusted survival of various antithrombotic therapies. We studied the predictive value of several easily obtainable clinical characteristics in a group of 375 patients with NRAF and a recent episode of transient or thromboembolism. The primary objective is to determine whether rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin for the primary end point of stroke or systemic embolism.. The secondary objective tests feasibility of TEE as a tool to detect early stroke.. : The primary outcome measures Quality adjusted life years ( QALYs ) gained and incremental cost per QALY of dabigatran compared with warwarfarin. Results : Among patients with the lowest stroke rate ( CHADS2, 0.5 % versus 1.8 % ; adjusted rate ratio [ RR ], 1.6, P<0.001 ), the majority of patients were older than 60 years... In the cohort study, the incidence of the stroke ( 1.0 % vs. 1.3 %, P=0.018 ), and the incremental risk scores of dabigatran vs. placebo in recent onset of AF, were lower than in previous studies...

24635850," OBJECTIVE To compare responsiveness and predictive ability of clinical and instrumented spasticity assessment s after botulinum toxin type A ( BTX ) treatment combined with casting in children with spastic elbow muscles. In biomedical research and clinical diagnosis, motor events frequently are determined from surface electromyographic ( SEMG ) signals by some computerized detection algorithm... Two repeated measures, one before and another four weeks after treatment, were taken to quantify clinical efficacy. Outcome measures : Elbow flexor spasticity was simultaneously rated with the modified Ashworth scale ( MAS ) and quantified by measuring the surface EMG from the flexors using a custom-built device. Based upon a dynamic process model for the SEMG signal, a formal detection scheme is established which incorporates the essential processing modules common to the majority of algorithms. The angle of spastic catch ( AOC ) was estimated by three biomechanical definitions : joint angle at ( 1 ) maximum angular deceleration ; ( 2 ) maximum change in torque ; and ( 3 ) minimum power. Each definition was checked for reliability and validity. Construct and clinical validity were evaluated by correlating each AOC definition to an averaged root mean square envelope of EMG ( RMS-EMG ) and the Modified Tardieu Scale ( MTS ). Results show that the measurements of viscous component and averaged viscosity during manual sinusoidal stretching using the portable device could be clinical ly useful in evaluating spasticity. The first aim of this study was to systematic ally review and critically assess manually controlled instrumented senasticity assessment methods that combine multidimensional signals. The second aim was theoretically extract a set of quantified parameters that are psychometrically sound to assess spasticity in a clinical setting."
22984894," We undertook a prospect i ve, r and omised study using a computer-assisted total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) and patients operated with conventional techniques. The patients were divided into two groups to compare the clinical outcomes of the two methods. The surgery was performed according to the Perth CT Knee Arthroplasty protocol, while for patients of group B the conventional method. All patients were operated on with a minimal invasive, mini-midvastus surgical approach. The postoperative mean values for the various measurements showed no significant difference in component alignment. The average postoperative knee function was comparable in the 2 groups. The mean femoral and tibial mechanical anteroposterior axis and the mean postoperative knee flexion ( p = 0.001 ), the average postoperative time was less than the control group ( the intramedullary guide group ). This systematic review was undertaken to assess the safety and effectiveness of navigated TKA through the medial parapatellar approach compared with conventional TKA. The overall postoperative knee alignment was similar between the groups. The patient group of this study was also found to have similar postoperative knee osteoarthritis.

The incidence of recurrent stroke in the majority of patients with coronary disease, who have average levels. The median follow-up time was 58 months. Further RIAs were reported by 91 patients ( 45 % ) and 48 ( 24 % ) suffered a stroke. The risk of stroke was markedly higher in those who had baseline total and LDL cholesterol levels ( mean, 209 and 139 mg/dL, respectively ). After adjustment for known prognostic factors, higher serum cholesterol concentrations were associated with reduced long term mortality. The mean age of patients was 5.9 years, which is significantly higher than expected. The primary outcome was total stroke ( ischaemic and haemorrhagic ) within 90 days. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of stroke type, vascular territory and extent, age, and hyperglycaemia.

The hazards for a GP are too many diagnostic interventions for the population aged 65 years and over. The study is part of the Rotterdam study, a population -based prospect i ve cohort study of AF. The first cohort included 50 primary care teams in four clusters : North, South & West, City I and City II.  AF  was diagnosed in 4.8 % of women and in 6.2 % of men at the baseline examination. We used hospital diagnosis data from the Danish National Hospital Discharge Register to determine the rate of first hospital admission for AF. During a 5-year follow-up period, the eligible participants were compared with non-AF controls. The main outcome was the difference in explained episodes.. The incidence rate in the age group 55 - 59 years was 1.1/1000 person-years, and the incidence rate was 2.6 %. The rate of hospital admissions for AF was greater in men than in those aged 85 years and above. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio for 30-day mortality for AF compared with the control group was significantly greater ( OR 1.46 95 % CI 1.5–1.9. The lifetime risk to develop AF in men and women was higher than that of those without the disease.

We r and omly assigned 150 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty with spinal anesthesia to receive either no warming, two hours of warming immediately after surgery ; or seven days of warming. The patients undergoing surgery were compared using one-way ANOVA. Patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized to either the A rct ic Sun System alone ( control group ) or with the additional warming ( Bair Hugger ® group ). We applied warming for at least 30 min before surgery. Perioperative transfusion was based on international guidelines. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS The mean skin temperature was significantly lower in the warming group than the control group ( 36.6 ± 0.3 ° C vs. 35.3 ± 0.5 ° C, P < 0.001 ). There was no significant difference between the two CPB groups in blood loss or transfusion requirements. The two groups had similar intraoperative blood loss. The mean ( + /- SD ) final intraoperative core temperature were similar between groups on intensive care unit admission. In the postoperative rewarming group, there were significantly larger postoperative wound temperature and shorter duration of time < 36 ° C ( 2.5 [ 0–22 ] min, respectively.. ), than after rewarming.

We examined the efficacy and safety of the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor sertraline hydrochloride, and with diazepam and placebo, in a cross-over design. The strongest predictors of response to alprazolam, the proportion of patients remaining on single-agent treatment or requiring multiple medications or placebo for the first 8 weeks of treatment. Both alprazolam treatment groups ( 6 mg and 2 mg ) had significantly higher than patients on placebo. At 8 weeks, however, the group receiving imipramine combined with exposure therapy displayed more improvement than the other two groups. The primary binary outcome from each meta- analysis was considered the primary outcome for all trials included in this study. The association between alprazolam and conclusions was analyzed by logistic regression with adjustment for treatment effect, adverse events, and other confounding factors ( method ological quality, control intervention, sample size, publication year, and place of publication ). BACKGROUND Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent unexpected panic attacks consisting of a wave of intense fear that reaches a peak within a few minutes. Although panic disorder is treated with psychological and pharmacological interventions, particularly the use of benzodiazepines, as first-line treatment for panic disorder, neither this group nor the Placebo + exposure group showed a reduction in panic attacks. The results of these recommendations, although they are based on anecdotal evidence, are not fully understood and are probably heterogeneous. Panic disorder are frequently used with psychological interventions, mainly benzodiazolepines. Although benzodiazolidepines are widely used in treating panic disorder, particularly because of their rapid onset of action, their lower incidence of dependence and withdrawal reaction when compared to anxiolytics.

A prospect i ve study was conducted of 165 patients with diabetes mellitus, the intervention group, and control group, to compare the outcomes of diabetes mellitus patients in a primary care setting in China. The intervention group received care from an NSD who treated glycaemia, blood pressure and lipid profile, and the control group received usual care. The patients in the study group were cared for by a physician. The primary endpoint was the main decrease in HbA1c. Secondary endpoints included blood pressure, lipid profile.. The control group attended eight annual consultations. The mean age was 59 years, diabetes duration was 6 years, and blood pressure was 129/74 mmHg. In the experimental group ( SG ; 22 general practice s ), there was a significant improvement in diabetes management, χ(2)-test and mixed model analysis. The study intervention consisted of 4 weekly group sessions ( less use of insulin ), and when patients had elevated glucose levels during clinic visits, therapy was less than half as likely to be advanced to the same level as the controls.. Mean SBPs of eligible intervention patients were 2.4 mm Hg lower ( 95 % CI : −3.4 to −1.5 ; P = 0.05 ). Treatment of diabetes in a rural, community-based setting appeared to reduce inappropriate prescribing, enhance disease management, and improve health-related quality of life.

24698343," OBJECTIVE Fructose has been implicated in obesity, partly due to lack of insulin-mediated leptin stimulation and ghrelin suppression. Because an increased intake of fructose is specifically related to a dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, we hypothesized that an acute catalytic dose of fructose would also improve glucose tolerance in individuals with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Five healthy adult volunteers were studied in a r and omised order after 7 d of the following diets : ( 1 ) weight maintenance, control diet ; ( 2 ) HFrD ( 3.5 g fructose/kg fat-free mass ( ffm ) per d, + 35 % energy intake ).. Total plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were measured at baseline and during the 10th week of intervention. The changes in insulin binding and insulin sensitivity correlated linearly ( r = 0.52, P less than 0.01 ). We conclude that fructose seems to be responsible for the observed changes in blood lipids. The mean AUC for glucose was not different between the two visits ( P > 0.05 ). The study was to review the current corpus of human studies to determine the association of various doses and duration s of fructose consumption on metabolic syndrome."

19025503," Background Clinical guidelines are considered important instruments to improve quality in health care. In physiotherapy, insight in adherence to guidelines is limited. Knowledge of adherence is important to identify barriers and to enhance implementation. Purpose of this survey is to describe the quantity and quality of r and omised controlled trials and the quality of systematic review s relevant to physiotherapy. The Physiotherapy Evidence Data base ( PEDro ) was search ed. The quality of trials was assessed with the PEDro scale. The control group received the guidelines by mail ( st and ard passive method of dissemination ). The intervention group, in contrast, received an additional active training strategy consisting of 2 sessions with education, group discussion, role playing, feedback, and reminders.  Patients with low back pain, treated by the participating therapists, completed question naires on physical functioning, pain, sick leave, coping, and beliefs. RESULTS There were no significant differences between groups for any of the patient outcomes at any time. The implementation patients had 0.6 points ( 95 % CI -7.8 to 6.6 ). Primarily because of its low unit cost, sending printed information to large numbers of practitioners is an attractive dissemination and implementation strategy. The physiotherapy clinical guidelines are not recommended if the patients' clinical management of their pain is included in all models generated. Varying the statistical techniques also result ed in a different prognostic model with some change to the amount of variance explained. Conclusion. A substantial proportion of patients still experienced some pain and disability at 12 months following intervention. The active strategy moderately improved the effectiveness of physiotherapy practice, patient outcomes and cost of care. The number of treatment options between the intervention and control groups."
28942899," Background Clinical practice guidelines are important for transmitting research findings into practice and facilitating the application of evidence -based practice.

Summing the positive and negative differences between actual and calculated numbers of patients with > 50%maxTOTPAR gave an average difference of 0.30 patients per treatment arm. Reports of RCTs of analgesics frequently describe results of studies in terms of pain, the majority of patients showing disease regression, and 10 ( 42 % ) having static disease. While these treatments are very successful there is still a 20 - 25 % failure rate and surgery has been an option for cases of the cervical sensory nerve fibres.. Conservative therapy for dysmenorrhoea includes oral contraceptive pills ( OCP ) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDS ) which both act by suppressing prostagl and in levels. Although these procedures both interrupt the vast majority of nerve fibres, thus diminishing uterine pain. Uterine nerve ablation  ( UNA ) and postsacral neurection ( PSN ) are two surgical treattreatments that have become increasingly utilised in recent years. Primary dysmenorrhoea is the occurrence of painful menstrual cramps of uterine origin and is a very common gynaecological complaint. Medical therapies for primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea include oral contraceptives ( OCP ), and non-steroidal agents and..). treatment is not always successful and surgery may not always benefit from this type of surgery."
30627441," BACKGROUND Although effective as a monotherapy for the treatment of acne scars, the 1,450-nm diode laser is associated with considerable pain and minimal epidermal ablation. The efficacy and safety of a long‐pulse neodymium‐doped yttrium aluminium garnet ( Nd : YAG ) laser was recently introduced. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and efficacy of a 1,550-nm fractional laser for acne scars and to assess the safety of the laser in acne scars. METHODS Nineteen patients with acne scars were enrolled in this study. Two blinded dermatologists who compared before and after photos based on a quartile grading scale conducted objective clinical assessment s of acne scar. Each group of 20 patients received three treatments at 4-week interval using Er : Glass fractional laser or laser plus radiofrequency. The mean pain rating was significantly lower after the first treatment. The scars were either shallow or deep, varied in size from 2 to 20 mm and ranged in number from 10 to 50. The patients were evaluated using digital photography at each treatment visit and at 3 months postoperatively. Results : Acne scarring was not statistically significant difference between the groups. The boxcar scars ( 52.9 % ) responded better than the rolling ( 43.1 % ) and ice‐pick scars ( 25 % ), with statistically significant improvement ( p <.05 ). The side effects, including pain, post-treatment erythema, and edema, were resolved. Conclusion : Both modalities have good efficacy in treating atrophic scars. The authors have indicated no significant adverse reactions. The treatment modality is a very common problem, which can be extensive, and may lead to significant psychosocial morbidity.. Multiple types of treatment modalities are used to ameliorate acne scarring...Agency). and.

Two hundred participants with knee OA of hip or knee, or both ( clinical American College of Rheumatology, ACR, criteria ) participated in the study. Prospect i ve cohort study in community-dwelling adults in North Staffordshire. PATIENTS AND METHODS The eighteen-level self-administered scale was developed with the aid of content experts to ensure face validity. Changes in pain ( Visual Analog Scale, VAS ), physical functioning ( Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, WOMAC, and McMaster Toronto Arthritis Question naire, MACTAR ), and patient global assessment were compared for specific subgroups. Results : Three clinical history variables ( bilateral knee pain, duration of morning stiffness and inactivity gelling ) were independently associated with poor outcome. The addition of the “ clinical history ” model to the ` generic ”model led to a statistical improvement in model fit ( likelihood ratio ( LR ) = 24.84, p = 0.001 ). Two physical examination variables ( knee tender point count and single-leg balance ). The results showed significant strength gains ( p <.05 ), which occurred over a wider velocity spectrum for the exercise group... The strength strength was significantly associated with clinical outcomes.. the quality of knee and hip osteoarthritis, but did not lead to any significant effect on physical function, but a much less costly education program also showed some benefits. The study also showed that pain and physical performance measures were strongly related to self-efficacy.

12804458," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of a cluster visit model to treat diabetes. We conducted a controlled prospect i ve r and omized feasibility study of the effects of a diabetes team ( a diabetes nurse educator and an endocrinologist ) on the length of stay and other outcomes of diabetes mellitus. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 272 diabetic patients ( mean age= 13.3 years ) were randomized to receive either intervention or control groups. The intervention group participated in courses of three weekly lessons presented by a physician, nurse, and dietitian. The outcome measures were the duration of diabetes, diabetes knowledge, and teaching were done in their homes by the same staff. RESULTS The 34 patients who attended both education sessions improved their self-care, symptoms, and satisfaction with care. After the intervention group, the mean improvement over baseline was 14 %. The patients also reported improved satisfaction with their diabetes. In the control group the difference in weight loss was less ( 5.5 ( 4–6.5 ) vs 3 ( 2–4 ) kg, p < 0.05 ). The patient with diabetes had many different learning needs than would be expected by chance. The control group was compared with an intervention subgroup ( n=52 ) also without patients receiving OHA. The two groups did not differ for HbA(1c ), they experienced more problems with social functioning and pain. CONCLUSIONS A 6-month cluster visit group model of care for adults with diabetes improved glycemic control, self-efficacy, and patient satisfaction and result ed in a reduction in the metabolic control of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The present review aims to assess the roles of diabetes specialist nurses , compared to usual care in hospital clinics or primary care with no input from specialist nurses."
27374001," This study compares the effectiveness of a pre-operative rehabilitation program for patients having total hip replacement ( THR ). A prospect i ve observational cohort study was undertaken before operation and at follow-up six months later.. Fifty patients from two hospitals were r and omized into a study group ( SG ) of 27 patients receiving preoperative and postoperative education programs, as well as home visits from an outpatient team. The control group received no therapy. The single score derived from the question naire had a high internal consistency. The preoperative group and booklet, however, seemed to have lower VAS pain scores on the first post-operative day, more subjects climbing stairs normally and walking unlimited at 6 weeks, and higher HOOS Symptoms scores at 3 months. There were no significant differences between groups at later time points.Conclusion : Patterns of subsequent care were driven more by initial setting than by etiology. The intervention group experienced a greater amount of time up and ambulating with the therapists at the 2nd day after hip arthroplasty. The ratio of the hip joint to the control group was not improved after the assessment. The postoperative functional recovery of hip joint, the Harris scores and the X-ray were analyzed and compared between two groups. CONCLUSIONS To assess the effects of provision of assistive devices, education on hip pre caution s, environmental modifications and training in activities of daily living ( ADL ) and extended ADL ( EADL ) for people undergoing THA. CONCLUSIONS Both freest and ing SNFs and IRFs provided similar amounts of PT with a similar emphasis on exercise and gait activities.. Following THA, people have conventionally been provided with equipment, such as raised toilet seats and chairs, and educated to avoid activities that could lead to hip joint instability and/or flexion.A. After THA the majority of people in the study population were provided with rehabilitation, either with assistive device to be in a position of flexion over 90 degrees, or adduction or rotation past the midline."

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a structured individual-based lifestyle education program that could be used by physicians in their daily outpatient practice to promote the adoption and maintenance of physical activity ( PA ). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The long-term ( 2-year ) efficacy of the treatment conditions : clinic and community ( group A ), clinic only ( group B ), and minimal intervention ( group C ). The intervention group received < 30 min of monthly interviews based on the program's textbook and biweekly telephone calls from a nurse educator throughout the 12 months. RESULTS Of the 50 participants in the intervention group and the 25 participants in control group, 42 and 23 %, respectively, completed the study. The outcomes were glycemic control, the percentage of participants with diabetes, and outcomes ( PA, glycaemia, and quality of life. The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c levels at 6 months from baseline. The secondary endpoints were the changes in PA levels between groups at 6 and 12 months by accelerometer, which was worn while awake for 7 days.. Results After 6 months of follow-up, there was significant improvement in PA. The majority of PA interventions were effective and practical to implement in clinical practice setting s.. The mean change in PA among the participants was significant... P < 0.05 ).. The incidence of PA and glycemic control were significantly greater for the PA interventions than the control group ( P = 0.04 ).

29219092," OBJECTIVE To examine the influence of  early childhood television viewing  on the health indicators of children aged 2 years. Design : Nationally representative prospect i ve cohort study. SETTING Institut de la Statistique du Québec, Québec. Methods : Participants are 991 girls and 1,006 boys from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development. The main predictor comprised parent-reported daily televiewing by their children at 29 months. In the sixth grade, children reported how often they experienced victimization by classmates in the past year. The authors conducted multivariate linear regression, in which child self-reports of victimization were linearly regressed on early telescoping, and the outcomes were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Question naire ( SDQ ). RESULTS : Every SD increase ( 1.2 h ) in daily telomere length was associated with the child's BMI, triceps, and sum of five skinfolds. In a mutually adjusted model, children were more likely to gain weight rapidly if they had a higher body mass index at age 3 (. ), less TV viewing time, and lower child's birth weight as well as maternal healthy prepregnancy weight status. The odds ratio of being in  the highest quintile of % change in WHtR was 1.26 ( 95 % CI : 1.17 to -0.20 ), and mean st and ard deviation score for the overall motor skills score. Also, children whose parents had lower levels of education and were engaged in agriculture, often had significant speech disorders, ( p<0.01 ). CONCLUSIONS The purpose of this systematic review was to examine whether the relationships between  sedentary behaviour ( SB ) and health indicators in children aged 0 to 4 years, to determine what doses of SB ( i.e., duration, patterns [ frequency ], and type ) were associated with health indicators."
30388164," Background This study examines the relationship between the development in pedometer-determined walking behavior from 2007–2008 to 2011–2012 in the adult Danish population. Methods : The study population comprised two r and om sample s of 18–75-year-old individuals ( aged 5 - 19 years ) were recruited through their parents. The outcome variables were self-reported daily step counts, the intervention group ( n = 57 ), and the control group. The participants ( N = 124 participants ; mean age 14.1 + /-.8 years ) completed the International Physical Activity Question naire ( IPAQ ) and a pedometer log.. Results of structural equation modeling supported a model in which perceptions of autonomy support from a PE teacher positively predicted PE-related need satisfaction ( autonomy, competence, and relatedness ). The odds of being overweight and obese by steps/day and parent-reported time spent television watching were estimated using logistic regression. The outcomes of interest were:.. The proportion of individuals taking ⩾10,000 steps /day ( p=0.044 ) and an incidental walking group ( p = 0.001 ).. There was also no association between night-time safety reports and physical activity among men ( F = 7.4, p =.01, d =.80 ). PA  was greatest at ( and subsequent to ) times when body satisfaction was lower, and when disinhibited eating and hedonic hunger were higher, than an individual ’s average ( p < 0.05 ).Conclusion : Levels of physical activity were not as high as might be expected. The study shows that the majority of participants walked more than those with low goals, even if they do not meet the assigned goal. In response to this problem, physical activity programs have become popular, with step counts commonly used to measure program performance.. Regular engagement in physical activity can produce immediate and long term health benefits.. Although the study population was not as large as the global World Health Organization ( WHO ) 2017 statistics, it is therefore an essential component of a healthy lifestyle."
26164054," OBJECTIVE This prospect i ve observational study was design ed to explore the relationships between  post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ),  patients'memories of the intensive care unit ( ICU ) and sedation practice.. Methods Forty-three patients who were mechanically ventilated in the medical and coronary ICUs of a university-based medical center were prospect ively followed during their ICU admission for PTSD. The study was designed ed as a r and omized, single-blind ( ie, patient only ), placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial involving administration of alprazolam. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the PTSD Symptom Scale, and anxiety symptoms were measured with visual analogue rating scales. The goal of this study was to analyze and summarize evidence concerning the efficacy of BZDs in treating PTSD. RESULTS : Benzodiazepine use ( n= 57 ) or non-use ( n = 226 ). Pre-set cut-off behavioral criteria classified exposed animals according to their EPM and ASR response-patterns into'extreme ','minimal,'or'partial'behavioral response for analysis of prevalence rates.. The development of PTSD following critical illness is associated with a number of different precipitating factors that are in part related to how patients are cared for within intensive care. This study raises the hypothesis that the impact of care within the ICU has an impact on subsequent psychological morbidity and therefore must be assessed in future studies looking at the way patients are se date and the outcomes of their care. The small sample size was a significant limitation of our study. Although benzodiazepines ( BZDs ) are commonly used in treatment of PTSD, the study found no evidence of a significant difference in this treatment."

23739312," BACKGROUND Depression is a remitting but recurring disease. The effects of two types of interventions for depressed adults in the community and their families. The study design was a randomized controlled trial. Patients attended a 12-session psychoeducational programme over a period of 10 weeks, with follow-up at 26 weeks. The main outcome measures were the self-report Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI-II ), the Global Severity Index ( GSI ) of the Brief Symptom Inventory ( BSI ) and the EuroQol 5D. Results : Members of families who received FFT showed more positive nonverbal interactional behavior during a 1-year posttreatment period, 47 % ( 95 % CI, 36 to 58 % ). The intervention included 8 weekly sessions of psychoeducation, they did not differ significantly in that outcome. Overall, these results suggest that these two interventions are effective for treating low- to moderate-level depression. In spite of this, a significant number of patients do not respond adequately to treatment based only on medication, presenting high relapse and recurrence rates. For the intervention that delivered cognitive behaviour therapy the reduction in score on the depression scale was significant than that for controls, but there were only a few statistically significant differences between the two groups.. The mean difference in Beck depression inventory score was −2.63 ( 95 percent confidence interval −4.95 to −0.32 ). Conclusion : Pharmacological treatment is considered indispensable to major depressive disorder. The present systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of psychoeducation  for patients with unipolar depression.. Although the evidence from the literature was insufficient, the present study suggests that psychoeducation. The evidence from clinical trials is promising. The literature review revealed that psychosocial interventions  for depression, such as psychoeducation, have been increasingly recognized as an essential component in treating depression, associated with pharmacological strategies."
19148113," OBJECTIVE To assess the effects of a multidisciplinary infant development program ( NIDCAP ) for very low birth weight ( VLBW ) infants on the basis of a neurodevelopmental assessment scale. The intervention, given weekly at home from six months to 12 months, to those with follow-up only ( FUO ). Infants in the control group ( n = 40 ) were offered a developmental intervention, which included the usual care, and a social support intervention. The study population consisted of 649 low birthweight infants ( LBWI ; 1000 -1999 g ). The outcomes at 12 months were assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 1 year of age.. The control group received all the postnatal care and referrals customarily given in traditional care. At age 8, the children in both groups were enrolled in a longitudinal study between 1989 and 1991. The early-discharge group were diagnosed as having bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and comparison groups were those who were born at term. The odds ratio for being alive with an MDI>80 was 14 ( 95 % CI ; 1.4 - 141.5 ). There was an over-representation of the positive effects of early intervention, including improved cognitive development, increased coherence between frontal and a broad spectrum of mainly occipital brain regions, and higher relative anisotropy in left internal capsule. These effects were all substantially higher than corresponding ITT effects.. Similar but smaller effects were found for children who attended > 350 days."
31210136," Objective To estimate the cost-effectiveness of Tobacco, Exercise and Diet Messages ( TEXT ME ), a text message-based intervention that provides advice, motivation, information and support to improve health-related behaviours. Methods A lifetime Markov model was used to estimate major vascular events ( myocardial infa rct ions and strokes ) avoided, quality -adjusted life years ( QALYs ) gained, costs to the health system and the incremental cost per QALY gained. The model was informed by data from a r and omised controlled trial of TEXT ME, with evidence from systematic review s and meta-analyses used through a payer perspective. Unit costs were estimated using the Truven Health MarketScan data base from April 2008 to March 2013. Over a 5‐year horizon, patients in the Treatment group had average QALYs of 2.56 with a total cost of US$ 56 974 ; patients in The Control group had QALYs and 1143 additional QALYs.  TEXT ME is expected to lead to an incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) was US$ 12 262 per QALY. Using comprehensive cost modelling, including all anticipated costs of HF and non‐HF hospitalizations, physician visits, prescription drugs, long‐term care, and outpatient hospital visits. Neither parameter nor structural uncertainty had a significant impact on the conclusion that TEXT ME was cost-effective. Conclusions The provision of TEXTME is predicted to result to better health outcomes and an overall saving in costs for the healthcare system.

This investigation assessed the relation between demographic, clinical, mobility and balance metrics and falls. Methods : Self-reported incidents during the three months following a st and ardized test procedure. Subjects : Seventy-six people with multiple sclerosis and an Exp and ed Disability Status Scale score between 3.5 and 6.0.. One hundred seventeen ( 117 ) falls occurred in 82 patients during a time when the unit census was 28,622 patient days. The  Clock Drawing Test ( CDT ) and the Frontal Assessment Battery ( FAB ) were used in the assessment of the executive functions. Results : After 6 months, the SCIM II scores of subjects showed a slight decrease ( 58.60±21.22–58.37±22.06 scores ). The number of falls was obtained by means of a question naire. We observed that falls were significantly worse than in controls ( P<0.05 ).. The interobserver reliability was quantified using Kendall ’s coefficient of concordance ( OR 1.14, CI 1.02 ; 1.31 ), and a decreased stride length ( OR = 1.1 ; 95 % Cl = 0.0 - 1.3 ). These abnormalities were all significantly greater in fallers compared to nonfallers. The predictive accuracy of these findings for falls was not associated with the gait and balance variables."

26777297," BACKGROUND Cannabis use has been found to increase the risk of psychosis.  It is unclear whether, after a first psychotic episode has occurred, continued cannabis use is associated with poor functional outcome of schizophrenia. AIM To examine the relationship between cannabis use and clinical outcome, including whether change in cannabis use affects symptoms and functioning, in a large sample of people with established nonaffective psychosis and comorbid substance misuse. METHODS In a representative cohort of 145 participants whose substance use included cannabis were compared with other substance users ( n = 167 ) on baseline demographic, clinical, and substance use variables.. The cannabis using subgroup was examined prospect ively with repeated measures of substance use and psychopathology at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months. We used generalized estimating equation models to estimate the effects of cannabis use on symptoms, global functioning and psychotic relapse. RESULTS There was no evidence of a specific association between cannabis abuse and positive symptoms, or negative symptoms, relapse or hospital admissions... Continued cannabis use was not associated with subsequent severity of psychotic symptoms or clinical recovery.. Although the link between Cannabis use and development of psychosis is well established, less is known about the effect of continued versus discontinued cannabis use after the onset of psychosis,.. We aim ed to summarise available evidence focusing on the role of continued and withdrawn cannabis use in psychosis.."

The present r and omized controlled trial ( Clinical trials.gov identifier : NCT01072500 ) that will provide definitive evidence regarding the effect of physical activity ( PA ) on the performance on a motor-cognitive dual task. Methods : To test whether the Nijmegen Falls Prevention Program was effective in reducing falls and improving st and ing balance, balance confidence, and obstacle avoidance performance. The study involved 17 elderly men ( 68.4±2.9 years of age, ranging between 65 and 74 years ). Mean velocity of the center of pressure ( COP ), and data obtained for 10 subjects were used for data analysis ( 2 control subjects were eliminated to allow for matched-pairs analysis between the experimental and control groups ). The control group ( n=5 ) had a mean age of 80.2 years ( SD=7.8 ).. The exercise group showed significantly better motor performance at “ Post ” and “ Retention ” ( 8 weeks later ). After the 12-month intervention period, both groups showed significant improvements in motor performance.. Higher concentrations of norepinephrine and lactate immediately after exercise were associated with better acquisition. The positive effects of acute exercise on motor performance were maximized when exercise was performed immediately after practice. The results of our study indicated that the association between chronic physical activity and acute bouts of exercise on gait and motor performance in older adults. Therefore, the improvement in gait performance as indicated by the increase in the COP displacements velocity may be related to the level of motor learning processes. However, this review aim ed that regular and acute physical activity might facilitate motor performance tasks. The older adults may need to maintain, learn new and relearn known motor skills."

METHODS Fifty-six cases of NPC were r and omly divided into two groups, 28 in each group. They were treated with radiotherapy in routine or chemotherapy adopting AD protocol. RESULTS The results yielded 47 trials in which six types of acupuncture treatments were applied to 36 diseases ranging from breech presentation to digestive disorders. The therapeutic effect of treatment was evaluated according to the immediate effect, living quality scoring, etc. The comprehensive living quality score and Karnofsky score dropped significantly in the control group after treatment with significant increase of pain score and decrease of tongue figure score ( P < 0.05 ). The 5-year local control rates of NPC and cervical lymphnode were 85.7 % and 85.0 % after the intervention. The mucosal expression of transforming growth factor alpha(TGF-alpha ) was detected by radioimmunoassay. For those in  the TCM combined group, all the four criteria were improved in a subset of these regions. In studies that examined interventions other than acupuncture, 405 of 1100 abstract s met the inclusion criteria. Of trials published in Engl and, 75 % gave the test treatment as superior to control. The results for China, Japan, Russia/USSR, and Taiwan were 99 %, 89 %, 97 %, and 95 %, respectively.

SETTING AND METHODS Included in the analyses were 1,838 participants aged 65 years and older who were able to walk and with a Mini-Mental State Examination score ≥ 18 and completed the third-year assessment. RESULTS Participants ( N = 1,248 ) completed baseline assessment s of physical and cognitive abilities.  Driving status was ascertained at baseline and annually thereafter... The outcome measures were: Driving status, Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ), 6-minute-walk distance ( 6MWD ), and self-reported mobility. The final model indicated that three significant predictors of driving cessation : older age at baseline ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = 1.12, p <.001 ), days driven per week ( HR = 0.83, p =.05 ).. This systematic review assesses the association between three physical functioning measures : the Short Physical performance Battery, the Timed Up- and -Go test, and the Rapid Pace Walk with driving outcomes. In the present study, we found that driving performance was strongly associated with the number of years driving.. In addition, the 6-month average speed of gait was significantly lower. The study suggests that improving physical functioning may be a future intervention to keep older adults driving safely longer."
29392334," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of a combined hospital plus home exercise programme following surgery for lung cancer is a subject of open debate. Earlier studies of physical exercise of patients with COPD have shown promising results. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) with chest physical therapy ( CPT ) on pulmonary function and quality of life ( QoL ) in patients with lung cancer. PARTICIPANTS Patients were r and omised to receive PR ( strength and endurance training ) versus CPT ( breathing exercises for lung expansion ). Both groups received educational classes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Functional parameters assessed before and after 4 weeks of PR or CPT ( phase 1 ), and pulmonary complications assessed after lung cancer resection ( phase 2 ). RESULTS Twelve patients in the experimental group showed adequate levels of physical activity ( p=.001 ), spirometry, 6-minute Walk Test ( 6MWT ), quality of Life survey, and anxiety and depression scale... The experimental group had 1.3 units ( 95 % CI 0.3 to 2.2 ) ; male/female ratio 73/37. The active group reported more pain after 3 and 6 months and more limitations because of physical problems after 3 months. In the active group, there were no significant differences in peak VO2 at T0, while a significant main effect of time ( F(1, 22 ) = 0.68 ). Patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy showed decreased attendance at training sessions. Conclusion : Rehabilitation did not result in a better QOL. Exercise tolerance improved from baseline to 4 weeks after surgery, while 15 improved in ESWT. The effects of  postoperative exercise interventions  on exercise capacity and the health-related QOL parameters  following resection for non-small cell lung cancer, and to review whether different initiation times of exercise produce different effects on physical capacity."
29762708," BACKGROUND There is promising recent evidence that poverty-targeted cash transfer programs can reduce HIV-infection risk for young women in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there is also reason to believe that such programs can affect other outcomes, such as the sexual behavior of their young beneficiaries. We aim to assess the impact of a conditional cash transfers ( CTs ) on the wider determinants of health in Kenya. An evaluation of the program was implemented in 2007–2009 in seven districts. We used a cluster-r and omised controlled trial in the rural Bushbuckridge subdistrict in Mpumalanga province, South Africa. We included girls aged 13 - 20 years who were enrolled in school grade s 8 - 11, not married or pregnant. The primary outcome variable was an indicator of transactional sex, age-disparate sex, unprotected sex, and other health inequalities. In the poorest quintile, the odds ratio of above 80 % school attendance at follow-up for those with below 20 % school participation at baseline was 1.06 ( p =.67 ) for UCT vs. CCT.. The odds of delivering in a health facility did not differ between groups. Within the field of health promotion, CTs constitute a healthy public policy initiative as they have the potential to address the social determinant of health ( SDoH ) and health inequalities, and to identify the barriers and facilitators of effective CTs."
24633256," BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The risk of major vascular events after an initial episode of atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is a strong, independent risk factor for stroke in older patients with AF. The absolute rate of stroke varies widely among AF patients, importantly influencing the potential benefit of antithrombotic prophylaxis. We examined data from a large contemporary cohort of AF patients to address this question. The role of female gender as a predictor of stroke risk is inconsistent, in particular it is unclear if warfarin treatment is able to prevent stroke equally in both sexes. We performed a prospect i ve study on 780 AF patients on OAT, followed for a mean of 2.0 years. We compared event rates by patient sex using multivariable log-linear regression, adjusting for clinical risk factors for stroke. The mean follow-up was 1.6 years. No difference was found in relation to the quality of anticoagulation between genders ( p=0.5 ). The incidence rate in the age group 55 - 59 years ( RR=2.0, P<0.001 ), systolic blood pressure > 160 mm Hg, and presence of an ischemic lesion on CT scan. These variables could also be used to stratify patients in low-, medium-, and high-risk subgroups for the other two arms of the trial. The original CHADS2 ( Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥75 years, Diabetes, previous Stroke ) score identified the lowest number as high risk ( 27 %, n=180 ). In addition, strokes occurring in females were more disabling, and RR for severe and fatal stroke, defined according to Modified Rankin scale, of females vs. males was 3.1 ( 1.0 % and 1.1 %, respectively ). and-A/R+.)., --}"
30151552," BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate the difference in treatment effect, at 26 and 52 weeks after the start of treatment, between cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) and multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment ( MRT ) for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ). METHODS Participants with a diagnosis of SSc has been recruited and evaluated using different scales before and immediately after NMT application and after one, three and six months. RESULTS Results showed statistical differences between pre and post treatment sessions : the 5 participants with Down syndrome evidence d more reliance on proprioceptive signals in the post-treatment session during the execution of the specific writing tasks. The grade d aerobic training consisted of 20—40 minutes of stationary cycling and treadmill exercise. The progressive resistance training involved 16 exercises performed with single set, moderate load and high repetitions. Main measures : Exercise tolerance ( time to fatigue ) measured on a grade d sub-maximal test, metabolic equivalents and quality of life, along with muscular strength ( maximium push-ups ) and endurance ( sit-to-st and ) and question naires evaluating depressive symptoms and fatigue severity. Results : No intervention was significantly better than the other for any outcome. At 12 months, the intervention did not improve HRQL scores, while fatigue severity and symptoms of depression improved only with aerobic treatment."
31337389," Background We found marked improvement of glycemic control and several cardiovascular risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effects of a Paleolithic diet , as compared to a Mediterranean-like diet. We now report findings on subjective ratings of satiety at meals and data on the satiety hormone leptin and the soluble leptin receptor from the same study. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine two Palaeolithic-type diets ( PAL 1 and PAL 2 ) and a reference diet based on WHO guidelines ( REF ).. The primary outcome was change in fat mass as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Concomitantly, brain activity increased in the anterior part of the right hippocampus during memory encoding, without differences between diets..Conclusion The participants were not taking any cholesterol-lowering medications and adhered to the traditional diet for 6 months ( P<0.001 ) and consumed energy or weight of food and drink for that specific meal... Serum interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) and tumor necrosis factor α levels were decreased at 24 months in both groups ( P < 0.01 for difference between groups ). After 24 months, liver fat decreased 50 % ( 25–75 % ) in both PAL1 ( P= 0.001 and −3.7 vs−2.0 cm, P=0.002 ). Although all formula estimates showed similar and reasonable correlations to anthropometric parameters ( p = 0.004 ), the BMI and waist circumference. The study population as a whole, there was no relationship between change in AUC Glucose0–120 and changes in weight ( r = −0.06 ), waist circumference, through a systematic review with meta- analysis.

The objective is to analyze the influence of two diets on and..A diet. The study was conducted with the objective of testing."
27157250," BACKGROUND Statins are at the forefront of strategies to manage dyslipidemia, but their efficacy in humans are not well known. We performed a r and omized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the effects of metformin, a nonstatin drug that reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption, can reduce the rate of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ). The aim of this study was to assess whether a combination of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 lowers risk of CVD among high-risk women with and without CVD.. The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a nutraceutical-based protocol in elderly hypercholesterolemic patients previously intolerant to statins.. RESULTS : Patients who did not achieve their therapeutic target ( LDL-cholesterol ) and placebo, or 0.8 mg/d for 26 weeks.. Serum adiponectin was increased by metformin, whereas decreased by placebo. The baseline lipid values were : Tot-Chol 255.4 versus 243.1 mg/dL, LDL-Chol 170.1 versus 162.2 mg/ dL, HDL-Chol 50.0 versus 48.8 %, and TG. In conclusion, food supplements containing natural products such as berberine, policosanol, red yeast rice, and astaxanthin could be a useful support to diet and life style changes to correct dyslipidaemia, coronary revascularization, and insulin resistance. The median follow-up time was 6 weeks. The mean time-weighted average LDL cholesterol level during the study was 53.7 mg per deciliter ( 1.4 mmol per liter ) in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group, and 14.5 % for HDL-C.

21791456," BACKGROUND The aim of the study was to assess the effect of a school-based intervention program on cardiovascular disease risk factors in children aged 9 - 11 years. The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. The participants were r and omly assigned to an aerobic exercise training or sedentary control group for 8 weeks. Measurements included peak oxygen uptake ( V o(2)max ), body weight and composition, adipokines ( C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, adiponectin, leptin, and resistin ). RESULTS Seventy-three obese children ( age 14.7 + /- 2.2 years ) were divided into a control group ( studied twice without receiving the intervention ) and an experimental group . The purpose of this paper is to describe the methodology we utilized for implementing a PRT program to avoid publication bias, to study intervention effect and the increase of insulin resistance risk factors. BACKGROUND A number of recent systematic review s have result ed in changes in international recommendations for children's participation in physical activity ( PA ) for health. The World Health Authority ( WHO ) has recently released new recommendations. The WHO still recommends 60 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity  ( MVPA ), but also emphasises that these minutes should be on top of everyday physical activities. The new recommendations total around 30 min of MVPA to the least active children.  Pilates holds promise as a means of reducing obesity, the majority of children. The current recommendations were found to be based on evidence justifying new PA recommendation for children ; the WHO also recommends 30 min per day in total compared with earlier recommendations. CONCLUSIONS To summarise evidence justifying the new recommendations for PA, we think that PA. The world health authorities total 270 min of PA, which means the current recommendations for child health in children.. The 2006 WHO still recommend 60 min/day of PA in children and adolescents..A)."
24314347," BACKGROUND Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) is associated with abnormalities in brain function, this issue has not been examined in a prospect i ve study. The authors sought to determine prospect ively whether psychostimulant treatment for ADHD, the effects of methylphenidate, on brain activation, and on the timing deficits in children with ADHD. : We performed a case-control study in an academic medical center... We used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to examine the neural correlates of the ADHD, compared with placebo, in the daMCC and other frontoparietal regions subserving attention during the Multi- Source Interference Task ( MSIT ). We tested the feasibility of using fMRI. The fMRI data were compared with an age-matched control group of 24 patients who were treated with placebo.. RESULTS Treatment with methylphenidate, ADHD, and placebo showed significant differences bilaterally on cau date volume for both ADHD groups vs controls.. In the fMRI, MPH upregulated the left ventral prefrontal cortex, which correlated with enhanced inhibitory capacity. Compared with controls, both drugs significantly normalized the right ventrolateral prefrontal underactivation observed under placebo, while MPX had a drug-specific effect of normalizing right dorsolateral prefrontal and cerebellar underactivation. The preliminary prediction analysis revealed that the decreased ReHo in right parietal cortex after the acute MPH was positively correlated with the decrease in ADHD symptoms in medication-naïve ADHD adolescents.. The results from this study indicate that an acute dose of MPH normalized all fronto-parieto-cerebellar connectivity. The global ED₅₀ was estimated to be.14 mg/kg, therefore we tested methylpheni date effects relative to placebo in ADHD adolescents with ADHD, with three disorder-relevant tasks in ADHD.A.}-).) "
27150167," Background : To assess whether the effect of educational interventions targeted at primary care physicians ( GPs ) on the management of osteoporosis. We conducted a pragmatic r and omized controlled trial in primary care setting. We tested the effectiveness of a multifaceted community-based care program aimed at improving the quality of care for patients with osteoporotic fractures. Methods The inclusion included a two year cohort study that consisted of five Quality Circle ( QC ) phases that included : 1 ) Training & Baseline Data Collection, 2 ) First Educational Intervention & First Follow-Up Data Collection 3 ) First Strategy Implementation Session. The primary end-point was the level of relief obtained and the secondary changes in prescription of painkilling modalities. RESULTS A total of 155 general practitioners included 772 successive patients. The intervention group received a package of six educational activities tailored to local needs by community planning groups. The number of referrals for both knee and lumbar spine radiographs remained consistently and statistically significantly lower in the intervention group compared to the control group.. The mean difference of 0.94 ( s.e. = 1.01 ). There was no evidence that this difference increased or decreased throughout the 12 month period. CONCLUSIONS The mean treatment rates ( adjusted for age and initial treatment ) increased significantly after both MIN and INT. Only the INT intervention significantly increased the rate of treatment of patients with previous fractures. The majority of patients in group 2 ( 30.3 % of women and 19.0 % of men, both p < 0.001 ). The median times until medication discontinuation for patients and treatment outcomes were not significantly different. BACKGROUND Musculoskeletal conditions require particular management skills. Identification of interventions which are effective in equipping general practitioners  with the necessary skills could translate to improved healthcare and societal costs."
29858467," Background. Physical activity is important for health and well-being.  γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic activity is reduced in elderly patients.. The authors conducted a prospect i ve controlled trial. The study included 49,821 US women aged between 18 and 65 years with moderate to high levels of perceived psychological distress were included in the study. The intervention was implemented on three equidistant occasions ( baseline, 6 and 12 months ). The outcome measures were the self-report depression, anxiety, and stress scale ( DASS-21 ). We measured the difference to baseline on Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale ( CPSS ). There were no significant group differences at baseline on these demographic indicators or esteem variables. Data were analyzed using linear and parallel process growth modeling procedures. Results. The walking and yoga interventions failed to enhance global or physical self-esteem, but improved subdomain esteem relative to physical condition and strength ( for walking ) and body attractiveness. The treatment group ( n = 19 ) had significantly greater improvement in mood and greater decreases in anxiety than the walking group. The multivariate relative risk comparing the highest level of PA  ( ≥ 90 minutes/day ) with the lowest ( < 10 minutes/ day ) was 0.80 ( 95 % confidence interval : 0.70, 0.92 ; P =.004 ). In contrast, the risk of depression increased with increasing television-watching time. The positive effects of walking have well-established positive relationships with, and effects on, physical health. We aim to scope the literature and present what is known, and highlight what is not known."

This prospect i ve cohort study was to examine whether the type of anaesthesia ( general or regional ) plays a role in the development of postoperative complications. We designed a prospective cohort study to determine whether geriatric patients > /= 60 years of age who underwent thoracic surgery  were registered prospect ively and examined. A comprehensive geriatric assessment ( CGA ) that evaluated such diverse areas as functional status ( ie, performance status and activities of daily living [ ADLs ] using the Barthel index ), the patients underwent surgery. The cohort was dichotomized on the basis of median frailty score into frail and not frail groups. The incidence of delirium was also examined during the same period with the use of DSM III criteria. RESULTS : Overall, among the elderly patients, the mean Barthel score was higher than the non-delirious patients ( 27 vs. 28, P = 0.026 ). The majority of patients had a postoperative complication. Postoperative delirium occurred in 45.3 per cent at 1 month, 30.1 % at 3 months, and 28.3 % at 1 year. The rate of adherence to recommendations made by the GTCS team was 93.2 %. The older group had a longer hospital stay for both THR ( 5.9 versus 9.0 days, p < 0.0001 ) and the postoperative delirium ( 6.2 versus 8.3 days ).. The rates of post-operative complications and mortality were not significantly different between the intervention and control group.

25691348," The purpose of this study was to conduct an assessment of binge eating severity among obese persons. The present report describes the preliminary testing and refinement of the Master Question naire ( MQ ), a true-false scale developed expressly for use in obesity research. The total sample was initially divided into four subscales : Spouse Support, Energy Balance Habits, Cognitive Factors, and Energy Balance Knowledge. In addition to weight loss and LOC over eating, the assessment s targeted eating disorder psychopathology, depression levels, and quality of life. The study was conducted between January 2002 and February 2008.. Test-retest reliability and sensitivity to treatment-related change were each found to be acceptable for three out of four subscales. The YFAS exhibited adequate internal reliability, and showed good convergent validity with measures of similar constructs and good discriminant validity relative to related but dissimilar constructs. Significant correlation between the scales were obtained such that severe bingers tended to set up diets which were unrealistically strict while reporting low efficacy expectations to sustain a diet. The obtained three-factor structure was cross-vali date d and replicated across subgroups by gender, age and BMI. The original TFEQ factor structure was not replicated. A short, revised 18-item instrument was constructed, representing the derived factors of Cognitive Restraint, Uncontrolled Eating and Emotional Eating."

Conclusion Our results indicate that the majority of patients with a deviated-type syrinx on pre- and postoperative MRI tended to be associated with more intense pain than the other two types. The majority of participants who underwent posterior fossa surgery for the Chiari I malformations reported significant improvement in their clinical outcomes... Conclusion Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I ) is a common and often debilitating neurological disease. Efforts to improve the clinical outcomes are impeded by inconsistent and limited methods of evaluating the surgical outcomes. and.)."
24146670," PURPOSE The aim of this study was to compare the effect of mineral trioxide aggregate ( MTA ) to that of formocresol ( FC ) as pulp dressing agents in pulpotomy in primary molars with carious pulp exposure. The success rate among 142 vital teeth was 99.3 % and among 33 non-vital teams 84.8 %. There was no significant effect upon age at exfoliation after either type of pulpal treatment. In the MTA ( experimental ) or FC ( control ) group, pulp stumps were covered with zinc-oxide eugenol paste. Permanent restorations were stainless steel crowns. This is a systematic review of literature comparing the success rates of MTA and FC in pulp cauterization.. Twenty-nine tooth were followed until uneventful shedding ( mean=33 months ). The crowns in both groups were restored with amalgam or glass ionomer.  The treatment success rate of both groups was 97 % for MTA ( 1 failure ) and 83 % for FC. It was concluded that MTA treated molars demonstrated significantly greater success.  MTA seems to be a suitable replacement for formocol in pulpectomized primary tooth through the 3-month follow-up. However, at the 6-month postoperative evaluation, significantly more cases ( P = 0.036 ) with root resorption were seen in the FC group. This finding was detected in 2 out of the 15 ( 13 % ) treated with FC.. The remaining 53 treatment cases appeared to have clinical ly and radiographically successful 6 months postoperatively.. Pulp canal obliteration was a radiographic finding in 11 treatment with MTA and 1 tooth ( FC."

A secondary measure was time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ). A Fourier series analysis was applied to study in detail patterns over time. Results : Activity profiles throughout the year were unique for each sex, with boys being overall more active than girls ( 65 ± 36 versus 54 ± 28 steps/min ). In both genders higher step counts per minute were significantly associated with less children per m2 and with shorter recess times. Only in boys a hard playground surface was a borderline significant predictor for higher physical activity levels.Conclusion : Children were active for 67 % ( mean 568.5 SD 79.5 minutes ) of their daily registered time on average. The positive association with size of indoor area per child and location of the preschool building on the playground. There were no differences in children ’s average daily levels of sedentary activity and LPA by temporal and demographic factors. Identifying correlates and determinants of PA during the early years ( age 0 - 6 years ) is crucial to guide effective interventions."
20969769," BACKGROUND Although osteoporosis is common in older adults, it is often under-diagnosed and under-treated. We conducted a double-blind study of a large sample of postmenopausal women attending to a primary care physicians. We developed a model to determine the effect of a mailed educational intervention on the risk of fracture. The study population included older adults who were enrolled in a state-run pharmacy benefits program ( The Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly in Pennsylvania ). The patients were r and omized to receive oral alendronate 10 mg ( n = 950 ) or placebo. This sequence was repeated 10 times, for a total of 150 weeks. RESULTS Patient-specific clinical guideline advice to the primary care provider delivered by electronic medical record ( EMR ) was compared with usual care. The main outcome measures were the percent changes in lumbar-spine, hip, and total-body bone mineral density. The physician intervention included one-on-one academic detailing encounters covering the same topics. The primary endpoint, were defined as a decrease of 20 % ( and at least 4 mm ) in the femoral neck, 3.6 % ( 3.2 % to 4.1 % ) at the trochanter and 3.0 % ( P<0.001. The effect of the intervention on knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy ( confidence in one ’s ability to perform specific activities ).. The prevalence of all types of fractures. The incidence of hip fracture was significantly higher in patients who received alendronate than the placebo group. The fracture was a strong indicator of osteoporotic, it offers an ideal opportunity to initiate screening and treatment. The overall incidence of fracture was low, the fracture was not significantly different between the study groups. The screening and/or treatment of bone mineral Density, and only 40 % were ever told they were on this incongruity in current practice."
14670881," OBJECTIVE : The objective of this prospect i ve study was to compare the effectiveness of three different physiotherapy masks on the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications after cardiac surgery. The techniques examined were taught self supported huffing and coughing by a physiotherapist and encouraged to move about. The patients were treated with routine chest physiotherapy alone or supplied with either positive expiratory pressure ( PEP ), or inspiratory resistance-positive expirative pressure ( IR-PEP ). RESULTS : None of the patients were included in the study. The results showed that the absence of any complication predicted a lower average charge, and postoperative death ( 4.4 + /- 4.5 days after surgery ). The charts of all 116 patients identified by the registry as having complications and 412 ( 19 % ) patients were reviewed and omly selected from 2,175 remaining patients. There were no significant differences between the three groups. Mean FRC on day 2 was 1.90 litres ( p = 0.01 ), increasing to 2.32 1 by day 5. The mean arterial oxygen tension was not significantly different from the other two groups."
25754617," The effect of oral hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) is associated with low cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in postmenopausal women.. No statistically significant changes were found in the blood lipids when comparing the patients treated with  oestradiol , 1 mg, and placebo. The study was to determine the effect of HRT on the incidence of all strokes, stroke deaths, and venous thromboembolic events. Results : The study included women with a history of menopause. The main endpoint was any new breast cancer event. All analyses were done according to intention-to-treat.. Women were r and omized to one of four groups : conjugated estrogens ( 0.625 mg, daily ) to women without a uterus ( placebo ) or 0.3 mg ( L-HRT ).. During an average follow-up of 7.1 years, there were 168 women who developed thrombosis, but not on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels... For all women the HRT group and the placebo group had similar to baseline.. The incidence of VTE was 10.7 % ( n = 434 ) of participants who received treatment, and 6.3 % of women were taken to placebo.. In women assigned to the combined HRT group, they were 1.37 ( 1.09 to 1.73 ). In the postmenopausal women treated, the HRs were similar in all categories of baseline stroke risk, including younger and more recently menopausal women and in women with prior or current use of statins or aspirin. The results also support those of recent epidemiological studies, which also indicate increased risk of VTE in non-selected postmenopausal women, the effects of CEE treatment in primary or secondary prevention. The outcomes of the study were: ( i ) assess the impact of time since menopause that treatment was commenced ( P<0.001 ), andA.-). .

20715299," BACKGROUND Although depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, treatment often falls short of evidence -based recommendations.. We examine the incremental cost-effectiveness of 2 quality improvement ( QI ) interventions to improve treatment of depression in primary care. The authors' primary objectives in this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of citalopram, an antidepressant, using measurement-based care in actual practice. Three months later, patients were contacted and interviewed to determine antidepressant usage and the side effects experienced, including when these were experienced and their severity. RESULTS : Between October 2001 and April 2003, 406 English- or Spanish-speaking patients aged 18 to 75 years were followed up. The overall remission rate defined as a Montgomery – Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score of nine or less was 68 % in the ITT sample analysed with the last observation carried forward ( LOCF ) technique, and 75 % in observed cases. The primary outcome was adherence as measured by the medication possession ratio and measurement as specified by HEDIS. The adjusted annual cost estimates were compared to those assigned to interpersonal psychotherapy. Of the patients studied 37 % had an adherence of less than 70 %. The total annual cost of depression treatment was estimated at $ 118 billion ( 95 % CI=12.3–22.2 ). The incremental direct cost per additional depression-free day for pharmacotherapy vs. usual care ranges from $ 12.66 to $ 16.87, the intervention variable stood alone in its significant impact on adherence ( P =.35 ) and $ 485 ( 13 % ). This suggests that the economic and human costs of depression may be lower than that of many other widely accepted medical interventions. The economic and clinical outcomes of depression are similar and that may be related to depression through the use of enhanced-care programs."
24306266," This study investigated the physical and psychosocial consequences of living with osteoarthritis ( OA ) of 61 patients over 60 years of age.  Models were elicited using a structured interview. Shared beliefs included perceiving OA as a serious, painful, chronic, and incurable condition that can be managed by recommended medical treatment. Considerable individual differences were found on six personal-model constructs : Symptoms, Seriousness, Cause, Control, Helpfulness of Treatment, and Negative Feelings about Treatment. The constructs of Symptoms and Seriousness were consistently related to a variety of important outcomes. For example, participants with higher scores on Symptoms and Severeness reported higher levels of self-management ( both concurrently and prospect ively ), reported more utilization of medical services, and experienced a poorer quality of life. The implication s for the design of health-education material s and for patient-provider interactions are discussed. The study was nested within a pragmatic r and omised controlled trial.  The findings showed that expectations of TKA were linked to participants ’ knowledge of the procedure and its outcomes. The participants listed acquaintances, friends, family members, and doctors as the main sources of knowledge for TKA. On the basis of this study, recommendations are made for developing a preoperative physiotherapy program that would focus on minimizing preoperative disability and maximizing postoperative recovery."
31073341," Background To determine whether a home-based physical activity intervention can increase physical activity levels in older adults. The study aim was to assess the feasibility of a pedometer-based walking programme in those with impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ). Method A 12-week r and omized controlled trial was conducted with participants aged 65 and above. The intervention group ( n = 51 ),  pedometer only ( PED, n = 62 ). The primary outcome was patients ’ walking time measured by  accelerometers  during the rehabilitation admission.  Walking times from accelerometry were made available daily to treating therapists and intervention participants to motivate patients to improve incidental activity levels and reach set goals. For the control group, ‘ usual care » was followed, including the setting of mobility goals.. The outcome measures were global cognitive function, memory function, executive function, and brain activation ( measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging ). RESULTS The study showed that the intervention group had significantly greater postintervention improvement in memory and executive functions. The effect of physical activity monitor-based interventions on the study outcomes was unclear and should be systematic ally review ed. The group received a higher step count at 12 weeks than the placebo group. The main outcome was change from baseline to 8 weeks in accelerometer‐measured daily time expending at least 3 METs. At 12 months, the mean ( 95 % CI ) : 24.6 ( 21.7, 27.4 ). There were no significant changes in the secondary outcomes. The improvement in physical activity monitors  was associated with the effect on body mass index, physical capacity, and health-related quality of life.. Conclusion The study suggests that a pragmatic structured education program that incorporates pedometer use is effective for improving physical activity behavior  in adults with moderate to severe obesity. Controlled trials targeting older adults and of a higher dose may be feasible and may be applied to.-.). The effect on physical activity monitoring  in healthy older adults is unclear ) and the impact on health outcomes."
23235671," The present report examines the efficacy of trazodone, amitriptyline, and placebo in a double-blind study performed at three clinical research units in the U.S.A.. RESULTS : In the placebo group, the majority of patients were found to be responders, but not to placebo. The total score on the Hamilton depression scale and a global rating of depression showed that all 3 active treatments were more effective than placebo. At the beginning of the investigations, there was no significant difference between drug therapy alone and placebo throughout the remaining 3 weeks. In most efficacy comparisons.. The combination was as good as, or better than, amitryptyline.. Although an immunological mechanism can not be ruled out, several characteristics of this reaction suggest the formation of a tricyclic antidepressant in adults, but is still regularly used.. It has also been frequently used as an active comparator in trials on newer antidepressants and can therefore be called a'benchmark'antidepressant. However, its efficacy and safety vs. placebo in treating major depression has not been assessed in a systematic review and meta- analysis."
28635182," Background Dietary fibers have been investigated as a rich source of n-3 fatty acids ( FAs ), which mainly produce a non-atherogenic lipid profile. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of diets enriched with high-oleic canola oil ( HOCO ), alone or blended with flaxseed oil ( FXCO ), on the lipid profiles of healthy young men. One hundred and ninety-nine subjects ( 22 men and 24 women ) completed two 3-wk treatment periods in a r and omized, crossover trial. The intervention groups received diets that contributed approximately 20 g fiber/d from either flaxseed ( approximately 50 g ALA/day ) or wheat bran ( control ), while they consumed self-selected National Cholesterol Education Program Step II diets.. The dietary intake of saturated fat was subdivided into low ( < 7 % SFA/day of the total energy value ) and high consumption groups ( > 7 % FA / day ). Blood sample s were collected at baseline and at the end of each period. Results Total cholesterol ( TC ) and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol decreased significantly in the LA and ALA groups ( LA : P ≤ 0.01, ALA : P = 0.05 ). No significant changes in body composition measures were observed between diets. However, the and roid-to-gynoid ratio tended to increase ( P < 0.055 ). The consumption of either 2.4 or 3.6 g flaxseed oil/d ( in capsules ) was sufficient to significantly increase plasma total and LDL-cholesterol and increased fat excretion, but the food matrix and /or processing may be of importance.... The present study aim ed to systematic ally review and analyse RCTs assessing the impacts of flaxseed consumption on body weight and/or obesity."
31768318," BACKGROUND We evaluated the effectiveness of transcutaneous electrical stimulation ( TES ) to treat overactive bladder ( OAB ) and urinary incontinence in children. This pilot study assessed whether daily TES at home with a safe, portable machine would be possible and more efficacious than trial results. MATERIAL AND METHODS Eleven patients ( 6 male/5 female ; mean age, 14 years ; range, 12 - 18 years ) with slow-transit constipation who relapsed or responded poorly in the trial were recruited ( 11 + /- 5 months later ). An EPM-IF-4160 ( Fuji Dynamics, Hong Kong ) portable machine ( sine waveform, 4 kHz carrier frequency, 80 - 160 Hz beat frequency, intensity <33 mA ). RESULTS A total of 13 and 15 patients were r and omized to groups 1 and 2, respectively. Symptoms completely resolved in 6 patients in group 1 ( 46 % ) and 3 in group 2 ( 20 % ). After completion of the 20 sessions controls who were not cured underwent active treatment. The number of voiding frequency per day was chosen as primary efficacy parameter. There was a significant increase in total episodes of defecation per week ( 57 vs. 60 % ; p = 0.07 ). Among the 16 children with OAB, no parent reported cure. In the sham group no patient reported cure ( p < 0.001 ). Of the 19 patients who reported disturbed voiding frequency of less than 4 or more than 8 voids daily. All efficacy variables decreased in those with previous treatment, but with no difference between the st and ard and the placebo group. The only difference noted was when comparing the children with NUGM, which was significantly greater than in children with UGD."
28941967," BACKGROUND To evaluate the effect of 2 different postoperative therapy approaches on the rehabilitation of patients with distal radius fractures. The control group was treated for 5 weeks in conventional short-arm, below the elbow plaster of Paris. The other group was assigned to two groups 10 - 12 days after the injury. The group was compared with those of conventional three-week immobilization, the other group consisted of 16 patients who received rehabilitation  with the same rehabilitation protocol. At 5 weeks, 3 and 9 months we measured the functional scores. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups at any time. The greatest improvement in function was shown in the patients who were treated conventionally. The secondary outcomes were the Constant score at six weeks and at six months. The primary outcome measure ( PRWHE ) and secondary outcome measures, total arc of motion for wrist flexion and extension, supination and pronation, and grip strength. RESULTS After a 6-week period of postoperative treatment. The patients ( n=23 ) performing an independent home exercise program using a training diary showed a significantly greater improvement of the knee flexion. The main outcome measure was the percentage of patients who achieved a satisfactory level of function. The study also showed that the combined exercise programs may not be effective in reducing impairments and improving activity during upper limb fractures."
24862702," The objective of this study was to determine whether the use of an electronic apex locator results in a reduction in X-ray exposure during endodontic therapy. The purpose of the clinical study was 1) to compare the effect of working length determination using electronic apex locus or working length radiograph on the length adequacy of final working length as well as the final obturation. The results indicated that a higher percentage of acceptable measurements were obtained by the radiographic method as compared with the electronic method ( 88.5 % to 73.1 % ). Additionally, the teeth were sectioned and the actual working length measured for comparison. For group A, 14 retake radiographs were required to establish the working length, whereas group B required no retake radiograms. Once treatment was completed, then the average length of each canal was counted. The number of cases with acceptable ( 33.3 % ) and with unacceptable ( 10.4 % ) to the apex was also blindly registered. An electronic estimate of  the WL improved length quality of tissue. The average position for the auto apical reverse function was preset on to be the apical foramen. The group II that was treated with a mean distance from the root canal filling to radiography, but not in molars. The ENDEX, unlike the RCM Mark II, proved accurate in the presence of sodium hypochlorite. The measurements were made twice by two different investigators. The most used, however, the mean distance between the canal wall and apex was not accurate. Despite being the most used. Although it is proposed to have the highest accuracy, this method is not perfect. The electronic apex calculators were coincident to each other and to a greater extent than the conventional radiograography. The Electronic apex locators have been presented as an alternative to  the classic method of treating..Apical constriction. The root canal system can detect the periodontal transition and therefore, may perform with improved accuracy."
22071397," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the prevalence of overweight and obesity in an adolescent group representative of a rural Mediterranean area and to determine possible associations with energy and nutrient intakes and levels of physical exercise. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES Participants were 1015 girls ( mean age, 14.6 years ; 45 % African-American ) from 12 high schools in South Carolina who served as control subjects for a school-based intervention.  Post-intervention measures obtained at the end of ninth grade were used. PA was measured using the Three-Day PA Recall, and a question naire measured social-cognitive and environmental variables thought to mediate PA. Height and weight were measured, and BMI was calculated. RESULTS For girls, participation in community sports, self-efficacy in overcoming barriers, enjoyment of school physical education, race ( white > black ), and perception of mother's activity level ( active vs inactive ) were significant predictors of VPA. For  MVPA, children in the soccer group had significant decreases in body mass index z scores at 3 and 6 months and significant increases in total daily, moderate, and vigorous physical activity at 3 months. CONCLUSION An after-school team soccer program for overweight children can be a feasible, acceptable, and efficacious intervention for weight control. The change in energy intake associated with an hour change in physical activity is 292 kcal h−1 ( 95 % CI : 262–321 kcal day−1 ). No significant change is associated with reading/doing homework. Assuming that typical energy expenditures are associated with these behaviors, reading/playing homework appears to be an ‘ energy neutral ’ activity, whereas watching TV and playing video and computer games is associated to an energy surplus.. The differential impacts of the adolescent population studied ( 48.2 % in boys and 30.7 % in girls )."
23369854," BACKGROUND To evaluate the utility of intrathoracic impedance monitoring (. ) to predict clinical deterioration of heart failure ( HF ). The authors developed a remote monitoring program as part of HF management and prospect ively examined the feasibility and re source utilization of monitoring individuals with an implanted device capable of measuring Z. METHODS The authors used logistic regression to study the effects of telemonitoring on health services utilization and mortality.. The primary endpoint was the positive predictive value ( PPV ) at 12 months. Secondary endpoints were a correlation between onset of HF and IIM, optimal threshold of fluid index and duration between the alert and HF. Complete follow-up clinical data were obtained from 111 patients. During the observational period, 168 patients ( 47 % ) were associated with a CE within 2 weeks of the Z event. In another 71 ( 20 % ) Z events, the patient therapy was adjusted despite the absence of overt signs of clinicalioration. The rate of unexplained Z events was 0.25 per patient-year and in 33 patients ( 20 percent ) in the control arm ( P=0.063 ). The overall incidence of HF hospitalization for the intervention group compared with controls was 0 ( 0.62 ).. A total of 233 patients were identified as having HF. The number of admissions, hospital days, and hospital costs were significantly lower during the first 6 months after intervention. The integration of data obtained from implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and cardiac-resynchronization therap devices. CONCLUSIONS The device reliably detected HF, and yielded low rates of readmission rates and improved patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS This review will synthesize the literature regarding the efficacy of device diagnostic data to treat late indicators of decompensated HF."
28447854," OBJECTIVE To examine whether the effectiveness of dietary restraint scales predict future increases in body mass and whether polymorphisms in DRD2 and DRD4 moderate these relations. DESIGN AND RESULTS Women between age 30 and 50 ( N = 255 ) participated in a 24-month r and omized controlled trial comparing two brief interventions. The authors previously found that  dietary restraint  scales were not inversely correlated with objective measures of short-term caloric intake. The objective was to systematic ally review social cognitive theory-based studies of FVI and to identify its main psychosocial determinants. RESULTS The conditioning intervention made implicit attitudes toward energy-dense snacks more negative, while children low in Reward Sensitivity were more willing to taste when verbally encouraged, but with hesitation. This article thus highlights the roles of both individual differences and behavioral techniques for promoting a healthy diet. More than a quarter agreed with the statement that eating low-fat foods takes the pleasure out of eating. CONCLUSIONS To discuss healthy diet from a psychological perspective by considering definitions of healthy diet in terms of the healthy diet and ( chronic ) illness. The majority of participants in this study had a positive attitude to healthy diet, outperforming all other variables in explaining healthy snack intake.. The findings demonstrate that snacking habits provide a unique contribution in explaining unhealthy snacking behaviour, emphasizing the importance of addressing habit strength in future research and interventions concerning unhealthy diet."
24749160," Abstract Rationale : Modafinil, a novel wake-promoting agent, has been shown to have a similar clinical profile to that of conventional stimulants. The present study investigated the effects of the stimulating drugs modafinil ( 300 mg ) and d-amphetamine ( 20 mg ) on the ability to self-monitor cognitive performance during 64 h of sleep deprivation ( SD ) and sustained mental work. The study examined effects in 13 measures of cognitive ability including episodic memory, working memory, inhibitory control, and a complex mental addition task. The authors propose that the ERN is generated when the drug is at least moderately enhancing ( Cohen's d > =.5 ) to some or all cognitive abilities tested, ( 2 ) whether its effects on cognition are moderated by baseline ability or COMT genotype, and ( 3 ) whether it induces an illusory perception of cognitive enhancement. The results did not reveal enhancement of any cognitive abilities by MAS. The majority of participants were r and omly assigned to an experimental condition and orally ingested what they believed to be MPH, though actually placebo. The most frequently cited motive for abuse is improved academic achievement, the dose for optimal performance varying with the level of complexity. The latency of P300 is increased by the placebo, regardless of whether subjects actually received AMP or placebo. Our aim in review is to identify neurocognitive effects of prescription stimulants in non-ADHD youth."
27997982," This in vitro study evaluated the effect of two bleaching agents to enamel surface morphology. The effect of home bleaching treatment with 10 % carbamide peroxide on the microhardness of enamel. The crowns of 60 extracted intact human teeth were sectioned longitudinally ; the buccal part was embedded in acrylic resin. The specimens were r and omly divided into two groups and su bmi tted to a single 45-minute in-office bleaching session with 35 % CP, 60 sound dentin fragments ( SD ) and 60 demineralized dentin fragments. The first group was trimmed with a fine diamond bur to reduce the bony surface of the maxillary right central incisors. In the second group, the specimens were immersed in distilled water as control group.  Longitudinal sections were made using diamond disks ( 0.2 mm ) under water lubrication to obtain enamel slabs measuring ( 3 mm x 3 mm ). The slabs were embedded in polystyrene resin for 30 min subsequent to bleaching.. The enamel surface Knoop microhardness ( KHN ) was measured at baseline, after bleaching, and after the bleaching therapies ( p < 0.05 ). RESULTS Results showed no statistical significant differences between the enamel microhardness of different groups ( p = 0.051 ). There were no significant differences in microhardness values among the groups in enamel surface were observed in the study. The bleaching agents used in this study showed no significant difference in enamel microhardness that may affect dental health in terms of resistance to masticatory forces. This meta- analysis was performed in order to determine scientific evidence regarding the effects of home vital bleaching on dental tissues. The evaluation of this article shows that enamel microhardness was not affected by bleaching. The study showed that there was no significant effect of oral bleaching with 10 percent carbamide peride. The evaluated tissue microhardness was important for assessing alterations in enamel hardness that could affect dental integrity in those and.)."
26655787," BACKGROUND To assess the effect of a collaborative lifestyle intervention on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) and whether there is a differential response to higher versus lower carbohydrate intake. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a r and omized controlled trial at two university medical centers in Hong Kong. Patients in the intervention group had regular exercise sessions with structured patient ( DIET ), or usual care by own health professional ( n=95 ). The others received the same medical care except no nursing reinforcement ( control group ). Outcome measures included fasting plasma glucose, HbA(1c ), body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure and lipid profiles, which were assessed before the study and after 1 year. RESULTS Mean ( SD ) age and diabetes duration of participants were 61.5 ( 10.5 ) and 11.5 ± 9.3 ) years, respectively. At the end of study, the group had reduced HbA1c ( 7.1 % vs. 9.2 % ; P < 0.001 ). Mean fitness increased in ILI. The intervention groups had reduced their total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In comparison with baseline and control group, exercise-treated patients improved glucose control, lipid profile, exercise capacity ( Vo2 peak ) and exhibited decreased insulin resistance and systolic BP considerably ( P <.05 ). Plasma adiponectin, TNF-α and body weight changed slightly across treatment ( P > 0.05 ), whereas diastolic BP and fat mass tended to decrease ( P = 0.071 and 0.061, respectively ). CONCLUSIONS The current meta- analysis evaluated the outcomes of various lifestyle interventions, including diet modifications, physical activity ( PA ), and patient education ( EDU ) in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with type II diabetes. The type of patients targeted for intervention, including nutrition and exercise, and the outcome of the.+."
17356688," The purpose of this study was to compare three different modes of treatment in toddlers with epilepsy. We undertook a r and omized study to assess the efficacy of intramuscular phenobarbital ( PB ), and valproate ( VPA ). The two groups were matched for sex, age at the time of testing, and type of epilepsy. The patients included in the study had shown their first generalized convulsive seizure during a bout of fever ( greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees C ) and were aged between 6 months and 4 years. There were no significant differences in total seizure control with PBZ, but this was not statistically significant. Although individual children in each group had changes in behavior or cognitive status, neither group changed significantly, in either acute or chronic follow-up. The overall rate of recurrence was independent of the prophylactic and therapy, but a subset of children in both groups had new febrile convulsions.

30690935," The neuropeptide oxytocin ( OT ) is an important treatment for a number of psychiatric disorders and involves a unique form of human attachment. The authors tested the effect of OT on anxiety and depression. The study that has focused on the role of OT. In Study 1, 1,486 participants from 62 countries accessed the authors'on-line experiment to the Internet. They were asked to use the same type of emotional stimuli, the effects on social cognition, and indicated decrements in phobic responding from pretest to posttest following cognitive therapy.. The aim of this study was to investigate whether intranasal OT ( IN-OT ) affects the processing of positive and negative affective stimuli. In a r and omized, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. The results suggest that OT administration improved the performance of the emotional stimuli. The present systematic review aim to summarize the evidence for OT. The positive effects of OT in the field of anxiety. In addition, the study suggests that OXT may modulate the neural mechanisms by which OT modulates complex social and cognitive behaviours. The current study demonstrates that the administration of OT improves social cognition (. ) in response to emotional stimuli as well as the negative ones. The findings suggest the potential of OT to enhance the understanding of anxiety and depressive disorders. The future studies should explore the neuromodulating function of OT, in addition to its potential role in treating anxiety disorders."
24300225," OBJECTIVES To investigate the views of participants in a r and omized controlled trial of physical treatments for low back pain ( LBP ) over the subsequent 6 months. To date, no studies have used longitudinal pain recordings to examine the “ natural ” course of recurrent and chronic LBP in a population ‐based sample of individuals. This study examines the course of LBP in the general population and elaborates on the stability and criterion‐related validity of the clusters derived. RESULTS We received a total of 1259 comments from 1334 participants. The responders could be divided into 3 groups with regard to LBP : no pain, short-term pain, and long-lasting/recurring pain. The latter were analyzed using LCA. 305 individuals returned more than 50 % of their diaries. Only 1.0 % ( 95 % CI, 0.0%–2.2 % ) developed intense and 0.4 % were pain free in year 5. A qualitative focus group study of exercise instructor feedback about the exercise preferences instrument will be embedded in this research design. Three of  the four clusters describing the typical course of pain matched the outcomes described previously for patients in primary care. Due to the population ‘based design, this study achieves, for the first time, a close insight into the `` natural “ course of chronic and recurrent low back Pain... The two main factors directly associated with clinicians to prescribe the appropriate interventions. The findings will help to underst and better the nature of this pain in those who seek to improve their own health. The global burden of low back back pain is the highest ranked condition contributing to years of living with disability. Exercise is moderately effective, and adherence to exercise may improve if participants are engaged. Identification of elements that enhance engagement would enable clinicians the use of appropriate interventions."
17258623," The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the sealing ability of two contemporary  endodontic obturation techniques ( Trifecta, Hygenic Corp., OH. The study was conducted to assess the effect of the smear layer on retention of bacteria using the fluid filtration method. Thirty-six single-rooted teeth were prepared. The root canals were prepared with 5.25 % NaOCl ( smear layer intact ), whereas the other group was flushed with 17 % EDTA and 5.5 % NaOCl. The teams were divided into two groups of ten tooth each : in Group 1, Scotchbond Multi- Purpose Plus was applied in combination with Z-100 following the manufacturer's instructions. In Group 2, the root canal preparations were irrigated with 15 % EDTA for 20 s and those in Group 2 preparations were lased with Nd : YAG laser at 3.2 W. The specimens were left in 100 % humidity for 14 days. The mean contraction gap was recorded and compared between groups. The canal walls were filled with three layers of nail varnish on all of their surfaces apart from the apical 4.0 mm and the coronal area above the cemento-enamel junction. The presence of a smear layer was measured immediately, after 24 h, 1 week and 1 month.

22895954," The trial entitled ""The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program ( SHEP ) is a r and omized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to determine if antihypertensive treatment of isolated systolic hypertension ( ISH ), with mild hypertension, with or without cardiovascular disease, reduces the incidence of mortality and morbidity. The study began in 1972 and ended in 2007. The study was designed to investigate the differences of mean systolic and diastolic pressure achieved between treated and untreated subjects. The statistical method used in this study was conditional power ( or stochastic curtailment ). The findings did not become conclusive until near the completion of the trial. A total of 95 percent of patients with hypertension, aged 50 - 80 years ( mean 61.5 years ) with the systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) and diastolic blood pressure, had their medication tapered and discontinued, and then met BP criteria. The model predicts a substantial decrease in blood pressure. The number of deaths and the duration of hospital stay were not significant. The benefits and harms of treating mild hypertension in primary prevention patients are not known at present. This review examines the existing evidence.. The primary prevention population was found to have a low baseline total and diastolic BP, the mortality rate was not significantly different between the 2 groups. In the study, the mean age was 29.6 years and there were no adverse effects on the fall in serum potassium level. This study included the following: ( 1 ) The benefits of treatment for hypertension. The adverse effects of hypertension, both on mortality and total mortality, in those with primary prevention treatment, were not known in these analyses.

We investigated the acute effect of coffee ingestion on the peripheral vascular system, which may influence endothelial function, both of which have not yet been investigated. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of caffeine ( 250 mg ) on brachial artery FMD, and arterial stiffness ( AS ). : A total of 15 ( 8 men and 7 women ) healthy nonobese subjects underwent a single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study.. The subjects were 20 healthy males with reduced vasodilation responses measured by strain gauge plethysmograms ( SPG ) to ischemic reactive hyperemia. Of the 20 subjects, 10 ( mean age, 37.2 years ) ingested a test drink containing caffeine ( CQA : 140 mg/day ), and the other 10 (mean age, 34.8 years ). The placebo group showed a significant increase in radial and aortic systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure, respectively.. Men given caffeine versus placebo showed the expected elevation in vascular resistance ( P < 0.001 ) and P<0.05 ). At baseline, FMD, but not NTG, was significantly lower in patients with CAD compared to controls. The AIx was significantly decreased after ingestion of the test beverage, and was significantly higher ( P = 0.004 ) than that in the placebo group. The change in EF, the ratio of EF, and AS were significantly higher following coffee intake than after placebo.

We aim to investigate whether a reduction in body weight by dietary interventions could improve episodic memory performance and alter associated functional brain responses. We tested the effect of a PD on anthropometric measurements and metabolic balance in obese postmenopausal women. Seventy healthy postmenopausal women were r and omized to either a PD or a control diet ( CD ) for 24 months. Blood sample s and fat biopsies  were collected at baseline, 6 months, and 24 months to analyze inflammation-related parameters. RESULTS And roid fat decreased significantly more in the PD group ( P = 0.009 ) during the first 6 months with weight maintenance at 24 months in both groups. The ND was rich in high-fibre plant foods, fruits, berries, vegetables, whole grains, and a Nordic Nutrition Recommendation ( NNR ).. This was associated with decreased levels of plasma free fatty acids ( FFA ). The primary endpoint was the weight change analyzed by both completer and intention-to-treat analyses... After 12 months, brain activity decreased in inferior and middle frontal gyri ( P < 0.001 ). Despite the observation that low levels of physical activity are a major cause of obesity ( NND ), the mean weight loss was not thought to be a useful strategy for obesity prevention. The mean ( ±SEM ) weight change was -4.7 ± 0.5 kg for the NND compared with -1.5 ± 1.1 kg ( P= 0.01 ), and the difference between groups ( 6 months ).

The purpose of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to ( 1 ) characterize acute post-Concussion ( 0–3 days ) RT impairments, (2 ) examine acute RT recovery ( 0.49 ± 0.09 ) and ( 3 ) explore moderating factors related to acute RT impairment following concussion."
17526675," The study aim ed to investigate the relationship between skeletal muscle, fibre type composition, functional respiratory impairment and exercise tolerance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ). It has been hypothesized that the physiological role of UCP3 is to protect mitochondria against lipotoxicity in cases where fatty acid influx exceeds the capacity to oxidize them. In COPD patients, vital capacity ( VC ) and forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV1 ) were reduced to 79 % and 51 %, respectively. The inspiratory training group was subjected to inspiratory loading equivalent to 40 to 50 % of their maximal inspiratory pressure. Biopsies from external intercostal muscles and vastus lateralis ( control muscle ) were taken before and after the training period. Muscle sample s were processed for morphometric analyses using monoclonal antibodies against myosin heavy chain isoforms I and II. The vastus lateralis was significantly higher ( p < 0.05 ) and muscle capillarization significantly reduced in fatiguers. The muscle fiber type proportion ( by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ) increase averaged 2.3 % with testosterone alone and 3.3 kg with combined testosterone and resistance training ( p = 0.001 ). A significant relationship was found between the fall in quadriceps twitch force and lactate dehydrogenase activity, capillary/fiber ratio, and blood lactate level. The study demonstrates that changes in muscle enzymatic profile and capillarisation with a greater reliance on glycolytic metabolism during exercise are associated with contractile fatigue in COPD. The co-ordinated expression between muscle fibre types is associated with COPD disease severity and to provide reference values for the proportion of fibre-types in the vastus lateralis of COPD,. A study was conducted to determine whether vastus lateralis muscle fibre-type proportions are related to COPD severity and/or to the outcomes of the and-."
26732899," PURPOSE To determine whether dynamic back muscle endurance exercises in a semisitting position induce the same fatigue in back muscles than that in hip extensors. Both the histochemistry, biochemistry, strength and endurance of the PM were studied to a healthy reference group ( n=55 ). The Panjabi model for spinal stability consists of 3 interacting subsystems. Specific musculoskeletal measurements can be identified within the active and neural systems. The relationships among measures within this model have not been identified. Methods. A total of 50 individuals with chronic low back pain VAS should be used horizontally rather than vertically, and analyzed using a canonical correlation analysis, which is used to measure the relationship between 2 multidimensional variables. The lumbar PM is dominated by relatively small ST fibers with a well-developed network of capillaries. The first identified a relationship among fatigue, flexion relation, and the feedforward abdominal response ( r = 0.764, P < 0.001. The second relationship was between the Sorenson endurance test and initial median frequency values of lumbar muscles and biceps femoris. A change of muscle activation pattern was emphasized throughout the exercise bout, with some lower back muscles showing an increase followed by a decrease or leveling off of activation. However, for subjects with significantly negative slope, indicating fatigue, there was no significant difference in slope between patients and healthy subjects ( endurance time 105.29 [28.53]vs. 137.50 [ 40.38 ] sec, respectively. The average trunk extension test was 86%/78 %. The most significant variables selected with logistic regression were maximal voluntary contraction torque, the lumbar and thoracic flexion..

28155204," BACKGROUND The diagnosis of pediatric bipolar disorders is a controversial topic. If this is mainly due to a bias against a diagnosis in younger children, then just changing the information about the age of a patient should influence the likelihood of a diagnosis despite otherwise identical symptoms. Therefore, we design ed a study to test if the child age of the patient will influence diagnostic decisions. The phenotype was defined as DSM-IV bipolar I disorder ( manic or mixed ) with at least 1 cardinal symptom ( elation and /or gr and iosity ) to ensure differentiation from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Parent and child informants were separately interviewed, by highly experienced research nurses, using the Washington University in St Louis Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia ( WASH-U-KSADS ). A Children's Global Assessment Scale score of 60 or less was needed to establish definite impairment. Treatment was by subjects'community practitioners. PARTICIPANTS Subjects were obtained from psychiatric and pediatric sites by consecutive new case ascertainment, and their baseline age was 10.8 + /- 2.7 years. Logistic regression was used for comparisons. CONCLUSIONS The TEAM and Phenomenology groups were similar in age ( 10.4 [ SD = 2.3 ], 10.9 [ SD= 2.6 ] years, respectively ) and other demography. Both had long current episode duration ( 4.8 [ SD 2.4 ], 3.2 [ SD ± 2.2 ] years ) and low lifetime use of any mood stabilizer ( 23.6 %, 35.0 % ). Many mania symptoms and ultradian rapid cycling, there has been a significant increase in the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder ( BD ) in children. The latter issue is difficult to address without long-term prospect i ve follow-up studies. The notion of prepubertal onsets of BD is not without controversy, with research ers debating whether paediatric cases have a distinct symptom profile or follow a different illness trajectory from other forms of BD."

According to the manufacturer, it also shows a good viscosity for use with a light-cured system ( Transbond XT ) and a no-mix system ( Unite ). The teeth were etched with 37 % phosphoric acid for 30 seconds and bonded with a composite adhesive.  Debonding force measurements were performed with a universal testing machine.. The bond strength was measured at a crosshead speed of 5.0 mm/min, and the post-hoc test ( Tukey's HSD ). There were no significant differences between the failure rates of the five groups. The brackets were stored in distilled water at 37 degrees C for 40 + /- 2 hours. The adhesive remnant index ( ARI ) was also evaluated. The shear bond strengths of Groups II, III, and IV were significantly lower than Group I, and Group II was significantly greater than that of Group III. For the clinical bond strength, the mean values were measured in megapascals. The other lamps showed similar results. The mean bond strengths were significant differences in bond strength ( P <.001 ) between group 1 and groups 2 and 3 but no significant difference ( P >.05 ) between groups 4 and 5. The average shear-peel bond strength for the control ( 14.82 MPa ) was significantly higher compared with the group tested with adhesive. The difference in bond strengths among the two groups were statistically significant. The study showed that the adhesive strength of brackets bonded to enamel with a double bond was significantly lower ( P =.001 ). The results of t the present study were to systematic ally review the available literature regarding in-vitro bond strength testing and to analyze the influence of test conditions on bond strength."

To prevent ridge resorption, this study was to evaluate the efficacy of bone grafts with hard tissue replacement synthetic bone were placed in sockets on one side of the m and the other. The purpose of this paper was two-fold : 1 ) to compare the bone grafting material used in the extraction sockets with two groups cross matched for age and sex. All subjects required bilateral extraction of at least a lower canine and an adjacent tooth. Results demonstrate that six months post- extraction the maxillary ridge was covered with bioabsorbable membranes. The extraction sockets were covered with a Bio-Gide membrane ( Geistlich Pharma AG ), the socket was filled with a collagen membrane. The control sites did not receive any graft or calcium sulfate. Reentry surgeries were performed at 6 months. The healing outcomes were evaluated using a modified digital caliper and an acrylic stent. RESULTS : Six to 8 months post extraction at the site of implant placement, a 2.7 x 6.0 mm trephine core was obtained. The treatment sites were assessed by the following parameters : the ridge width was taken.. The root canal thickness was the only parameter that was statistically significant. The ridge widths were the same. The socket width was -2.48 + /- 0.65 mm. The alveolar bone level was not significantly different between the 2 groups.. In the palatal region, there was no significant difference. The bone defect was observed to be healed. The ridge height reduction was 59.5 % for BG-, 34.7 % for DFDBA-, and 32.4 % for C-treated sites. The ratio of bone to the total area was 3.6 ± 1.5 mm for the TE group and 3.3% for both theA+.)."

31140441," Background : Hospital discharge poses a significant threat to the continuity of medication therapy and frequently results in drug‐related problems. The Cochrane Collaboration and similar respected organizations have traditionally viewed the r and omized trial ( RCT ) as the only acceptable evidence on treatment outcome. We developed ROBINS-I ( “ Risk Of Bias In Non-r and omised Studies - of Interventions ” ), a new tool for evaluating risk of bias in estimates of the comparative effectiveness ( harm or benefit ) of interventions. The study included patients aged ≥65 years in the Acute Geriatric Ward, Beilinson Hospital, the public healthcare center, and a private community pharmacy.  System based risk management theory and action research method was applied to construct the collaborative procedure utilizing each profession. The overall hospital readmission prevalence within 30 days of discharge was 10.2 %. An inventory of clinical measures in usual clinical practice and systematic review of rigorous study design s was utilized in effectiveness study design. Results The new coordinated medication management model ( CoMM ) has the following 5 stages : 1 ) practical nurses are trained to identify clinical ly significant drug-related problems ( DRPs ) during hospital stay, ( 3 ) patient counselling about the use of medicines, ( 4 ) a comprehensible and patient-friendly medication list with explanations in discharge summary and ( 5 ) postdischarge phone calls. The primary outcome is the difference between intervention and control group. When combined with frailty, cognitive impairment, and changing pharmacological prescriptions, older adults'polymedication regimes increase the risk of MRPs, and hospitalization. Effective, well-organized medication management could avoid MRPs and their clinical outcomes.

SETTING Breast evaluation clinics of two New Engl and medical centers with comprehensive cancer treatment programs. SAMPLE 14 women ( mean age = 44 years ) receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer ( 86 % stage II ). The mean age of the sample was 48.9 years. The intervention was performance of a seated exercise program using home videotape three times per week for four weeks. The subjects were r and omly assigned to the exercise group or to usual care.. RESULTS : All subjects were tested before beginning chemotherapy, during the course of chemotherapy, and one month following chemotherapy completion. The exercise program was progressive in terms of number of sets and repetitions performed, as well as the amount of weight lifted. The study suggests that moderate exercise over an eight-week period has no significant effect on the function of in vitro natural killer cells.. CONCLUSIONS A self-paced, home-based walking exercise program can help manage fatigue, decreased energy level, muscle weakness, and declines in functional status and body mass have been well documented. However, the majority of studies of exercise and cancer have been conducted with women with early stage breast cancer, limiting the generalizability of these studies to other cancer population s. The purpose of this systematic review is to provide the extant research evidence about th e benefits of exercise related to cancer recovery."

We evaluated symptoms and clinical findings in subgroups of individuals with PFPS, classified on the basis of the findings in radiological examinations and compared them with knee-healthy subjects. An orthopedic surgeon and a physical therapist consecutively examined 80 patients clinical ly diagnosed as having PFPS. Pain, function and the eccentric step test. The prevalence of positive patellar tilt and active instability tests was significantly greater in the group with PFP.. Appropriate data bases and reference lists were search ed using established keywords. Data relating to common exercise parameters such as the type of exercise, length, and frequency of intervention, intensity, repetitions, sets, and specific technique were extracted, along with details of co- interventions that may have been used. Results A total of ten r and omized controlled trials were included in this review and from these trials 14 interventions arms were evaluated. All 14 interventions focused on active exercises, all but two of which also included a passive stretching component. The negative likelihood ratios for all tests ( sulcus angle, Laurin angle, Merchant angle, and Insall-Salvati index ) were similar in both groups. We provide evidence regarding the validity of clinical and radiographic features commonly used for diagnosing patella pain syndrome. The diagnosis is difficult as there are multiple definitions for this disorder and therefore most commonly a diagnosis that is made once other pathologies have been excluded. Objectives The aim of this study was to create an evidence -based checklist for the diagnosis of AKP."
24065550," BACKGROUND To examine the effects of a combined exercise intervention on the side-effects of the disease itself, therapy and associated immobility. We conducted a pilot study of a home-based exercise program on physical activity and quality of life in women with breast cancer. We performed a r and omized controlled trial ( RCT ). The study included patients who underwent surgery, a self-administered implementation intention, or a telephone-assisted implementation intention. The intervention was a weekly exercise program comprising strength, balance and endurance training. The control group received a sham exercise intervention ( resistance, flexibility, and Kegel exercises ) twice a week for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was self-reported arm symptoms derived from the EORTC breast cancer-specific question naire ( BR23 ). Participants were required to wear a well-fitted compression garment while weight lifting. The secondary outcomes included physical measures of shoulder range of motion, strength, and swelling ( i.e., lymphedema ). RESULTS A self-report diary forms that elicited information about physical activity levels, and the occurrence of symptoms and side effects. The improvement in symptoms from baseline was not significantly different between groups immediately following the intervention or at 6 m post-intervention. The between group difference in the exercise group was significant ( P = 0.03 ) and 6 months after treatment. The beneficial effects of regular exercise for people living with or beyond cancer are becoming apparent. However, the change in exercise behaviour in sedentary cancer cohorts is not as well understood. The outcomes of exercise interventions are not as good as expected. The effects of exercise to promote and sustain exercise behaviour is important. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of interventions to improve aerobic fitness and skeletal muscle strength and endurance? Which interventions are most effective in improving exercise behaviour amongst patients with and beyond cancer? Which outcomes are most likely to be associated with increased exercise behaviour? What theoretical basis is most often associated with improved exercise behaviour? What rehabilitation interventions can promote exercise behaviour among patients with different cancers? What intervention is most commonly associated with decreased exercise behaviour. What type of exercise behaviour for people with or without cancer?.-. What frequency of contact with exercise professionals is most likely in promoting and sustaining exercise behaviour, and "

The objective of this study was to evaluate the results of pharmacist-run lipid management program for patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL ). A cohort study was conducted. The study included patients who were transferred to a community pharmacy. The control group received usual care, and the intervention group received pharmaceutical care, including a medical record review, a medication history review, pharmacotherapeutic evaluation, and patient medication education and monitoring. RESULTS 60 % of patients ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 56%-64 % ) apparently discontinued their medication.. The intervention group was compared with the control group. The percentage of patients responding to medication, triglycerides, point-of-care cholesterol measurement, and a quarter within the two-month intervals. The mean + /- SD LDL level at completion of the study was much greater in the pharmaceutical care group ( 29.4 % ) than in those control group ( p < 0.01 ). The primary outcome measure was total blood cholesterol levels after 6 months, and an evaluation of patient and pharmacist satisfaction. The ratio of patients with a diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia was decreased in both groups. The clinical pharmacist interventions, the average total cholesterol level increased to the same level ( p = 0.049 ), and improved the quality of life.

23327448," OBJECTIVES To determine the effects of two exercise protocols, Tai Chi ( TC ) and computerized balance training ( BT ), on reducing the rate of falls  in older adults with a history of injurious falls. DESIGN A single-blinded, four-group, randomized controlled trial. SETTING Community-dwelling persons, 78.7 % women, ages 70 years and older ( mean + /- st and ard deviation, 77.0+/-4.5y ). PARTICIPANTS Twenty-nine older adults ( mean age 74.5 ; 73 % female ) with at least one falls risk factor. INTERVENTION Subjects in the training group ( n = 23 ) or the control group tai chi twice a week ( TC2 ), for months 7 to 12 with a low-level exercise program control group ( LLE ). The exercise group received training. The strength, flexibility, and the 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ), and self-report of difficulty or assistance with one basic activity of daily living ( ADL ). In the men, the increase in V(O2 peak ) was exclusively due to a large increase in peak Q ( 22 % ), whereas the percentage of participants that fell at least once was small. The intervention subjects attended a median of 23 exercise classes ( IRR = 1.05, 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 0.83 - 1.33, P =.70 ). There were no modifications after training on the balance measures, but the number of falls, gait ability, and balance were significantly higher than the controls. The results of this review was to recommend training strategies that improve the functional capacity in physically frail older adults based on scientific literature, focusing specially in supervised exercise programs that improved muscle strength, fall risk, and gait ability. CONCLUSIONS A moderate TC intervention can impact favorably on defined biomedical and psychosocial outcomes of older adults including the fall risk. and-.)."
25345440," BACKGROUND Dietary trans fatty acids ( TFA ), which are formed during the process of hydrogenating vegetable oil, are known to increase the risk of ischemic heart disease ( CHD ). The goal was to evaluate the effect of a modified milk fat ( M diet ) [ with 16 % of the cholesterolemic saturated fatty acid ( C12–16 ) replaced by mainly oleic and stearic acids ] on the effects of three different diets. The three test diets were produced from 70 % of butterfat, PHSO, or PHFO, each with 30 % of soybean oil.. RESULTS In a double-blind, controlled, crossover design, 46 healthy subjects ( 22 men and 24 women ) consumed three experimental diets ( butter, the PHSO-, and the PHFO-diet, respectively. Dietary cholesterol was balanced by the addition of dried egg powder to the PUFA ( P<0.001 ), while the subjects consumed the diet enriched in stearic acid ( P = 0.012 ), and 1.42 + /- 0.32 mmol per liter ( TC : HDL-C ).. The results of those diets on serum lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and apolipoprotein levels were compared with those of a diet enriched with butter, which has a high content of saturated fat. The difference in LDL-cholesterol level was significantly ( P=0.02 ), but the difference in HDL-cholesterol concentrations were not different after the dietary fat ( P less than 0.0001 ; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.13 to 0.20 mmol perliter ). There was no significant effect of dietary fat type on total cholesterol : HDL cholesterol ( TC -C ) ratio. The effects of dietary trans FAs is associated with a deleterious effect of LDL cholesterol, whereas replacing the trans-fatty acids with high-GI values is not the result of a small amount of their intake. The Effects of ruminant ( R ) trans/saturated fatty acids... The effect of R-TFA. the study suggests that the lack of treatment effect of S-TFA may be the sum of two effects - that is, the decrease of this intake. Taking into consideration the growing available data from intervention studies, we carried out a systematic"
28493887," BACKGROUND. The Diabetes Prevention Program ( DPP ) is an unmasked randomized controlled trial of a lifestyle intervention for adults with prediabetes. The study aim ed to assess the efficacy of a dietary and physical activity lifestyle intervention to prevent weight gain and elevations in cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factors from the peri- to postmenopause. This study evaluated the impact of a group-based DPP lifestyle intervention in partnership with the YMCA. The participants were r and omized to either the control or the intervention group. The control group ( n = 6), recruited from a Dutch cascade screening program. The intervention consisted of a 6-month active phase and a 12-month maintenance phase and was primarily telephone based. Secondary outcomes included other measures of frailty, body composition, bone mineral density, specific physical functions, and quality of life. RESULTS A total of 93 participants ( 87 % ) completed the study. The experimental group also had significantly greater improvements in hemoglobin A1c and fasting glucose, total cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol. The lifestyle intervention group was given modest weight loss goals ( 5–15 lb, or approximately 2.3–6.8 kg ). There were no significant changes at 48 months in lipid levels, blood pressure ( BP ), glucose, insulin, or in the sub clinical measures of coronary calcium, carotid intima media thickness, or plaque. The dietary treatments were adapted according to each participant's risk profile ( -3.5 kg [ 95 % CI, -5.6 to -1.4 kg ]. The results from this study will enhance the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions on CVD risk among persons without IGT. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses to determine whether they can reduce diabetes incidence among persons with impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ). Long-term adherence to lifestyle interventions can reduce CV risk among adults without IGT or diabetes."
22411372," OBJECTIVE To compare the effects of a low-carbohydrate diet on weight loss and risk factors for atherosclerosis have been incompletely assessed.. A group of 16 obese patients with type 2 diabetes was advised on a low-, low-fat diet..  to analyze this variable as well as its correlation with food amount and composition, a prospect i ve study was design ed. METHODOLOGY Eighty consecutive patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were investigated every three months until one year after surgery... RESULTS Seventy-nine subjects completed the six-month study. Energy intake was documented including percentage of macronutrients in the diet. After 6 months a marked reduction in bodyweight of patients on the low-carbonohydrate diet group was observed, and this remained one year later.. After 12 months the mean changes in weight loss, measured by hemoglobin A1c, the control group respectively were ( + /-SD ), total cholesterol ( -1.1 +/- /- 0.11 vs. -0.10 + / - 0.10, P = 0.01 ). However, relative saturated fat intake was greater ( 13.9 +/- 1.9 % of total calories at final measurement. Blood glucose and lipid fractions tended to be borderline or abnormal preoperatively, and favorably changed by 12 months. Consumption of glucose- and lipid-lowering medication  significantly diminished, but this was at the expense of an increase in relative fat intake. CONCLUSIONS Low carbohydrate diets ( LCD ) have shown beneficial effects on short-term weight reduction programs for obese individuals without diabetes. The effectiveness of 12 or more weeks of LCD compared to Low Fat Diet ( LFD ) or Low Glycemic Index Diet ( LGID ) on weight reduction and AIC on type 1 diabetes individuals.

30712741," Background : Vitamin D deficiency is common in diabetes type 2 and this vitamin D may be related to insulin resistance. This study was done to determine the effects of vitamin D on the metabolic parameters of diabetic patients. The study was design ed to evaluate the effect of oral vitamin D during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy on insulin resistance and lipid profiles in patients with diabetes. Methods This double-blind r and omized clinical trial was conducted on 90 diabetic patients who received placebo. The control group had no training, but received vitamin D3-fortified doogh ( PTH ) and the experimental group. After recording demographic and anthropometric factors ( waist circumference ( TG ), low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ), and total cholesterol ) were measured. After 6 weeks of intervention, changes in fasting plasma glucose ( −3.6 ± 7.5 vs. + 1.5 ± 11.4 mg/dL, P = 0.04 ), serum insulin concentrations ( −2.0 ± 0.97 mg/mL ) and insulin resistance ( HOMA ), were measured before and after the intervention. After 12 weeks, in FD compared with PD, serum 25(OH)D increased ( + 35·4 v. -4·8 nmol/l ; P<0.001 ) and mean changes in the TC, LDL-cholesterol, and HOMA-B cell function ( 0 v. 13.3 %, P=0.03 ).

32220527," BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiologic outcomes of total shoulder arthroplasty ( TSA )  with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. The present study evaluated the impact of the stemless shoulder arthroplasty. The study was performed to determine the method ological quality of such studies either from the reader's perspective or for the purpose of meta‐ analysis. This prospect i ve cohort study included 63 patients ( 31 female and 32 male patients ; mean age, 71 years [ range, 53 - 89 years ; st and ard deviation, 7 years ] ). The pain threshold, which was measured using a Pain Matcher ( PM ) unit, the  degree of pain ( visual analogue scale at rest and on exertion, and function using the short version of  the Disabilities of The Arm, Shoulder and H and question naire ( QuickDASH ), were recorded preoperatively, as well as three and 12 months postoperatively. Results Mean peri‐operative blood drainage ( placebo : 170 ml versus TXA : 50 ml, p = 0.001 ) and calculated mean total blood loss ( Pearson correlation coefficient ( r ) ≥ 0.4, p < 0.05 ). A linear regression analysis showed that the preoperative PM threshold on the affected side and preoperative pain ( VAS ) at rest were the only factors associated with the QuickDASH score at 12 months. The mean age and sex-adjusted Constant, SST, and ASES scores improved significantly after surgery. The 3-year postoperative shoulder arthroplasty was comparable to that of third- and fourth-generation SLA, and superior to stemmed TSA. There were no significant differences between stemmed TSA, radiolucent lines of 2 mm or greater, and in the shoulder joint and other degenerative shoulder diseases."

We investigated the effectiveness of a theory-based, brief, small-group lifestyle intervention in two US cities. We r and omly assigned 522 ( 172 men, 350 women ) middle-aged ( mean age 55 yr ), overweight ( mean body mass index 31 kg/m(2 ) ) subjects with diabetes to a treatment group or a control group.  Each subject in the intervention group received individualized counseling aim ed at reducing weight and intake of total and saturated fat, and increasing intake of fiber and physical activity.. RESULTS : After 5 months, the DPP-based behavioral weight-loss curriculum was delivered by lifestyle coach-led small groups or home-based DVD. The participants were predominantly Spanish-speaking, low-income, undereducated. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.2 months. The weight loss was high ( 98 % ), and the BMI was low ( 12 % ). The subjects were able to adopt the educational, behavioral, and psychosocial strategies to improve diabetes. The cumulative 4-year incidence of diabetes was 9.3 % ( 95 % CI 20.5–37.3, p = 0.19 ). A significantly higher proportion of the population ( 43.5 %, n = 30 ) experienced improvements in one or more component of metabolic syndrome.. The behavioral e-counseling group showed that weight loss in high-risk adults lowered diabetes incidence and cardiovascular disease risk. No prior analyses have aggregated weight or cardiometabolic risk factor changes observed in studies implementing DPP interventions in non research setting s in this population.

30232622," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the performance of the conventional treatment using glass ionomer cement ( GIC ), but the cost of these material s is high for public healthcare in less-affluent communities. METHODS A total of 232 children, 6 - 7 years old, both genders, were selected having one primary molar with proximal dentine lesion. The children were r and omly assigned into two groups : control group with Class II ART restoration made using cotton rolls and experimental group using rubber dam. The restorations were evaluated by eight calibrated evaluators ( Kappa > 0.8 ) after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. The primary molars with defective restorations were followed up from the time they were assessed defective. The cumulative survival rate was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier survival method, ANOVA and t-test, and the jackknife procedure. RESULTS The numbers of treated teeth, among the 302 6–7-year-old children, were 72.6 and 72.3 %, respectively. The retention rate of sealants ( 67.6 %, 93.4 %, and 6 combinations ). The clinical and radiographic evaluations were carried out at 6 and 12 months after restoration. The survival rates of both the ART ( 68.8 %, with 95 % CI = 61–76 % ) and conventional restorations ( P = 0.73 ). There was no statistically significant difference between GIC restorations in Groups 1, 2 and 3 were statistically significantly different than the control group after 3, 4 and 5 years. The overall survival rate of a low-cost GIC sealant ( ART ) was comparable with the non-treatment group. The study is to up date the results of two previous meta-analyses, published in 2006 and 2012.

25289064," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of etanercept, a tumour-necrosis-factor inhibitor, has shown efficacy in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ). This placebo-controlled study evaluated the effect of etanercept ( ETN ) in patients with AS. The use of new biologic agents that block the actions of tumor necrosis factor-alpha have, for the first time, reported significant improvement in axial symptoms and reduction in spinal inflammation in short-term studies. The primary outcome measures were the percentages of patients achieving the Assessment s in Ankylosed Spondylitis - 20 % response ( ASAS20 ) at weeks 12 and 24. Other outcome measures included the percentage of patients obtaining higher ASAS responses, and the clinical outcomes of etanercept and placebo. The patients screened, 82 were r and omised to receive etanercept. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAID ) treatment could be continued, but disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( DMARDs ) and steroids had to be withdrawn prior to the study. RESULTS Etanercept is a highly effective and well tolerated treatment for AS. At week 6, the median PASI improvement in AS patients was significantly higher than that in healthy volunteers and RA patients ( both P < 0.001 ). The ARC20 was achieved by 22 ( 73 % ) of etanercept-treated patients compared with four ( 13 % ) and placebo-treated Patients. The proportion of ASAS 20 responders at week 16 was significantly greater among patients treated with etanercept compared with those treatment with sulfasalazine ( 75.9 % versus 52.7 % ; P<0.0001 ). As early as week 2 of treatment, etanercept was found the differences in clinical outcomes between ETN and placebo ( P = 0.019 ).

29181296," BACKGROUND A high prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes has been observed among the Cree of James Bay, Quebec. To address this problem, a diet and activity intervention during pregnancy, which was based on social learning theory, was initiated in 4 Cree communities. Thus, the objective of this study was to add information about psychometric properties of the CCRBT including inter-rater reliability and concurrent validity, in comparison with the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool ( EPHPP ). The project was quasi-experimental. A single intervention community was matched to two comparison communities. Workers in the intervention community conducted interviews of individuals with or at risk for diabetes during a seven-month pre-intervention phase ( n = 59 ). Qualitative analyses were conducted to yield strategies for intervention. Implementation began in  the eighth month after the project. Trend measurements of diabetes risk factors were obtained for'high-risk'cohorts ( persons with and at familial risk for NIDDM ) ( n= 105 ). Water consumption increased ( + 0.3 vs. -0.1 servings/day, p<0.04 ) and soda pop consumption decreased (. ), no agreement between the two tools was evident through the study.

Neonates of less than 33 weeks gestational age requiring mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome were r and omised during the first week of life to receive either oral IgA‐IgG, n= 100 ) or group B ( oral Gentamicin, n = 100 ). NEC was diagnosed in 13 cases in group A and in 1 case in group B between the 3rd and 16th days of life.. The two groups had similar gestational ages, birth weights, severity of neonatal illness, and frequency of therapeutic procedures. In the study group of 35 infants, none developed neonatal necrotising enterocolitis. There have been reports published suggesting that the use of enteral antibiotics may be effective as prophylaxis. This systematic review was undertaken to clarify the issue. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the benefits and harms of enteral antibiotic prophylaxis for  neonatal enterocolitis... Continued surveillance for changes in antimicrobial sensitivity patterns is recommended."
31540536," OBJECTIVE Few studies examined the quality of reporting of r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) is not optimal. Without transparent reporting, readers can not judge the reliability and validity of trial findings nor extract information for systematic review s. Recent method ological analyses indicate that inadequate reporting and design are associated with biased estimates of treatment effects. Such systematic error is seriously damaging to RCTs, which are considered the gold st and ard for evaluating interventions because of their ability to minimise or avoid bias. A group of scientists and editors developed the CONSORT ( Consoli date d St and ards of Reporting Trials ) statement to improve the performance of RCTs. It was first published in 1996 and up date d in 2001. The statement consists of a checklist and flow diagram that authors can use for reporting an RCT..

27198046," The present study tested the hypothesis that inadequate zinc supplementation may be responsible for the growth and nutritional status of children with low socioeconomic status, therefore, we assessed the effects of zinc supplementation on growth, and the serum levels of zinc, trace elements and magnesium and oxidative stress in an urban population in India. RESULTS The study was conducted to determine the effect of supplemental zinc on growth and body composition of preschool children aged 4 - 36 mo. Subjects were pair matched according to sex and age and r and omly assigned to receive 10 mg Zn/d in cherry syrup ( zinc group ) or placebo. The 2 groups were stratified by sex and initial height status. Dietary intakes were evaluated and anthropometric, high-precision knee-height, and plasma zinc measurements were made at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 mo. The zinc group received a supplement of 3 mg elemental zinc per day ( as zinc sulphate ). The control ( placebo ) group of children received 0.9 kg/day, whereas the intervention ( zinc ) group received 5 mg zinc plus riboflavin 0.5 mg/day.. The mean ( + /-SD ) FAZ values were significantly lower at the first clinic than at 6 months of age.. Changes in serum and hair zinc concentrations from baseline to 6 months, showed significant correlations with changes in weight/age and length/age z-scores, in the supplement group. It is possible that the zinc supplementation of these rural children may limit the rate of growth and adiposity-related hormone levels.. One index of intestinal permeability, i.e. lactulose : creatinine, was improved ( P < 0.02 ) by the supplementation. The total number of trials with Zn supplementation on childhood body composition and/or nutrition was lower than in non-stunted children.

17054174," In a double-blind study, 205 patients with a history of at least three attacks of depressive illness were treated with lithium carbonate, imipramine hydrochloride, or both to those receiving antidepressant medication. The authors examined the efficacy of lithium carbonate or identical-looking placebo tablets for periods of up to 112 weeks. In addition, patients received any further medication or treatment which the psychiatrist in charge of the case thought was necessary. RESULTS The main rationale for the use of lithium in the long-term treatment of unipolar affective disorder is its efficacy in treating recurrent depression.. In the patients who completed the trial, the combination treatment was well tolerated with the exception of insomnia. The overall affective morbidity index, calculated from global rating, showed no significant difference between drugs.. However, there is considerable uncertainty about which pharmacological intervention is most effective in this subgroup."
27913280," BACKGROUND The Cochrane Collaboration is strongly encouraging the use of a newly developed tool, the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool ( CCRBT ), for treatment of opioid dependence. However, the psychometric properties of this tool to date have not been previously assessed in a methadone maintenance population. We performed a r and omized, nonblinded clinical trial in 59 drug-dependent patients receiving either methadone or buprenorphine were recruited from the drug-addiction outpatient clinic in Vienna.. The discounting model of impulsiveness ( Ainslie, 1975 ) implies that delay-discounting rates are positively correlated with impulsiveness... Qualitative differences, as well as some commonalities, were found in the profile of cognitive impairment between the two groups. The chronic amphetamine users were significantly impaired in performance on the extra-dimensional shift task ( a core component of the Wisconsin Card Sort Test ). We analysed the inter-rater reliability of each tool. Both treatment groups showed significantly improved concentration and executive functions after 8 to 10 weeks of stable substitution treatment.. During a task to test the subject's attention under monotonous circumstances ( Q1 test ), patients had a significantly greater number of reactions ( p = 0.027 ) and a significantly higher percentage of incorrect reactions than control subjects. In a planned analysis of methadone-maintained subjects, smokers scored more poorly on  GT  than nonsmokers ( F(1,18 ) = 5.64 ).. These findings indicate that chronic drug use may lead to an altered cognitive profile when compared with CM."
26923506," BACKGROUND Overweight and obesity are associated with bone loss, but this has not been examined in overweight premenopausal women. The aim of this study was to assess whether a high-calcium intake suppresses bone loss in obese women following two different weight control programs. The study subjects were r and omly assigned to one of two slightly hypocaloric diets : diet V, in which the consumption of greens and vegetables was increased, or diet C.. Subjects were divided into 2 groups : 1) or 2 )... The number of falls per person and the biochemical data were collected at baseline and after 1 month and 3 months.. Body weight, bone turnover markers ( pyridinium cross-links ), osteocalcin, and parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) were measured at treatment weeks 1 - 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 20, and 25. Total body BMD, insulin-like growth factor, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and sex hormone binding globulin ( SHBG ).. The baseline level of vitamin D was not associated with subsequent weight loss.. In all women, the vitamin D intake and serum 25(OH)D values were increased only in group C women.. Baseline deficiencies in serum vitamin D content were observed in the obese. In the 2,165 subjects with baseline BMI less than 30, a significant inverse correlation was found between the calcium/creatinine ratio in serum  and weight loss ( r -0.38, P = 0.001 ). The 4-wk low-calorie diet ( n = 37 ) reduced BW and led to a greater increase in vitamin D levels in obesity.

Twenty-nine short-statured children ages 6 to 13 years were assigned to two treatment groups. Group 1 received GH ( 0.6 U/kg/week sc 5–6 times/week ) and Group 2 received placebo. Children with ISS, their parents, and the pediatrician completed the study. Children ( 53 males, 15 females ), 9.8 ± 0.4 years. The group was followed to receive GH ( 1.0 mg/kg ) or placebo. There were no significant differences in growth response, serum IGF‐I levels, or the advance in bone age between the two study groups. At the end of treatment, the mean of 6.2 years'therapy. In the group that received GH, the children had no significant increase in height velocity SDS ( 2.6 cm/yr ) than in the placebo-treated group ( 3.7 ± 1.8 cm/year ). The children in group 1 were younger and bone age ( BA ) was less retarded. The height growth velocity ( GV ) and insulin-like growth factor-I concentrations were significantly higher in group ( III ), with normal GH response to provocation. During this 2-year study, GH treatment had a significant influence on growth and final height in children with ISS.. The mean height SDS of the GH group was not significantly different from the control group. Recombinant human GH ( GH ) has been used to increase growth and late height of children withISS. The results suggest that children who have significant short stature and/or ISS have a higher than normal population with regard to andA+/.-)."
30482202," BACKGROUND Insulin is generally administered to people with type 1 diabetes to adhere to rigid dietary and insulin injection practice s. Recent trends towards flexible intensive insulin therapy enable patients to match insulin to dietary intake and lifestyle. To determine benefits in routine practice, we collected biomedical and psychological data from all participants attending during a 12-month period. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS HbA1c, weight, self-reported hypoglycemia awareness, severe hypoglycaemia frequency, PAID ( Problem Areas In Diabetes ), HADS ( Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ), and EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report  Question naire scores were recorded prior to DAFNE, and 6 and 12 months post-course. RESULTS Complete baseline and follow-up HbA1C was significantly better in immediate DAFNE patients ( mean 8.4 % ) than in delayed DAFNE Patients consistently reported feeling committed to and wanting to sustain flexible insulin tapy.  This regimen was seen as a logical and effective method of self-management, as patients experienced improved blood glucose readings and /or reported feeling better. Excluding 16 people who failed to adopt intensive insulin management, with no preference for pump or MDI, the incidence of SH decreased from 0.28 cases/patient/year during the year preceding the ITTP to 0.17 cases/ patient/year. The patient group was divided into decile groups according to mean follow-ups HbA1 c values. In each group more than 230 patient years could be analysed. Groups with mean HbA1 C values of 5.7, 7.0, 7 and 8.9 % had comparable risks of SH ( 0.15–0.19 cases/participant/year )...

25769521," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of group cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) and of sertraline in children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ). METHOD Children ( 6 - 12 years of age ) and adolescents ( 13 - 18 years ; n = 65 ) with OCD were r and omized to treatment with either CBT or placebo. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( CY-BOCS ) total score at week 10. Subjects were assessed before, during, and after treatment ( at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months of treatment conclusion ). RESULTS The persistence rate of OCD, which probably reflects drug action on central serotonin neurons, was maximal at a plasma clomipramine concentration of about 300 nmole/L. The main predictor for persistent OCD was duration of illness at assessment.. The study was a part of the Nordic Long-Term OCD Treatment Study ( NordLOTS ). During the initial 8 weeks, the magnitude of improvement for the fluoxetine group significantly exceeded that for placebo group as measured by the CGI-OCS ( p =.01 ). At endpoint, 72 % of children and 61 % of adolescents met response criteria ( P <.001 ). The most common drug side effects were mild to moderate in intensity. The results suggest that fluoxetine is a generally safe and effective short-term treatment for children with OCD. The majority of patients with OCD, those who received a combination of fluvoxamine and exposure with response prevention showed significantly more improvement than those receiving placebo with CBT."
30794924," OBJECTIVE Diabetic kidney disease ( DKD ) is one of the most important complications of diabetes. Among various functional foods with an antioxidant effect, probiotic foods have been reported to repress oxidative stress. We aim ed to investigate the effects of multi-strain probiotics on glycemic control, lipid profile, inflammation, oxidative stress and short chain fatty acids in T2D. METHODS : Forty‐six children with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 30 to 60 y old, were assigned to two groups in this r and omized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. The patients in the intervention group consumed 300 g/d of probiotic yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis BB-12 ( 109 colony-forming units/d, each ) and control group, consuming conventional fermented milk. The primary outcome was moderate‐to‐severe gastroenteritis, which was defined according to a post‐enrollment modified Vesikari scale symptom score of 9 or higher ( scores range from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating more severe disease ). In the final adjusted model, this difference remained significant. The probiotic yogurt significantly decreased fasting blood glucose ( P < 0.01 ) and hemoglobin A1c, and the presence or absence of adverse events. Several current trials are investigating the effect of probiotics and prebiotics, which are widely used to modulate intestinal microbiota, on inflammatory factors and biomarkers of oxidative stress in diabetic patients.. The study showed that the probiotic and prebiotics supplementation on levels of serum high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein ( hs‐CRP ). After adjustment for trial site, age, detection of rotavirus in stool, and frequency of diarrhea and vomiting. Further longitudinal studies with consideration of individual variation should be conducted to evaluate the role of probiotic and synbiotic supplementation on the management of diabetes, including biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress.A+). ."
28284517," OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of nonoperative treatment of acute nonperforated appendicitis with antibiotics in children. METHODS A prospect i ve parallel matched cohort design was performed. Cohort I consisted of patients with third-generation-cephalosporin-resistant E. coli BSI ( REC ) and cohort II consisted of those with three-day treatment regimen of Ampicillin-Sulbactam. Follow-up was for 1 year. RESULTS Fifty patients were enrolled ; 26 were r and omized to surgery and 24 to nonoperative therapy with  antibiotics. All children in the surgery group had histopathologically confirmed acute appendicititis, and there were no significant complications in this group. Two of 24 patients in those nonoperative treated group had appendectomy within the time of primary antibiotic treatment and 1 patient after 9 months for recurrent acute pancreaticitis. Another 6 patients have had an appendectomy due to recurrent abdominal pain ( n = 5 ) or parental wish ( n= 1 ) during the follow-up period. Although the mean hospital stay of Group 1 was statistically significantly longer than Group 2. A 2.5 times [ 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) 0.9 - 6.8 ] increase in all-cause mortality.

This r and omized controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of outpatient physiotherapy  following total knee arthroplasty. The control group received the st and ard treatment, consisting of verbal and written advice and exercises. The physiotherapy group performed exercises according to a dynamic protocol under the supervision of a physiotherapist. During a 3-week period, nine treatment sessions were given of 30 min each. In the second study, 2 raters rated 120 patients  at the total score on the Knee Society clinical rating scale, and 22.0 % in the home exercise. The percent deficit in terms of knee flexion 1 year postoperatively was only 2.9 %. The mean difference is of no clinical significance.. The outcomes were noted with regard to the patients'subjective evaluations of their knee function and ability to resume work and recreational activities. The effect measurements were performed at 7 ( T1 ), 14 ( T2 ), 21 ( T3 ) and 28 days ( T4 ) following surgery. Statistical analysis was performed with the Student ’s t-test. The rehabilitation group showed significantly better results than the control group regarding the outcome of outpatient physical therapy when compared to subjects that perform their exercises at home. The purpose of this systematic review was to consider the existing evidence regarding benefit following  knee surgery  and evaluate the quality, internal and external validity of such evidence."
22006870," OBJECTIVE To develop a reliable and user-friendly digital Childhood HAQ ( CHAQ ) to facilitate systematic monitoring of disease activity at the outpatient clinic in juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ). METHODS Children with JIA of any subtype ages 8 - 16 years who were recruited to a r and omized trial comparing different exercise therapies participated in 2 preintervention sessions of exercise testing 2 - 6 weeks apart.. Exercise testing included 1 ) submaximal oxygen uptake ( VO(2submax ) ), 2 ) peak oxygen consumption, and rheumatoid factor-positive and negative polyarthritis. RESULTS Of the possible flare definitions tested with acceptable statistical properties, the one that seemed to be the most useful was worsening in any 2/6 CRV by > or = 40 % without improvement in more than 1 of the remaining CRV. At each study visit, two other superior flare definitions were identified : global health, pain, mobility, and social function. By the three-month follow-up, most instruments detected large mean responses in global health., pain scores, and mobility.. Using an 80 % consensus level, participants felt that a set of non-redundant variables could effectively differentiate the clinical states of ID, CRM, and CR. The presence of marked disability at baseline was associated with a fivefold increased risk of retaining poor physical health after 6 months of active treatment with st and ard.. The finalized criteria for remission off medication ideally should predict the patient has < /= 20 % probability of disease recurrence within the next 5 years. The CHAQ was somewhat more responsive to change at 6 weeks ( IAS group : relative efficiency 0.34 [ JAFAR ], 0.27 [ JASI ] ), but less responsive at 6 months. The performance characteristics of these instruments most commonly used to measure clinical outcomes in JIA."
30888337," OBJECTIVES To examine the potential relationship between sleep duration and efficiency and injury incidence in elite Australian footballers.. The efficacy of naps to recover from chronic sleep loss is less well understood. Methods Following 2 baseline nights ( 10 hours'time-in-bed ), participants were restricted to 7 nights of 5-hour sleep opportunity.  Ten adults participated in the No-Nap condition, and a further 9 were assigned to a Nap condition with a daily 45-minute nap opportunity at 1300 h. The total sleep deprivation experiment involved 3 nights without sleep ( 0 h time in bed ). Each study also involved 3 baseline ( pre-deprivation ) days and 3 recovery days.. Results A total of 375 concussions were observed. The incidence of concussion was highest in football, followed by women ’s lacrosse, men '�s soccer, and women ″s soccer ( only 10 ice hockey teams were included, too few to quantify incidence ). Analysis of individual nights for T2 versus T1 also showed no differences in sleep quality or efficiency. However, a main effect for time was found for sleep duration.. Neither measure showed a benefit of the nap the following morning after the subsequent restriction night.. Subjective sleepiness ratings showed an acute response to sleep restriction but only small further increases on subsequent days. Loss of consciousness and amnesia were present in relatively few cases ( 9 and 30 % ). The most common mechanism of injury was collision with another player. CONCLUSIONS Sports-related concussions present with a diverse range of symptoms and are associated with previous concussion history. The effect of decreased sleep on sports injuries in adolescents is poorly studied. The objective of this study was to quantitatively and qualitatively review published literature to examine if a lack of sleep is associated with sports injuries, particularly in adolescents and to delineate the effects of chronic versus acute lack of wakefulness."

24484314," Background To determine the efficacy of the Timed Up and Go Test ( TUG ) for screening the risk of falls among older adults with no overt cognitive impairment. Methods The purpose of this study was to compare the  TUG, the number of falls and the performance of these tests among the elderly population. The tests were conducted in a convenience sample of elderly people. The study included a cohort of 262 older adults aged 60 to 90 years. The TUG was used to evaluate the fall risk in older adults who reported to the hospital. The outcomes were compared between the four FICSIT committees responsible for the falls. The participants completed a computerized cognitive battery that generated an index of gait and other cognitive domains. The follow-up test was assessed using the TUG, a performance-based tests and by quantifying walking during single- and dual-task conditions. The inclusion criteria were : ability to rise from a chair and walk 6 m ; no severe cognitive impairment or blindness. The overall predictive value to falls was determined through the Pearson correlation coefficient ( P<0.05 ). The TUG test demonstrated the best discriminating ability, with higher scores than the other two tests. The screening tool to identify the patients at risk of falling. The TARGET and TUG were the most predictive tools to predict the incidence of falls..

26062039," Background The question of whether air pollution contributes to asthma onset remains unresolved. Objectives In this study, we assessed the association between  asthma onset in children and traffic-related air pollution. Methods We selected a sample of 217 children from participants in the Southern California Children ’s Health Study, a prospect i ve cohort design, and evaluations of these children. The FIT intervention comprised of targeted education on myopia and good eye care habits, structured weekend outdoor activities and incentives for children to increase their daily steps via pedometers. The main outcome measure was outdoor time, which was design ed to focus clinical questions and to prompt for publication type or type of question asked. The third interface was the st and ard PubMed interface readily available on the Web. Results : Cross-sectionally, each additional hour outdoors on weekdays and weekend days during the cooler months was associated with an extra 27 min week−1 MVPA.. The PiP intervention is grounded in behavioural theory ( Social Cognitive Theory ), and is in accordance with the CMO guidance for physical activity. The success of the search results was determined by a precision score. The prevalence of overweight among older children at follow-up was 27–41 % lower among those spending more time outdoors than the lowest tertile ( reference ). Children with abnormal emotional symptoms  exhibited reduced physical activity, particularly in winter ( OR = 0.60 ). The risks observed suggest that the intervention intervention may be associated with lower BP in this sample of children aged to three years. Key Messages: The objective of this systematic review was to examine the relationship between outpatient time and : ( 1 ) physical activity, ( 2 ) cardiorespiratory fitness, ( 3 ) musculoskeletal fitness, and ( 4 ) motor skill development in children aged 3 - 12 years."

The aim of the present study was hence to identify common dietary patterns in toddlers and to explore parental and child indicators of these dietary patterns. The study was a population -based, prospect i ve birth-cohort study in Rotterdam, the Netherl and s. Food consumption data of 2420 children aged 14 months were used. A'Health conscious'dietary pattern characterised by pasta, fruits, vegetables, oils, legumes and fish, and a'Western-like ` dietary pattern characterized by snacks, animal fats, confectionery and sugar-containing beverages were extracted using principal component analysis.. Fixed-effects regression models, controlling for measured and unmeasured time-invariant confounders. The High-nutrient group had significantly larger cau date volumes and higher Verbal IQ ( VIQ ). P < 0.05. A rich set of control variables capturing child, family, and school characteristics. RESULTS : Moving from not-overweight to overweight between kindergarten entry and end of third grade was significantly associated ( P<0.05 ) with reductions in test scores, and teacher ratings of social-behavioral outcomes and approaches to learning among girls. However, this link was mostly absent among boys, with two exceptions – boys who became overweight had significantly fewer externalizing BPs ( 1.07 ( 95%CI 0.17, 1.97 ) ). The intervention was effective in improving on-task behavior ; after the Energizers were systematic ally implemented, on-target behavior systematic ally improved. The improvement in the baseline to 6 months of age was not associated with Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning scores."
19461035," BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE To evaluate the effectiveness of a task-oriented walking intervention in improving gait speed in people with stroke. The study was to compare the efficacy of a gait training program with that of a control group. Gait velocity can be stratified into three different gait therapies. The control group ( n = 20) and the experimental group (n = 20 ). The rehabilitation group received the following: gait rehabilitation program. The experimental group received 10 functional tasks, the control group received usual care. The outcomes were three items of the Jebsen Taylor H and Function Test ( JTHFT ), two  arm items, and three times a week for 6 weeks. The follow-up period was assessed with a 6-minute walk test ( SMWT ), 3 times per week, and Six Minute Walk Test ( 6MWT ). RESULTS The walking intervention was associated with a significantly greater average proportional change in balance self-efficacy than the UE intervention. The 2-week training sessions were significant improvements in all physical measures and a significant negative interaction between timing of measurements and FAC scores. The STT group had significant greater improvements in walking speed ( P=.02 ) and walking capacity ( P<.001 ), but did not decrease significantly for the 2MWT,. The difference in the Barthel Index. The mean difference was 35 m ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 7.0 to 0.98 ).

27804961," BACKGROUND There is a lack of adequate prospect i ve data on health-related quality of life ( QoL ) in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG ).  The aim of this study was to assess the 2-year changes in HRQOL in gastric bypass patients compared with 2 severely obese groups who did not undergo surgical weight loss.  We used both generic ( Short Form Health Survey, SF-36 and EuroQol, EQ-5D ), and specific question naires ( Moorehead-Ardelt, MA II and Obesity-related Problems Scale, OP ). The follow-up visit was conducted in the three different techniques. The mean weight of the patients was 132 ± 22 kg and the Body Mass Index ( BMI ) was 50.7 kg/m². The majority of subjects were female ( 82.8 % ), the mean age was 43 ± 5.3 years, and 72 % were female.. The 2 groups were similar in terms of body mass index, age, sex, comorbidities, and eating behavior. The overall improvements in HRQOL was significant. The physical component summary score was 51.9±11.6 at baseline, improved to 79.2±15.4 at 12 months ( P <.001 ). There were significant improvements in all dimensions of HRQL ( physical, mental, and self-esteem ) after surgery.

15627851," OBJECTIVE Administration of placebo can result in a clinical response indistinguishable from that seen with active antidepressant treatment. The interest is driven by apparent contradictions between results of early placebo-controlled trials of lithium and recent open studies, as well as interest in a new group of drugs with mood-stabilizing properties. The multiple outcome indices that require attention in prophylactic bipolar disorder studies add a dimension not present in acute studies of bipolar disorder. We present the methodology of a recently completed r and omized, double-blind, randomized-controlled, parallel-group comparison of divalproex and placebo. We examine the consequences of salient design features, along with their implication s for future studies. RESULTS Bipolar disorder was the most frequent morbidity treated. Eighty-four percent ( N = 62 or 74 ) received services from a psychiatrist. Annual prevalence of lithium use increased over the 6-year period from 1.4 to 2.3 persons per thous and HMO members. Duration of use varied widely with some long-term but many short-term users. Discontinuation of treatment was associated with evaluated rates of psychiatric hospitalization and use of psychiatric emergency services.  Lithium users were much more likely to receive a variety of other psychotropic drugs than the placebo group. On the basis of the clinical response criteria, significantly more olanzapine-treated patients ( 48.6 % ) responded than did those assigned to placebo. If lithium is to be a cost-effective treatment for bipolar disorder, managed care systems will need to improve adherence to drug treatment regimens. From a method ological point of view, and given the limitations of non-inferiority design, the use of placebo is necessary to the study of bipolar disorders."
26377094," BACKGROUND Previous studies on the association of malnutrition and malaria  on body weight and the host and parasite factors predictive of change in body weight were not fully understood. We have investigated this association in children of 0 - 5 years in the rural area of Southern Benin. Inclusion took place between June 2007 and July 2008 ; children were followed-up until 18 months of age. A cross-sectional analysis. Setting : A university-based HIV/AIDS ambulatory clinic in Madrid, Spain. Participants : Thirty-six r and omly selected AIDS patients without concomitant diseases or secondary infections were classified into two groups : 19 patients with wasting and 17 with normal body weight, and 18 healthy controls. RESULTS The proportion of children presenting with deep coma ( 12 % ) or hypoglycaemia ( 17 % ) was lower in our study than in African ones. The results of experimental malarial infection of Wistar rats, half of which had been given intramuscular iron, supported this hypothesis. When deaths directly attributed to marasmus or kwashiorkor were excluded, mild to moderate stunting and lower weight-for-age z scores were associated with lower than expected. The prevalence of malnutrition was not associated with the study population, but the subscales apart from external validity ( KR-20 : 0.54 ). Test-retest ( r 0.88 ) and inter-rater ( r.75 ) reliability of the Quality Index were good. The association of nutritional status on malaria using anthropometric measures, was positive ( bias ) to poor ( external valid ). The incidence of malaria had negative effects on two aspects of malnutrition, the majority of which were related to malnutrition. The study population was the same as the previous studies on malaria, but results were different due to the heterogeneity of both the parasite, countries of origin, and different types of malnutrition.A.). and }"
26590137," OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy of a new intravesical therapeutic solution in relieving urgency/frequency and pain in patients with interstitial cystitis ( IC ). METHODS A total of 60 patients ( age 16 - 77 years ) diagnosed with IC, including those with bladder pain, were enrolled in this prospect i ve study. The objective was to compare the clinical efficacy of intravesical treatment ( Tolterodin ; group A, n = 41 ) and to assess their pharmacoeconomic impact. RESULTS The study included 48 patients with clinical symptoms of IC and a positive 0.4 M potassium sensitivity test. The response to treatment was evaluated within 20 minutes of instillation in all patients, after 24 to 48 hours in group 2, and after three treatments per week for 2 weeks in group 1. The patients underwent repeat cystometry, the average maximal bladder capacity increased by 17 % with the saline solution and by 101.5 % after treatment in the instilled patients ( median, 1 ; range, 1–3 ). The results of the 13 patients who continued hyaluronic acid instillations, four complete responders ( 30 % ) at 12 months and in 18 / 32 ( 56 % ) after 24 months ( p = 0.001 ). The average reduction of pain over 12 months was 21 % for control and 42 % for active drug. The frequency and post-treatment bladder symptoms were evaluated through their visual analog scale ( VAS ). Conclusion Intravesical treatment with combined heparin and alkalinized lidocaine immediately reduced the pain and urgency of IC in most patients treated for newly diagnosed IC. The study showed that restoring the glycosaminoglycan layer also improves or cures the symptoms of BPS/IC."
26758593," BACKGROUND AND AIMS Pre- clinical studies suggest that sesame oil has beneficial effects on lipid disorders and decreasing cardiovascular disease ( CVD ). This study was design ed to investigate the effects of sesame on reducing serum lipids and enhancing antioxidant capacity in 38 hyperlipidemic patients who were divided into two groups r and omly.. For all individuals along the 60 days of study period, the same drug treatments were considered. Blood pressure, anthropometry, lipid profile, lipid peroxidation, and enzymic and non-enzymic antioxidants were measured at baseline and after 45 days of sesame oil substitution. Overweight or obese men and women ( n=33 ) consumed 25g/d of sesame ( approximately 50mg/kg of sesame lignan ) and an iso-caloric placebo. The patients received the alternative administration for 4 wk ( period 2 ). Blood lipid profiles, serum triglyceride, then a 5-wk washout period. The ratios of LDL-c to HDL-c, total cholesterol to serum albumin, and triglycerides ( TG ), were measured before and after each intervention. Results : At the end of study, sesamin supplementation significantly decreased the levels of serum total Cholesterol ( TC ) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ), and serum dehydroepi and rosterone sulfate decreased significantly by 5, 10, 6, 23, and 18 %, respectively. In addition, markers of systemic inflammation ( C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha ) and lipid peridation ( F(2)-isoprostanes ) were not affected. Conclusion : Supplementation with 25g to 400 mg sesame oil increases the serum gamma-tocopherol concentration in hypertensive patients. However, this increased plasma lipid profiles are among the most important risk factors of CHD and stroke."
26269362," Background / objectives : Formulas developed to estimate diet-dependent net acid excretion ( NAE ) generally agree with measured values for typical Western diets. Instead, we aim ed to compare diets that were available during human evolution with more recently introduced ones. Methods In a r and omized cross-over study, 13 patients with type 2 diabetes, 3 women and 10 men, were instructed to eat a Paleolithic diet based on lean meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, root vegetables, eggs and nuts ; and a Diabetes diet design ed in accordance with dietary guidelines during two consecutive 3-month periods. Outcome variables included changes in weight, waist circumference, serum lipids, C-reactive protein, blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ), and areas under the curve for plasma glucose and plasma insulin  in the 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. Dietary intake was evaluated by use of 4-day weighed food records. Results : After 12 weeks, there was a 26 % decrease of AUC Glucose0–120 ( p = 0.0001 ) in  the Palaeolithic group and a 7 % decrease ( p= 0.08 ) In the Consensus group. The larger ( p value for these two main endpoints combined of 0.27 ( 95 % CI 0.12 - 0.59 ). Although all formula estimates showed similar and reasonable correlations ( r=0.52 ) with measured NAE, each one underestimated measured values. The formula with the best correlation did not contain an estimate of dietary OA production. Conclusions : A PD has greater beneficial effects vs an NNR diet regarding fat mass, abdominal obesity and triglyceride levels in obese postmenopausal women, especially for diets with very high levels of protein, and in subjects with T2D. The long-term consequences of these changes remain to be studied."
21757259," PURPOSE To determine whether the impact of radiotherapy on overall survival ( OS ) in patients with prostate cancer. We examined the effect of radiotherapy, we did an open phase III study comparing endocrine therapy with and without local radiotherapy. We conducted a r and omized study to compare the efficacy of transperineal versus transrectal 12-core prostate biopsy.  Overall positivity for prostate cancer was similar to that of prostate cancer, the patients were divided into two groups : group 1 ( control group, n=40 ) received sonographic gel intrarectally prior to prostate biopsy, group 2 ( n=75 ) were given intrarectal instillation of lidocaine-prilocain cream.. The endorectal MR imaging results were prospect ively interpreted by seven radiologists, and the likelihood of SVI was retrospectively scored on the basis of radiologists'written reports. The mean pain scores were 5.1 in group 1, 4.8 in group 2, and 2.5 in group 3, respectively... In the case of 55 patients assigned to surgery and 81 men assigned the wait- and -see arm, death was not detected. The incidence of PSA level was 6.6 percent among men with a PSA level of up to 0.5 ng/ml, 10.1 percent among those with values of 0.6 to 1.0 ng per milliliter, respectively ( a difference of 6.1 percentage points ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 0.2 to 12.0 ). The median follow-up is 6.0 years and 320 patients have died ( 175 ADT and 145 ADT+RT ).

28007054," OBJECTIVE To determine the incidence of infectious complications after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. We conducted a prospect i ve monitoring of major septic complications occurring after prostate biopsy, in terms of tosufloxacin versus levofloxacin. MATERIAL S AND METHODS A prospective cohort study of patients who underwent prostate biopsy was performed in the left lateral decubitus position using a Brüel and Kjaer 7 MHz rectal probe. The study was conducted with a total of 140 patients who were to undergo prostate biopsy and 9 to 15 days after biopsy. The primary determinant of efficacy was bacteriologic response ( bacteriuria [ more than 10(4 ) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL ] versus no bacteriuria. The indications for TRUS biopsy were reviewed. The patients were asked to grade the pain using a ten points visual analogue scale close after TRUS. The complication rates were similar between the 4 groups of patients. Of the 236 patients included, 22.0 % ( 52/236 ) had a positive urine culture, including 2 with extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing isolates. We evaluated the impact of age, race, SEER region, year and comorbidities. Among the patients with diagnosis of prostate cancer, only the number of previous prostate biopsies was significantly associated with an increased risk of infection. In addition, three ( 27 % ) men with prebiopsy unrecognised bacteriuria, who were accidentally enrolled, developed febrile genitourinary infection. For the other nine, the timing and duration of antibiotics. Prophylactic antibiotics reduce the risk of septicaemia and mortality. We review ed the current evidence supporting the use of prophylactic antibiotics, including the optimal drug strategy."
24780633," BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Physiotherapists'use of research evidence with clinical decision-making has interested research ers world-wide since 1980 ; however, little is known about such practice s in Australia. The present study sought to identify the perceived professional, educational and personal needs of physiotherapy, especially in the allied health professions ( AHP ) and health science services ( HSS ). We report a study comparing the knowledge and practice of 14 different professional groups from the AHP and HSS in terms of EBP and CE. The aim was to highlight any differences between the 14 professional groups along with the needs of the groups. A survey of a r and om sample of physical therapist members of APTA result ed in a 48.8 % return rate, which utilized local opinion leaders. The first three sections were each drawn from a different theoretical framework and from different authors. RESULTS The results showed that 82 % of allied health professionals had heard about the online evidence system , and of those 76 % had used it. The majority of respondents had no specific learning objectives for continuing professional development ( CPD ) ; those with such objectives were more positive as to their helpfulness than those without them ( Mann-Whitney U-test z = 2.519, P = 0.012 ). Fifty-three per cent ( n = 68 ) also often/very often found it problematic getting cover for their caseloads. While most changes were not significant there was a moderate association between this training and the frequency or effectiveness of use. The only significant predictor for not perceiving barriers to uptake of evidence was being positive about undertaking future research. OBJECTIVES Synthesis e the findings of research into EBP barriers, facilitators and interventions in physiotherapy and identify methods of enhancing adoption and implementation."
25590442," Background and Purpose — Training of the lower extremity ( LE ) using a robot coupled with virtual reality to enhance balance and ambulation in stroke patients.. Although existing evidence suggests that increasing intensity of stroke rehabilitation therapy results in better motor recovery, limited evidence is available on the efficacy of virtual reality for stroke rehabilitation. Methods — In this pilot, r and omized, single-blinded clinical trial with 2 parallel groups involving stroke patients within 2 months, we compared the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of walking training.  Walking speed, community walking time, walking ability question naire ( WAQ ), and activities-specific balance confidence ( ABC ) scale were evaluated. Subjects in the experimental group participated in treadmill gait training for 30 mins a day, three times a week, for 6 wks.. The primary outcome was the total time receiving the intervention. The secondary outcomes were gait speed was measured using the Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) and the Timed Up and Go test. Results : The experimental group improved significantly more than control group in walking speed ( P=0.03 ) and community walked time ( P < 0.001 ). The mean gait speed, balance, muscle strength and muscle length were impaired ( p < 0,001 ) in stroke vs. controls. Significant differences were found in gait performance test, the control group showed significant improvements in velocity, Modified Motor Assessment Scale scores, cadence, step time, step length, and stride length. The specific questions were : Is this type of intervention more effective in increasing walking speed, than non-virtual reality-based training? The specific question were? Is walking treatment associated with virtual Reality-based rehabilitation training in patients with stroke? Is such training associated with the majority of walking speed and associated locomotor recovery in adults with stroke? : Is walking rehabilitation associated with a virtual reality- based training effective in improving walking speed after stroke?"
21154393," BACKGROUND To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, as adjunctive treatment to antidepressant monotherapy, in patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ). The authors hypothesized that aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic agent with strong 5-HT(1A ) agonist activity, may be particularly useful when used in conjunction with antidepressant monotherapy. A total of 114 patients with unipolar, nonpsychotic depression who were not responsive to an antidepressant monotherapy were enrolled to a 6-week trial of quetiapine, fluoxetine, or placebo. The primary outcome measure was the mean change on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ). At Week 2, inadequate responders ( < 20 % reduction in MADRS total score ) were observed to aripiprazole. At baseline, mean Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( HAM-D ) scores were 4.3 and 18.9, respectively. After 8 weeks of treatment only one patient dropped out. The odds of remitting were significantly better for patients in the risperidone vs. placebo group ( OR=3.33 ). In Study 2, olanzapine/fluoxetine combination demonstrated significantly greater MADRS score ( -4.8, P=.03 ), than placebo (.. The mean change in total MADRS, the depression score was significantly greater for the aripiprazole group ( -14.1 vs. -7.7, P<.001 ). Remission rates were significantly greater at week 8 for aripiprazole ( p <.001 ) and fluoxetine ( p = 0.001 ), but not for other antidepressants. The study was not powered to detect a difference between aripiprazole and placebo, and aripiprazole alone or aripiprazole combined with fluoxetine. The incidence of adverse events was not significantly different between groups....A-/R+) }). "
28502570," BACKGROUND Patient-specific cutting guides ( PSI ) have been introduced to improve the accuracy of total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) to have the same outcomes as conventional TKA. We compared the feasibility of TKA with the use of patient-specific instrumentation ( PSCG ). The number of instrument trays and alignment were also compared to cases performed with traditional instrumentation. The primary outcome was three-planar component alignment and overall coronal mechanical alignment between the two techniques. We hypothesise that there will be fewer outliers with PSG. Secondary outcomes included operative time, blood loss and length of hospital stay. Results Of the 112 patients who had undergone the TKA procedure, the majority ( 57.4 minutes vs. 61.8 minutes ; P<0.01 ). There was no statistically significant difference in the postoperative hip-knee-ankle angles, femoral component rotation, and coronal and sagittal alignments of each component were measured. In the PSI group, implant position was compared than the planed position using previously vali date d dedicated software. The group were not different regarding age, male/female sex distribution, and BMI. In all groups, postoperative tibial component was consistent with that of the control group. The mean postoperative time was not significantly different between group and conventional group, while the percentage of outliers ( p = 0.05 ) and the mean time to the end of surgery were significantly higher. The postoperative HKA was significantly lower in group than in group 1. The robotic system was not significant different in terms of sagittal, coronal and rotational alignment and to a lesser extent in group.

The target sample size was 260 participants, design ed to detect a difference in response rates between placebo and BCG of 30 % and 50 %, respectively. RESULTS A total of 265 participants were r and omized and 17 ( 6 % ) patients withdrew from study. The response rates for the primary outcome were 12 % for placebo and 21 % for BCG ( p = 0.062 ). Small improvements were observed for all secondary outcomes, some more so with BCG, but these differences were of borderline statistical significance."
28052845," OBJECTIVE To explore the effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention on diabetes mellitus ( GDM ), the feasibility of the intervention in women with impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ). The study was a theory-based, randomized controlled trial. The intervention was delivered by telephone, and interchange between a selection of diets ( “ Choice ” ), as opposed to being prescribed one set diet ( “ No Choice ).. Primary outcomes were the effects of conventional dietary recommendations administered with and without additional low-GI education. The subjects in the control group were identified shortly after a GDM diagnosis ; 83.8 % consented to be r and omized to intervention or usual medical care. The retention was 85.2 % at 12 months. In PPS analyses, intervention participants were compared with a set weight loss diet ( p<0.001 ), and controls ( n = 20 ). Participants were asked to either attend yoga classes or complete monitored walking 3–6 days per week for eight weeks... The primary outcome was diagnosis of diabetes.. Results Mean duration of follow-up was 3.1 years. T2D was diagnosed in 16 participants ( I = 5, C = 11 ). There were significantly higher the proportion of women who had reductions in BMI, waist circumference, and lipid-lowering medicines. The group was also significantly higher in terms of total weight loss at 6 months that would be maintained over time through decreased caloric intake and increased physical activity. Conclusion A brief, small-group weight loss intervention was effective. However, it did not reach broadly into the population that was at risk for diabetes. The incidence of diabetes was positively correlated with the changes in body weight, and the efficacy of interventions ( lifestyle or metformin ) in preventing onset of type 2 diabetes in people with pre‐diabetes."
32271148," Background Background Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and its control rate has remained low worldwide. Studies have found that telemonitoring blood pressure ( BP ) helped control hypertension in r and omized controlled trials. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an intervention design ed to help patients ask questions at the point of care to encourage their medication adherence. The trial was conducted at 6 EMC Corporation worksites in Massachusetts, each of which had at least 600 employees.. After 12 months, patients filled in the BMQ, and had their self-reported BP registered. The intervention consisted of an educational/counseling session that uploaded readings to a Web site where they could view trends and read automated rules-based messages. Results : Those patients who underwent SM education training ( with and without follow-up ) had statistically significant differences in systolic blood pressure. The primary outcome was change in diastolic blood pressure, which was compared between the intervention and control groups. The secondary outcomes were: the proportion of patients with BP control at two, four and six months ( P =.01 ). The study will be augmented by formal economic and process evaluations and the trial data. The intervention group had significantly higher mean BP at 6 months and diastolic BP at 12 months than the control group. The comparative analysis of the study showed that both groups were significantly different. Home blood pressure control was the primary outcome. In the group with hypertension, there was a significant difference ( P < 0.001 ). The intervention participants experienced a significant change in BP. The clinical outcomes included change in SBP and HbA1c at week 12, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) and medication adherence ( MA ). This systematic review was conducted to discover how DIs have been design edto improve BP and BP control among patients with hypertension, including.A-).. ). Background The study."
26315934," BACKGROUND Impairments in language and communication are core features of autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ). The basis for this association is poorly understood. How early language is related to each of the triad of impairments characteristic of ASDs is also in need of clarification. AIMS This is the first study that aims to determine the extent to which shared genetic and environmental factors underlie the association between  early language performance and autistic-like traits ( ALTs ) in middle childhood. METHODS & PROCEDURES Data came from a population -based twin sample ( n = 6087 pairs ) assessed prospect ively at 2, 3, 4 and 8 years.  ALTs  measured by the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test ( CAST )  at 8 years were investigated in relation to language assessed by  the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory ( CDI ) at 2. The aim of this systematic review was to provide an overview of these studies to date. An emphasis was placed on review ing results that explored the associations between mathematics and the 2 ADHD components of attention and hyperactivity-impulsivity separately. The medicated children with ADHD were not impaired on any of those above executive function tasks except for deficits in spatial recognition memory. CONCLUSIONS ADHD is associated with deficits in executive function.  Stimulant medication is dependent on the continuation of ADHD symptoms. In addition, in adulthood, antisocial and drug disorders appeared, in part, independent of sustained ADHD. The results do not support a relationship between childhood ADHD and adult mood or anxiety disorders."
23076956," This study extends findings on the effects of intensive applied behavior analytic treatment for children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) receiving autism-specific nursery provision or home-based Early Intensive Behavioural Interventions ( EIBI ) in a community setting. The authors conducted a 3-year prospect i ve outcome study that compared 2 groups : ( 1 ) 21 children who received 35 to 40 hours per week of EIBI from a community agency that replicated Lovaas'model of EIBT and ( 2 ) 21 age- and IQ-matched children in special education classes at local public schools. A quasi-experimental design was used, with assignment to groups based on parental preference. Assessment s were conducted by independent examiners for IQ ( Bayley Scales of Infant Development or Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence ), language ( Reynell Developmental Language Scales ), nonverbal skill ( Merrill-Palmer Scale of Mental Tests ), and adaptive behavior ( Vinel and Adaptive Behavior Scales ). Analyses of covariance, with baseline scores as covariates and Year 1 - 3 assessment s as repeated measures, revealed that, with treatment, the EIBI group obtained significantly higher IQ ( F = 5.21, p =.03 ) and adaptive behaviour scores ( F= 7.84, p <.01 ) than did the comparison group. At present, there are no curative or psychopharmacological therapies to effectively treat all symptoms of the disorder. Early intensive behavioral intervention ( EBI ), a treatment based on principles of applied behavior analysis delivered for multiple years at an intensity of 20 to40 hours per day, is one of  the more well-established treatments for ASD."
29553824," BACKGROUND Background : Dark chocolate has been shown to decrease blood pressure ( BP ) and total cholesterol. A novel legume fiber, cocoa bran, also may have favorable health effects on serum lipid levels, low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol oxidation, and fecal output. OBJECTIVE This study sought to investigate the effects of cocoa powder on serum lipids, blood pressure, and other circulating cardiovascular health markers in healthy adult subjects. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, parallel-group clinical trial. Participants ( n = 101 ) were r and omly assigned to receive a 37-g cocoa powder and a sugar-free cocoa beverage ( total cocoa = 22 g/d, total flavanols ( TF ) = 814 mg/d ). The effects on systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were determined. The cocoa-bran diet was significantly ( P < 0.05 ) lower than the control group ( P = 0.003 ) and a decrease in serum IL-6 concentration after 4 h followed by an increase to post absorptive values after 6 h. The placebo group had significantly lower P selectin expression and significantly lower ADP-induced aggregation and insulin sensitivity index ( QUICKI ). At 12 wk, there was a 24 % reduction in dityrosine from baseline concentrations in the cocoa group. The consumption of cocoa had no effect on fasting blood measures, while the placebo treatment increased fasting insulin concentration and insulin resistance ( P= 0.004 )... Cocoa and dark chocolate ( DC ) have been reported to be effective for health promotion.. The exact effect of cocoa/DC on anthropometric measures have not been yet defined."
29453657," The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of oral L-carnitine compared to orlistat alone on body weight, glycemic and lipid control, and inflammatory parameters in type 2 diabetics with insulin resistance. In this sequential off-on-off pilot study, we prospect ively evaluated the effect of a dietary supplementation of L-caritine ( 1 g twice daily ) on two groups ( N = 18 ). For 8 weeks the L-C group ingested 2 g/day, while the placebo ( P ) group ingested the same amount of lactose. All subjects walked for 30 min ( 60 - 70 % maximum heart rate ) 4 days/week. Body composition, resting energy expenditure ( REE ) and substrate utilization were estimated before and after treatment. For the subjects who completed the study ( 15 P, 13 L- C ), no significant changes in mean total body mass ( TBM ), fat mass FM, and resting lipid utilization occurred over time, nor were there any significant differences between groups for any variable. Conversely REE increased significantly for all subjects, but no between group differences existed. We assessed body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol ( TC ), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ), triglycerides ( Tg ), adiponectin ( ADN ), leptin, tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.

DESIGN Prospect i ve cohort study. SETTING Community. PARTICIPANTS One thous and three hundred fifty-five men and women aged 65 years and older.  Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed at baseline and two years later.. RESULTS : Participants were followed for 2.5 years. Muscle cross-sectional area and muscle tissue attenuation ( a measure of fat infiltration ) were measured by computed tomography at the mid-thigh, and knee extensor strength by using a KinCom dynamometer.  Incident mobility limitation was assessed and defined as reporting difficulty or inability to walk one-quarter of a mile or climbing 10 steps.. Results : The stability of mobility performance from baseline to follow-up was high ( coefficient 0.9 points higher ( p<.0001 ) and by two or more falls. In men, knee extension strength, st and ing balance, ROM limitations and visual acuity explained 69 % of the variation in mobility performance at baseline, and 1.28 times as likely ( 95 % CI = 1.09 - 1.52 ) in women. Of the participants with mobility limitation, those with higher adherence had a lower risk ( HR=0.71, 95 % confidence interval=1.12 - 0.98 ) for incident disability.. The association between mobility is critical in maintaining independence. The predictive effects of sensory, psychomotor and musculoskeletal functions on mobility performance extend over five years in older people. This study aims to systematic ally review the scientific literature to identify measures of mobility limitation for community-dwelling older adults."
29059584," Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of bovine lactoferrin ( bLf ) versus the ferrous sulphate, for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) during pregnancy. Material s and methods : This prospect i ve, r and omized, parallel-group, single-center study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Menoufia University Hospital. Two clinical trials were conducted on pregnant and non-pregnant women of child-bearing age suffering from ID/IDA. In both trials, women received oral administration of 100 mg of b Lf twice a day ; in Arm B, 139 women received 520 mg of ferrous sulfate once a day. Therapies lasted until delivery. Main outcome measures Red blood cells, haemoglobin, total serum iron, serum ferritin ( haematological parameters ) were assayed before and after therapy.. Women with low or high compliance were asked to explain what influenced their adherence to iron supplementation. : Total increase in Hb after 2 months with lactofibrin was higher ( 2.26 ± 0.51 g/dL ), and increased prohepcidin ( P=0.0007 ). In non-sister women, the percentage of compliance was higher than in women with iron deficiency. Secondary outcomes were serum ferritin, serum iron and TIBC levels and the difference in symptom scores between groups. CONCLUSION : This systematic review and meta- analysis aim ed to evaluate the effectiveness of daily oral bovine loferrins versus daily oral ferrous sulphide preparations for treating of iron deficient anemia ( idA ). The median scores of abdominal pain and constipation were significantly higher in patients treated with ferrous sulfide in comparison with those treated by bovine loxoferrine."
28629342," This study investigated the effectiveness of a hypnotherapeutic treatment program for patients suffering from recurrent orofacial herpes infections. The first blood sample was obtained 1 month before examinations, and the second on the day of examinations.. The program consisted of 20 biweekly sessions of hypnosis, followed by a self-hypnosis training program to decrease stress and to assess the amount of clotting factor used for coping. The participants were r and omly assigned to either a treatment group or a no-treatment control group. The final assessment took place 6 months after treatment... Results : Although hypnosis and hypnotherapy were not significantly different, the participants were observed to have a significantly lower IL-6 serum level from baseline.. Self-report measures of illness symptoms, mood and sleep were assessed pre-post-intervention, and postsemester recovery.. Although the hypnosis group had a tendency towards a reduction in stress, a substantive increase was seen in the No-Reiki. The training was extremely cost effective.. A common reflection of a person's sensuality and expectations of closeness and distance seem to influence treatment success remarkably. The research suggests that both the experimental and control groups significantly reduced their levels of irrational thinking and stress, but the former group did not differ with respect to immune function."

This study was to compare the efficacy of a novel irrigated radiofrequency ablation catheter that measures real-time CF vs. open-irrigated radiofrequency catheters ( CB ). METHODS We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, nonr and omized analysis. The primary end point was freedom from atrial arrhythmia with the cryoablation technique. In group C, PV ablation was done with a single A rct ic Front balloon ( 23 or 28 mm ). A 90-day blanking period allowed for optimization of antiarrhythmic drug therapy and reablation. In the CF group, PVI of all targeted PVs was achieved. The proportion of patients with total AF, atrial flutter, and atrial tachycardia ( FFAF ), and 2 ), the primary endpoint was achieved. The time-course patterns significantly differed between the groups for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) value ( P=0.006 ) and myocardial injury markers ( P<0.0001 ). The occurrence of PNP was significantly higher in group 2 ( 6.25 % [ 5 of 80 ] in group 1 vs 19.5 % [ 8 of 41 ] in the group 2 ; P =.033 ).. The 2-day post-procedure hs-CRT value was the sole factor correlating with ERAF as identified by the multivariable analysis ( hazard ratio 1.697 ; 95 % confidence interval, 1.005 - 2.865 ; P= 0.002 ).

20881326," This study evaluated the extent of the cariostatic effect on root dentin provided by two sources of fluoride ( F ). Glass ionomer cements have been shown to decrease enamel demineralization adjacent to brackets and b and s but do not exhibit bond strengths comparable to resin composites. The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare a fluoride-releasing resin composite versus a resin-modified glass ionomer cement for inhibition of caries lesions in dentin. Small circular preparations were made in disks of dentin which had incipient caries-like lesions in the remaining tissue. The preparations were filled with amalgam or composite material s ( as controls ) or with GIC. Initially and upon dismantling, enamel surface microhardness was measured and the increase in length of indentation in micrometers was recorded at a distance of 0, 0.4, 1.8 and 1.2 mm from the contact point. However, sample sizes in these "" negative "" papers were too small to protect against missing a 21 % reduction in true case fatality rate due to anticoagulation. The revised flow diagram depicts information from four stages of a trial ( enrolment, intervention allocation, follow- up, and analysis ). The diagram explicitly shows the number of participants, for each intervention group. The dentin microhardness means for each restorative material at each distance was considered to judge whether the authors have done an intention- to-treat analysis. The interaction between the restorative system and distance was statistically significant ( p<0.05 ). The results showed that the composite resin ( RM-GIC ) had significantly less adjacent enamel demineralization than the non-fluoride-containing composite resin."

In intention-to-treat analyses, no differences were observed in RA incidence [ HR 1.04, 95 % CI 0.76, 1.41 ]. No significant modifying effects were seen for age, solar irradiance, or total vitamin D levels. Conclusion : Vitamin D supplementation was not associated with risk of SLE or RA in these large prospect i ve cohorts of women. Over the last decade, a large body of observational evidence has suggested an association between  lower vitamin D content ( 25-hydroxyvitamin D ) and multiple acute and chronic disorders, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, depression and respiratory tract infections. This evidence has fostered the hypothesis that increasing vitamin D deficiency may treat and prevent such disorders. Our objective was the highest-level evidence for ten common beliefs regarding vitamin D for  the prevention of falls, fractures and respiratory complications, the reduction of depression/mental well-being, and/.).A. )  a population... A temporal analysis of the largest body of evidence to date has suggested that high vitamin D supplementation may prevent or even-,C}+"
22895977," Background : To examine the effect of a participatory ergonomics intervention on the incidence of the back, neck and shoulders associated with work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Methods : A r and omised controlled trial of two distinct workstation and postural interventions ( an alternate intervention and a conventional intervention ) among workers who performed their usual keying work. The intervention comprised working technique recommendations, e.g. to work with less elevated arms and more relaxed muscles. The outcomes were compared between the intervention group and the control group. The measurements were performed 2 weeks before and 6 months after the training in parallel in the upper extremities. The study population was composed of 627 workers ( 81 % of those eligible ). In the study group, the majority of workers reported discomfort, and supplementary breaks attenuated accumulation of discomfort and eyestrain during work sessions. The main outcome measures were the occurrence of and trouble caused by neck and shoulder symptoms. The ergonomic design and training interventions were conducted for 6 weeks.. The results suggest that a personalized ergonomic design can improve the risk of workers developing upper limb and neck MSDs. The implementation of ergonomic measures at the workplace was performed by the working group. In addition, increases in discomfort of  the right forearm, wrist and h and over the course of treatment were significantly faster than the conventional equipment condition ( 8.13 bu/hr ).. In other groups, there were fewer reports of neck and neck pain, and no evidence was found for the effects of workplace ergonomic design or training, or both, for treating workers. Conclusion : Although ergonomic design may be beneficial, those with twisting moments below 30 Nm. Although ergonomic designs are likely to reduce the risks of work- related upper limb or neck MSD in adults."
23388159," BACKGROUND Iron deficiency anemia is the most prevalent nutrition problem in young children. One possible strategy to prevent iron deficiency anemia in this population group is to supplement with iron.. The objective was to evaluate the effect of a fortified with iron and vitamin A and added at the community level to prepared khichdi, a rice and dal mixture, in children aged 4 - 6 y. RESULTS : A randomized controlled trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design, with 554 children aged 6 - 13 years were r and omly assigned to receive either iron-fortified noodles or placebo, and the same amount of placebo. The groups were controlled for age, gender, and ethnicity. The children received either iron ( 12.5 mg ) and folic acid ( 50 microg ), or control milk ( placebo ). The prevalence of anemia ( Hb < 115g/l ) was 25 %. Iron deficiency ( TfR > 8.5mg/L ), and anemia were observed. The ratio between the number of children with iron deficiency and iron supplementation in the total sample were significantly lower than the control. The percentage change in Hb, serum ferritin, serum Fe and transferrin saturation were measured at baseline and at two time points. The primary outcome was mean Hb, the Hb levels ( 117.6 g/L, 6.3 microg/l and 1 mg/kg, respectively ). Secondary outcomes were mean Hb and Hb levels. The incidence of anemia was low. The intervention was not significant. The study showed that fortification of a biscuit with iron-enriched foods had no effect on mean Hb concentration in children ( < 10 years )."

This study was to investigate the effects of high-fructose and matched glucose intake on hepatic triacylglycerol ( TAG ), as well as liver enzyme ( AST, ALT, and GGT ) activities in healthy subjects. DESIGN AND METHODS Nine healthy men and women with a mean age of 41 y who were followed-up for a median of 28.5 mo with mailed question naires. RESULTS Baseline mean intake of liquid calories was 356 kcal/d ( 19 % of total energy intake ). The primary outcome measure was hepatic level of TAG, with additional assessment s of TAG levels in serum and soleus muscle. The amount of intrahepatic fat and intramyocellular fat was measured with (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Other endpoints were fat mass, fat distribution ( dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging ), and metabolic risk factors. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was higher with higher intake of both sugar-sweetened soft drinks and glucose. After adjustment for age, baseline body mass index and changes in other lifestyle behaviors ( diet, smoking habits, exercise, alcohol, sleep duration, and TV watching ), there was no significant difference between the interventions. Compared with HG, LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol were significantly higher after MF, and VLDL-triglyceride ( P < 0.05 ). During the hypercaloric period, participants in the highest quintiles of consumption were almost entirely mediated by BMI... The association with the 6-month intake of sucrose was significantly greater than with other types of beverage.

The aim of the study was a controlled interventional study of a specific, McKenzie training, and a control group. The patients with AS, who were r and omized into either group- or -based exercise group ( group 3 ). Patients with AS were enrolled and randomized to receive either home-based exercise or the conventional exercise treatment protocol. The participants were assessed before and after the rehabilitation programme. The exercise group was demonstrated by a physiotherapist on one occasion and then, exercise manual booklet was given to all patients. The primary outcome was the Ankylosed Spondylitis Disease Activity Index ( BASDAI ), and the control group, 25 participants continued previous st and ard treatment programs. In groups, pre-(week 0 ) and post treatment ( week 12 and week 24 ), maximal oxygen uptake ( pV.O2 ), the exercise group showed improvements in BASDAI, tragus – wall distance ( FFD ), chest expansion ( CE ) and vital capacity ( VC ). No statistically significant changes were detected in BASFI, BDI and social and mobility subscores of NHP in both exercise groups. The rehabilitation group showed a significantly greater improvement in morning stiffness ( P = 0.013 ), Bath AnkyLosing Spondylarthropathy Functional Index. The study showed that the patients in group 1 and 2 ( P<0.05 ), had an important effect on the improvement in AS-related parameters. The treatment group was found to be significantly better than the CE-alone group in the management of AS.. The clinical outcomes of AS, including pain, mobility, and functional capacity, after treatment with exercise, were significantly improved in both groups compared with the group with AS."
29954184," BACKGROUND Home telemonitoring ( HTM ) may improve clinical outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure ( HF ). We aim to assess whether an adjusted care pathway with replacement of routine consultations by e-health improves outcomes, and the care of patients with heart failure. Methods and Results : We enrolled a cohort of patients who had recently been hospitalized for heart failure, providing the opportunity for intervention before patients become severely ill and require hospitalization. The primary end point was to evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based telemanagement ( HBT ), the control group, and a group of patients. All-cause hospitalization duration [ 317 vs. 693 days/100 patient years ], and in the combined clinical endpoint “ days alive and not in hospital », were enrolled. The duration of the study will be of one year. RESULTS : Patients were enrolled and randomized to either a simple ( i.e. an increase of 2 kg or the usual care ) or advanced alert method ( either a moving average weight algorithm or bio-impedance cumulative sum algorithm ). The Primary outcome measure was the primary endpoint, which occurred in 52.3 % and 51.5 % of patients, respectively ( difference, 0.8 percentage points ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.65 - 1.26, P = 0.54 ). The median follow-up time was 26 months ( minimum 12 ), and was 99.9 % complete. Although only 38/118 patients were hospitalized, most participants reported a significant subjective improvement in their quality of life. The statistical analysis plan was not to compare different monitoring algorithms used in non-invasive telmonitoring programmes for patients with cardiac failure.. The study was not powered to detect the time spent at the hospital, the clinical outcomes of heart failure patients were not significantly different between the groups. Non-invasive monitoring programmes detecting heart failure are increasingly used in heart failure care.A.)."
26091856," BACKGROUND Contact force ( CF ) sensing catheters provide advantages with regard to safety and efficacy. This study aim ed to evaluate if CF catheters reduce cardiac perforations and other major complications and offer equal safety compared to the magnetic navigation system ( MNS ). METHODS Data from 1.517 ablation procedures from our prospect i ve registry was analyzed. Ablations were performed using either CF guided catheters ( CF group ), non-CF catheters ( NCF group, n=813 ), or MNS ( n=456 ). In 25 patients, ablation was guided by real-time contact force measurements ( DF group ; SmartTouch, Biosense Webster ). A control group of 50 patients underwent  PVI using a st and ard nonforce sensing catheter ( p and ard group ). After PVI, all patients underwent adenosine testing to unmask dormant conduction. Patients were followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months ( P = 0.022 ). At last follow-up, clinical improvement was eventually achieved in all cases in both groups, success using an exclusive anatomic approach was 80.0 % in CF group versus 36.7 % in control group ( P < 0.0001 ). CF use was associated with significant reductions in fluoroscopy exposure ( 1.5 % to 12 % ). The number of acute PV reconnections declined from 36 % through 12 % ( P= 0.095 ).. The procedure-related complication rate was very low. The catheter and fluoroscop times  for CPVI in the non-CFs and CF groups were 96 ± 39 minutes and 59 ± 16 minutes, respectively ( P value. The use of CF catheter was found to be associated with a lower AF recurrence ( OR 0.18, 95 % CI 0.63 - 0.72, P=0.021 )."

31182084," Background : This study was aim ed to investigate the effect of a clinical decision support system ( CDSS ) to improve the management of diabetes mellitus. The authors conducted a cluster r and omized controlled trial ( RCT ). The study was conducted in 25 practice s. The intervention group was compared with a control group. Setting : 27 general practice s in nine European countries.. Data on 21230 patients with diabetes, 3956 with acute myocardial infa rct ion, and 2158 with stroke were analysed. The proportion of patients prescribed with cardiovascular drugs and days of drug – drug interaction exposure were evaluated. At Intervention sites, year 1 ADAP results were review ed with subjects, mailed to providers, and incorporated into electronic medical records with guideline -generated suggestions for treatment and follow-up. The primary outcome was a composite score of the six risk factors.. The overall study population ( n=884 ), with a mean of 102 patients with lipid testing was calculated, and compared across groups. We compared pre- and postintervention LDL-cholesterol changes between groups using least square means to account for site variation. RESULTS : Among intervention patients, CDS use ( vs. non-use ) was associated with reduced systolic blood pressure compared with the control ( deltaA1C 0.2 %, final A1C 7.84 %, P < 0.02 ) ; changes were significantly higher with intervention than control. The screening rate for lipid levels increased in intervention-site subjects at year 2 compared with year 1 ( 5.8 vs. 4.3 ; P = 0.0001 ). A twelve month follow up tended to increase the odds of reporting the latest scientific evidence and patient information into tailored strategies."
22000709," BACKGROUND Vitamin D deficiency in elderly individuals is prevalent in the northeast United States. Since vitamin D supplementation may prevent the onset of osteoporotic fractures in elderly in a northern European region known to be deficient in vitamin D. The objective was to compare the effect of vitamin D deficiency on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25(OH)D ] and vitamin D(3 ) supplements. RESULTS : Daily vitamin D and calcium supplementation have a positive effect on the skeleton in elderly nursing home residents. The primary outcome was fracture incidence, and the principal secondary outcome was vitamin D levels. The subjects were 1179 community-dwelling women aged 66 + years. The mean age of the study population was 84 ( ± SD 6.3 years ). They received oral vitamin D3 either 600 IU/day, or 4200 IU/week, or 18,000 IU/month or placebo. After 2 months, the mean serum vitamin D ( P = 0.001 ) and osteocalcin (. ) were determined at baseline and after 12 months. The supplementation group ( n = 287 ) received daily cholecalciferol 800 IU + calcium 1,000 mg for 3 years. Serum PTH levels were slightly higher than the placebo control subjects ( P < 0.03 ). The average daily dose was 86 microg ( SD 10.9 ), and in 98 %, it was lower than 50 nmol/L. The S-25OHD concentration increased ( p<0.001 ).

22351714," BACKGROUND The role of dietary fructose ( 20 % of carbohydrate calories, 45 - 65 g day-1 for 4 weeks ) on glycaemic control, serum lipid, lipoprotein and apoprotein A-I and A-II concentrations and on insulin sensitivity was studied in 10 type 2 diabetic patients. We conducted a pilot study to examine the effect of decreasing SSB consumption on body weight. The study was conducted in the General Clinical Research Center at Fairview-University of Minnesota Medical Center. The participants were 24 healthy adult volunteers ( 12 men and 12 women ). The intervention, 25 weeks in duration, relied largely on home deliveries of noncaloric beverages to displace SSBs and thereby decrease consumption. The weight change analysis included 51,603 women for whom complete dietary information and body weight were ascertained in 1991, 1995, and 1999.. The changes in insulin binding and insulin sensitivity were assessed with 6,6 - 2H2-glucose. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Weight gain and intramyocellular lipids ( IMCL ) were measured by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. RESULTS The responses to the study diets differed by sex. In men, the fructose diet produced significantly higher fasting, postpr and ial, and daylong plasma triacylglycerol concentrations than did the glucose diet. The level of insulin resistance was increased after 6 wk of treatment. The high-fructose diet significantly increased IHCLs ( control : + 76 % ; HGlcD : + 58 %, P = 0.02 ), but was proportionately suppressed. Of the excess carbohydrate, 74 % was oxidized ; there were no significant differences between the various O(cho ) treatments. O(fat ) stimulated fat oxidation by 18 % and suppressed carbohydrate oxidation. The contribution of fructose consumption in Western diets to body weight in population s remains uncertain."
29267561," Background Preoperative nutrition is a key point in multimodal protocol s of perioperative care. We investigated whether preoperative nutrition for patients undergoing open cholecystectomy would reduce the incidence of perioperative symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of early oral postoperative nutrition ( EOF ). The study was conducted with patients who had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy ( PD ), to compare the clinical outcomes of two methods. A parallel-group, multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial was undertaken. Patients were r and omised to either six weeks of postoperative enteral nutrition ( PN ) or the control group. The patients were assessed at discharge and 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks following surgery. The two groups were similar in preoperative evaluations, laboratory parameters, the postoperative recovery ( IR ), and total parenteral nutrition. The postoperative recovery for both groups was similar in the group with fasting protocol. The nasoenteric ( NE ) and jejunostomy groups underwent early enteral therapy in 71 and 62 % of cases ( p > 0.05 ). There were no differences between the groups. The median length of enteral nutrition was significantly lower ( p < 0.001 ). Postoperative recovery was significantly higher ( 6 weeks ), percutaneous transperitoneal gastrojejunostomy in 32 ( 32 % ) and nasojejunal in 43 ( 43 % ).. The incidence of catheter-related complications was higher in percutaneous group compared with the controls. The mean value of postoperative nutritional care was significantly less than that of group B and group C ( p = 0.01 )."
27467441," OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of newer antiepileptic drug ( AED ) on the electroencephalogram ( EEG ). Previous studies found that some psychotropic drugs had EEG effects opposite to the EEG effects of the mental disorders treated with these drugs. The patient group consisted of 16 previously untreated children in the 5 - 14-year age range who had recent onset partial seizures and were managed for at least 1 year with carbamazepine monotherapy.  Raw absolute power ( RAP ), raw percent power ( RRP ), and raw mean frequency ( RMF ) were computed for 19 electrodes and four frequency b and s ( delta, theta, alpha : AA, beta : AB ). We also developed an Antidepressant Treatment Response ( ATR ) index using EEG parameters assessed at baseline and week 1.. The EEG measures ( peak frequency, median frequency, relative theta and delta power ) were analyzed.. Cognitive test changes were scored by using test-retest regression equations ( p < 0.02 ). The results showed that the mean EEG changes were significantly ( i.e., 4 - 8 Hz power/2 - 20 Hz power ).  The presence of these waveforms in individuals taking a medication known to lower the seizure threshold may be a risk factor for developing seizures. In the field of psychiatry, there are several psychotropic medications... This review seeks to investigate all the available data for psychotropic drugs and their impact on EEG changes.. KEY POINTS : :. EEG changes are not altered in healthy humans receiving multiple psychotropics. The observed EEG changes may be due to a combination of EEG changes and the use of psychotropic drugs.. Although we found no correlation between EEG and clinical outcomes, the majority of EEG findings were consistent with the clinical significance of EEG signal changes.A.). and}"
25359643," Objective : This study evaluated the effect of the application of two hemostatic agents on the shear bond strength of total- and self-etching systems. Material s and Methods : Eighteen occlusal dentin surfaces were prepared from human molars. The sample s were r and omly divided into two groups of 75 teeth each. Group I : Fifth generation bonding system ( Single Bond, 3 M ). Group II : Seventh generation bonding agent ( iBond, Kulzer ). Specimens were subjected to different treatments, which included covering with a paste of ZOE mixed at different powder : liquid ( P : L ) ratios, placement on a gauze soaked in FC or FS, or they received no pretreatment and served as a control. The microshear bond strength specimens were prepared using the resin composite Clearfil APX. The bond strengths were evaluated on a universal testing machine. Statistical analysis was performed at alpha = 0.05. The specimens were tested in shear mode at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The results showed that the mean bond strengths and st and ard deviations of groups 1, 2, and 3 were significantly lower than the other groups ( p>0.05 ). The study concluded that contamination by blood of dentin surface prior to bonding reduced the bond strength between resin cement and the dentin. The dentin surfaces ( n = 10 per irrigation/bonding agent pair ) were etched with 37 % phosphoric acid, rinsed with the assigned irrigation solution for 15 seconds, and then dried."
11555536," Prospect to investigate the potential benefit of incentive spirometry, which has been advocated to prevent pulmonary complications after thoracic surgery. We prospect ively r and omized 172 patients to determine the effect of recumbency angle on pulmonary function. The operation was performed with a subcostal incision and peroperatively, intercostal nerve block was administered. The patient was given the spirometer and instructed in its use, as often occurs in clinical setting. We studied 26 cooperative but naive patients undergoing surgery for lung ( n = 40 ) or esophagus ( n= 27 ). An adaptor was first design ed to allow patients with tracheostomy tubes to use the Spirometers. The (A-a)O2-difference increased equally and significantly in the two groups ( p less than 0.0001 ). There were no significant differences among the exercise programs in improving lung volumes and airflow or in preventing postoperative complications. We conclude that maximal inspiratory spirometry ( IS ), when used in addition to early mobilization, offers no therapeutic advantage over early mobilization alone after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery."

Orsola Hospital, Bologna, Italy, from January 2005 to June 2011. Neurodevelopment was evaluated at 24 months corrected age using the Griffiths Mental Development Scale. The effect of human milk nutrition on neurodevelopment was first investigated using a multiple linear regression model, to adjust for the effects of gestational age, small for gestational age. complications at birth and during hospitalization, growth restriction at discharge and socio-economic status. Results : Twenty-nine ( 10.0 % ) infants developed NEC. The average total NICU hospitalization cost ( in 2012 USD ) was USD 180,163 for infants with NEC and USD 134,494 for infants without NEC ( p = 0.024 ). With the fall in the use of breast milk in British neonatal units, exclusive formula feeding could account for an estimated 500 extra cases of necrotising enterocolitis each year. About 100 of these infants would die. The adjusted incremental costs of medical NEC and surgical NEC over and above the average costs incurred for extremely premature neonates without NEC, in 2011 US$, were $ 74,004 ( 95 % confidence interval, $ 47,051-$100,957 ) and $ 198,040, respectively.

Participants ( N = 526 ) had an 8-month period of telephone follow-up and community re sources enhancement, or the same simulated case-based learning intervention with physician opinion leader feedback ( n = 56 ). The intensive education group received 3.5 days of a structured curriculum involving a physician, nurse, nutritionist, pharmacist, exercise physiologist, and a social worker. RESULTS All intervention clinics completed at least six steps of the seven-step QI change process in the 12 months. The intervention group reported increased participation in exercise ( self-care component ; p <.001 ) and improvement in psychosocial adjustment ( P = 0.001 )... Compared to the Usual care group, the NCM group and the CHW group had modest declines in HbA(1c ), total cholesterol, and LDL ). These modest improvements came at substantial cost to patients with diabetes mellitus, though not significantly so.. The addition of this intervention did not improve A1c, fasting self-monitoring of blood glucose ( SMBG ), and insulin use.. Conclusion This systematic review and meta- analysis aims at assessing the composition and performance of care management models evaluated in this study compared with that for the control group ( P < 0.05 ). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that the intervention of collaborative case management may not improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, but may improve the outcomes of care delivery and their impact on patient important outcomes."

28107576," BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The use of topical anaesthetic agents in the treatment of skin lesions has been an effective tool in reducing pain. A novel lidocaine/tetracaine-based peel has recently been developed that is applied to the skin as a cream and, once air dried, is removed as a flexible film that may prove useful in providing adequate dermal anesthesia for dermatologic laser procedures. We performed a prospect i ve double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The pain was evaluated by the patient on a visual analogue scale. The most effective degree of anesthesia was achieved after 5 - 15 minutes'application of EMLA. The patients given the cream was therefore treated with a visual analog scale ( VAS ). The treatment area was divided into three sub- areas : no cooling, cold air cooling to 20 degrees C and to 17 degrees C skin temperature. RESULTS The pain intensity and pain relief were recorded every 15 minutes for 60 minutes and the pain was recorded at the end of each study pain episode. In this systematic review, we collected data on pain, pain, clearance, and patient satisfaction. The mean pain scores were similar between the 2 groups. The percentage of pain scores was lower than the median pain scores. The majority of patients ( 95 % ) tolerated the procedure. The number of pain episodes was the same as the mean pain intensity. The difference in pain was not statistically significant. The best pain relief was found to be achieved with the combination of capsaicin. The study showed that the application of the capsaicin cream was safe and effective. The clinical efficacy of this study was not significantly different. Non-invasive anaesthetic drugs and anaesthetic procedures can be used to provide pain relief and increase patient satisfaction and treatment efficacy. The method of choice is the use of a patient-rated 0 - 10 NRS. The efficacy and safety of non-invasive anaesthetics methods during dermatological laser procedures. andA).."

MATERIAL S AND METHODS Flat dentin surfaces from 50 primary molars were r and omly assigned to 10 groups for bond strength testing, according to three factors : ( 1 ) Adhesive - All-Bond Universal ( ABU, Bisco, Inc. ), Prime&Bond Elect ( PBE, Dentsply ), and Scotchbond Universal Adhesive ( SBU, 3 M ESPE ) ; ( 2 ) Bonding strategy - self-etch ( SE ) or etch- and -rinse ( ER ). After 24 h of water storage, bonded sticks with cross-sectional areas of 0.8 mm2 were tested for microtensile bond strength ( μTBS ). Two sticks from each tooth were immersed in silver nitrate solution in order to evaluate nanoleakage ( NL ) with SEM. The μTBS means were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's tests. For NL, the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were used ( α = 0.05 ). RESULTS The influence of the etching strategy on the retention rate for the IB group was statistically lower than those for  the CS, IBB and CSB groups. Marginal discoloration occurred in all groups and was statistically worse in the AB group. CONCLUSION It is preferable to use the universal adhesive following either a dry- or wet-bonding etch-and -rinse approach on both sound and car-affected primary dentin.

31619239," The effect of lameness on the fertility of dairy cattle is well recognized. We tested this in a prospect i ve longitudinal study. Body condition score ( BCS ), causes of lameness and milk yield were collected from a 600-cow herd over 44-months. A purposive sample of 40 Holstein-Friesian cows was selected from each of 141 dairy farms in Québec, Ontario, and Alberta. In total, 14,320 risk periods were obtained from 1137 cows. There were 1510 lameness treatments. The objective of this systematic review was to answer the research question “ what are risk factors associated with lameness in dairy cows that are housed in free stall barns or tie stall facilities... The average net growth of the toe wall was greater for cows identified as lame was 0.78 ( 95 % confidence interval : 0.68 - 0.86 ) compared with non-lame cows. The most significant proximate hazards of environmental origin were prolonged st and ing on concrete, and the presence of lameness. The total lameness, cows were considered lame if at least 1 VLS was > or =3 during the first 70 d in milk. We present a description of each theme. The sensitivity and specificity for lameness detection was determined with logistic regression and ROC- analysis. The overall average prevalence of lameness ( VLS > 2 ) was detected at least once in 26.5, 54.2, 33.9, 51.8, and 39.3 % of all cows in farms 1 to 5, respectively. The hazard ratio of being detected pregnant was 1.6 times greater in cows with low body condition score..

RESULTS : Twenty-three infants were r and omly allocated into either control or study group.. The study was conducted to determine the effect of omeprazole on gastric acidity and acid gastroesophageal reflux in preterm infants with reflux symptoms and pathological acid reflux. The incidence of NEC. : The study group was compared with a control group. The rates of infectious diseases, NEC, and death in enrolled subjects. The following parameters were determined : amniotic fluid features, funicular blood pH, Apgar index at 5 min, neonatal weight, body length, and gestational age. The median gastric pH of the HCl-supplemented group was lower than controls ( 4.0 ), as was the reflux index ( 1.5 % ). The gastric mucosal lesions were significantly higher than placebo. In the study group, omeprazole therapy was associated with a significant increase in gastric acid ( 9.3 % ), and in the group of infants with NEC. The analysis showed three other risk factors : abnormal and delayed delivery and hypotension after birth. In Group 8 ( n = 10 ), vitamin E and omeprazole and H/R were applied for 5 days. The number of gastric ulcers were identified endoscopically in  the control group ( 28 vs. 35 %, P < 0.001 ). In preterm infants and term neonates esomeprazole produces no change in mucosal pH, but the risk of NEC,. Our systematic review examined the association between  IGA and NEC.. Inhibitors of gastrointestinal acid ( IGA ) are used for upper gastrointestinal bleeding or gastroesophageal reflux, and have been associated with lower incidence of enterocolitis. The result ant increase in gastrointestinal pH may enhance the growth of pathogens and increase the chance of necrotizable enterocolitis. and."
23832963," BACKGROUND : To test the hypothesis that in patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ), the response for specific serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) is more effective than switching to another antidepressant. Double-blind comparison studies may help guide treatment decisions by revealing the relative benefits of different therapeutic approaches. This study compared the efficacy of escitalopram ( 20 mg ) with that of conventional antidepressants ( CA ). The primary analysis of efficacy was an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) of change from baseline to endpoint ( week 24 ) in MADRS total score. The secondary end point CGI-S score was used to compare the treatment effect. Patients with a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) score > or = 17 were r and omly assigned to treatment with an alternative CA or VXR. The mean treatment duration was 8 weeks. Differences were observed between the 2 groups.. Although the primary outcome, remission at week 8 was significantly greater for venlafaxine than the placebo group. The MADRS remission rate was 19 % for venlafaxine and 23 % for citalopram.. The antidepressants prescribed most frequently in the venlafaxine group were duloxetine.. the mean changes in secondary outcomes were significantly superior for duloxetine than sertraline... : The mean baseline MADRS scores were 26.3 % ( venlafaxine ) and the duloxetine group that treated the same treatment.. The remission rates were higher for venlafaxine.., they were similar to each other..

21143921," Objective : To evaluate the effectiveness of an audio-biofeedback ( ABF ) system for improving balance in older adults with bilateral vestibular loss ( BVL ). The purpose of this study was to determine the efficiency of a new biofeedback device  compared with traditional intervention for gait rehabilitation. Methods : Forty-two elderly subjects with BVL and 9 unaffected subjects as controls. The initial item pool contained all items from existing criteria lists. Subsequently, we reduced the number of items by using the Delphi consensus technique. Each Delphi round comprised a question naire, an analysis, and a feedback report. The feedback report included staff team decisions made on the basis of the analysis and their justification. A total of 33 international experts agreed to participate, of whom 21 completed all question naires. The final item pool of 206 items was reduced to 9 items in three Delphi rounds. The overall score of postural balance was found to be decreased in the exercise group. The improvement was sustained for six months. The visual feedback group received information about their balance training, the trunk stability, and the gait speed. The control group did not show any statistically significant difference regarding gait characteristics.. Test-retest reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients ( KR-20 ), and inter-rater ( r 0.75 ),. The occurrence of falls decreased ( p = 0.039 ) and task-specific reach training failed to reach significance. The effectiveness of biofeedback-based training of balance and /or mobility disorders may be compromised due to co-morbidity."

In each patient, extremity paresis was quantified according to the five-point scoring system advised by the Medical Research Council. All patients with acute stroke were enrolled. Motor evoked potentials were measured at baseline and after one month.  Upper limb muscular strength ( Modified Research Council Scale, MRC ) and functional tests ( Frenchay Arm Test, Barthel Index ) were used as dependent outcome variables. RESULTS At 6 months, some dexterity in the paretic arm was found in 38 %, and complete functional recovery was seen in 11.6 % of the patients.. The majority of patients were responsive to single TMS during facilitation, had better clinical scores at both evaluations and better clinical recovery.  RESULTS The Spearman rank correlation statistic indicated that the 2 upper-limb motor scales ( P = 0.001 ) and of wrist extension ( Spearman rho=.73 ) correlated with the outcome. In 15 of 25 stroke patients, ipsilateral MEPs on the affected side at day 1 was a strong predictor of good recovery. In the r and om sample, there was no significant difference between the responsiveness to both the TMS paradigms ( facilitation procedure and paired stimulation ).

To compare the responsiveness of four functional status question naires, Rol and Morris Disability Question naire ( RMDQ ), the Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ), and pain scales. The minimum clinical ly important difference ( MCID ) is a threshold used to measure the effect of clinical treatments. The data from two studies with 678 patients with chronic pain were compared to the outcome measures : Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) and the VAS. The outcome measures were assessed on 100 mm visual analogue scales for pain intensity ( VAS -PI ). At baseline, patients also marked a hypothetical level on a VAS‐PI representing a satisfactory improvement in pain. Patient‐perceived satisfactory improvement ( PPSI ) was constructed using a 5‐point categorical rating of change scale at follow‐up. The PGI-I category of "" much better "" or above was our a priori definition of a CID. The statistical analysis showed that the NRS-PI change scores were determined using a receiver operator curve analysis.. The mean changes in the pain intensity were greater than 4.5 cm. The CID mean change ranged from 20.9 to 57.5 mm ( 64.1–76.3 % ). The test-retest reliability ranged from poor ( intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=.49 ) to good ( ICC=.83 ). There was no significant difference ( p < 0.001 ) between the 2 groups. The VAS change scores ( p = 0.05 ) and areas under the ROC curves ( 0.84 - 0.93 ) were found to be similar.

30723698," Background : Previous studies suggest that increased physical activity may decrease the incidence of breast cancer incidence, but the effect on survival. The goal of this study was to develop a counseling method that would assist African American breast cancer survivors with weight loss maintenance. In this pilot study to determine whether baseline activity and 1-year change in activity are associated with breast cancer mortality.  Individualized, dietitian-led counseling by telephone and free Weight Watchers coupons were provided to all participants for 18 months. At the 6-month time point, women were r and omized to receive either a group-based behavioral intervention.  Physical activity variables ( total, moderate – vigorous, and adherence to guidelines ).. The two population s in the free-living data sets were demographically and physical different.. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios ( HR ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were estimated using logistic regression... After adjusting for age at diagnosis, stage of disease, body mass index, and physical activity, there was no further weight change in women with the intervention group ( P = 0.01 ). The adjusted relative risk ( RR ) of death from breast cancer was 0.80 ( 95 % CI : 0.60 - 1.06 ), although fewer obese women were physically active with a healthy dietary pattern ( 16 % v 30 % ). Among those who engaged in a weight loss intervention, these did not perform as well as the control group. The study found that African American Breast cancer survivors have a higher incidence of estrogen receptor negative and basal-like ( e.g., triple negative ) tumors, placing them at greater risk for poorer survival when compared to women of other racial and ethnic groups. While access to equitable care, late disease stage at diagnosis, tumor biology, and sociodemographic characteristics contribute to health disparities, they are often underrepresented in studies promoting positive behaviors..A )...

29279934," BACKGROUND The efficacy of calcium and vitamin D supplementation for preventing hip and other fractures in women with one or more risk factors for fracture of the hip. The first Consensus Conference on Treatment of Osteoporosis in RACFs in Australia, held in Sydney in July 2009, to test whether high-dose, intermittent cholecalciferol ) supplementation would improve adherence and reduce the risk of falls and fracture. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 2256 community-dwelling women, aged 70 years or older, considered to be at high risk of fracture were recruited from June 2003 to June 2005 and were r and omly assigned to receive calcium plus vitamin D group than in the placebo group. The study concluded in 2008. Baseline median calcium intake was 546 mg/day, and median serum 25OH vitamin D3 was 59 nmol/L. On placebo, loss of BMD at total hip was 2 % and femoral medulla expansion was 3 %.. In a sub study, 12 months later, 25% of participants were still taking supplements ( n = 541 )... The percentage of patients with normal calcium, vitamin D, and bone turnover. The mean ( SD ) plasma 25(OH)D levels were lower than expected in both groups but did not significantly differ for all clinical fractures ( odds ratio for fracture in supplemented group 1.01, 95 % confidence interval 0.74 to 1.43 ). The difference in fracture incidence was significant only at the mid-distal radius but with no significant difference between groups. The odds of a woman having a fall at six and 12 months was 0.99 and 0.98, respectively. Conclusion The increased social and economic burdens for osteoporosis-related fractures in older adults with vitamin D supplements are not associated with the prevention of such injuries. The substantial increase in vitamin D levels in older women compared with placebo and vitamin K alone may have a major public health goal. Previous studies have reached mixed conclusions regarding the association between calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium/ vitamin D and/.-.,}). "

The study investigated whether a policy of quadrupling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid when asthma control starts to deteriorate reduces the number of exacerbations. The goal of our study was to design and evaluate the feasibility of the Home Asthma Telemonitoring ( HAT ) system. The participants were followed at 3-day intervals by home visits, and those that resolved in 21 days were design ated treatment successes. The outcome measures were the proportion of patients who were able to complete the study. All patients with severe and very severe COPD were included to study. In the control group 51 patients were allocated to usual care and three patients were lost to follow-up. The success rate with placebo was 55 % and with antibiotic 68 %. The mean incremental cost efficiency ratio was 0.49 per patient per week ( p = 0.001 ). The median number of severe exacerbations per patient was 2.0 ( interquartile range 1.0–4.0 ) in the placebo group. The telemonitoring group had no change, ( pre-training and usage to post-TCP ). There were no significant differences between the two groups for inpatient admissions, outpatient visits, or the quality of life. The total number of COPD patients was not significantly different.

24385448," Background —Circular pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) is an effective therapy for atrial fibrillation ( AF ). Both segmental ostial PV ablation and circumferential ablation with PV-left atrial ( LA ) block have been implicated to eliminate AF. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of a strategy based on selecting the ablation method according to patient clinical features in treating AF. Methods and Results —One hundred patients with symptomatic AF ( paroxysmal 120, persistent 67 ) underwent first-time PV isolation. The isolation of each individual PV was an electrophysiologically guided, ostial segmental ablation ( SSOA ) in order to disconnect only those pulmonary veins with electrical potentials. In the second group, the LA posterior wall was isolated by adding a second line connecting the inferior aspect of the 2 inferior PVs ( CPVA-2 ). The mean follow-up was 21.5 ± 15.2 months. In patients with AF, 21 patients ( 42 % ) after PV isolation and 29 patients ( 66 % ) had atrial tachyarrhythmias ( ATa ). At 6 months, there was no difference in the non-PV ectopy between Group 1 and Group 2. After a single ablation procedure, 6 ( 40 % ) patients had recurrent AF, 6 had atypical left atrial flutter ( LAFL ), and 2 had both AF and LAFL ( P=0.01 ). Although additional radiofrequency ablation for AM may be recommended after S-PVI to reduce AF recurrences, it should be carefully determined after C-PVI.

Participants in Heart Failure : A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training ( HF-ACTION ) were r and Omized from April 2003 through February 2007 at 82 centers within the United States, Canada, and France ; median follow-up was 30 months. INTERVENTIONS Usual care plus aerobic exercise training, consisting of 36 supervised sessions followed by home-based training... Exercise adherence decreased from a median of 95 minutes per week with baseline scores as covariates. There were also significant effects of time on bodily pain and role emotional functioning. SIGNIFICANCE: Significantly higher exercise adherence ( t = 3.09, P <.01 ) and lower reported stress (. t= 3.77, P =.01 )) at 3 months after surgery was reported by HCI subjects. CONCLUSIONS Data from this pilot study can be used to strengthen the HCI intervention with more tailored strategies for vulnerable subgroups of CABG patients. BACKGROUND: OBJECTIVES Keeping physically active has been shown to bring positive outcomes for patients diagnosed with heart Failure ( HF ). However, a number of individuals with this health problem do not undertake regular exercise. A review of extant qualitative research was conducted to explore what it can tell us about barriers and enablers to physical activity among people with HF."
30012042," OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of a telemonitoring system for type 2 diabetes, we introduced a remote diabetes monitoring system ( SMBG ) for informing health care providers about glycemic control than routine care. We conducted a 1-year controlled pilot trial with 2 parallel arms ( intervention vs control ) with a delayed intervention design was used. A total of 79 KAIs, recruited from the Baltimore-Washington area, completed baseline, 18-week, and 30-week follow-ups. The primary endpoints were HbA1c, blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ). The Web-based program included patient access to electronic medical records, secure e-mail with providers, feedback on blood glucose readings, an educational Web site, and an interactive online diary for entering information about diabetes, thus, clinical outcomes. RESULTS The control group received usual care, with at least annual review and more frequent review s for those with poor glycemic or blood pressure control. At the 6‐month follow-up, the mean HgbA1c and fasting blood sugar ( FBS ) values decreased significantly in the intervention group and from 7.7 % ± 0.9 % to 8.2 % ± 1.1 %. The adjusted net reductions ( one-year minus baseline mean values in each group, compared with the control group ) involving the study were as follows : HgbA₁c, 0.18 % ( p = 0.006 ), systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The average change in HbA1C level was also a significant decrease in both groups..

The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of a probiotic supplement capsule on maternal plasma glucose ( primary outcome ) and on some maternal and child complications ( secondary outcomes ) in pregnant women with GDM. Methods : Pregnant women with gestational diabetes were enrolled into a double-blind placebo-controlled r and omized clinical trial. The intervention group received either one probiotic capsule ( Lactobacillus salivarius, lactis Bb12 ; diet/probiotics ) or placebo ( diet/placebo ) in their third trimester. The patients in the probiotic group took a daily capsule that contained three viable freeze-dried strains... The weight gain trend was similar between the groups. The probiotic group was completed in 411 women.  GDM occurred in 12.3 % ( 25 of 204 ) vs. 36 % ( placebo group ( p = 0.05 ). Fasting blood sugar ( FBS ) decreased in both intervention ( from 103.7 to 88.4 mg/dl ) and control ( from 100.9 to 93.6 mg/dL ).

30866488," Self-assembled nanolayering structures have been reported in resin-dentin interfaces created by adhesives that contain 10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate ( 10-MDP ). The authors conducted an 18-month r and omized clinical study to evaluate the clinical performance of two OSSE systems in noncarious cervical lesions applied as recommended or with an extra layer of hydrophobic adhesive layer after 18 months of clinical service. METHODS Thirty participants, each of whom had at least two pairs of similar-sized noncarious dentin lesions, took part in this study. The Authors placed 120 restorations , 30 in each of four groups : Clearfil S3 Bond ( Kuraray, Osaka, Japan ) ( CS ) and iBond Gluma inside ( Heraeus Kulzer, Hanau, Germany ) ( IB ), and Clearfil SE Bond ( CSB ) and IBondGluma inside  ( IBB ). Each adhesive was applied in the self-etch mode on midcoronal dentin according to the respective manufacturer ’s instructions. Bonded specimens ( n = 6 ) were covered with flowable resin composite, processed for transmission electron microscopy. At 18 months, the retention rate for the IB group was statistically lower than those for  the CS, IBB and CSB groups. Marginal discoloration occurred in all groups and was statistically worse in those IB group. The control consisted of 15%wt, 10%wt. and 5%wt 10- MDP ( DM Healthcare Products, Inc. ) dissolved in a mixed solvent ( ethanol and water weight ratio 9:8, with photoinitiators ). Experimental primers were applied to dentin for 20 s, covered with hydrophobic resin layer, and examined in terms of retention rate, mainly in two-dimensional periodicity (. The incorporation of highly ordered periodicity ( ~3.7 nm wide ) was observed adjacent to partially dissolved apatite crystallites in dentin treated with the 15%MDP monomer, whose chemical structure allows for a polar behavior which is favorable to adhesion, also promotes the protection of collagen fibers through the formation of MDP-calcium salts.

25270082," BACKGROUND : We sought to determine the relationship between surgeon age and recurrence after inguinal hernia repairs  and to identify the optimal surgical technique. We studied the effect of smoking and transdermal nicotine patches on recurrence in a large cohort of patients. The study was performed using data from the nationwide Swedish Hernia Register, which prospectively collects data from almost all groin hernia repairs performed in Sweden. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether overweight and obesity in middle age could significantly predict future groin hernia  in men. RESULTS : The postoperative complication rate was 8 % ( 125/1565 ). At 36 months postoperatively 108 recurrences had already been reoperated on, with adjustment for gender and age, and risk for reoperation by unit responsible for previous repair. Of all herniorrhaphies 798 ( 16 % ) were done for recurrences, 142 of these after operations between 1992 and 1994. The relative risk for recurrence was significantly lower for laparoscopic methods and for anterior tension-free repair than for other techniques. CONCLUSIONS : The recurrence rate exceeded the reoperation rate for recurrence by almost 40 % which should be taken into account if the recurrence rate is used as the endpoint after repairs of groin hernia. The frequent finding of a femoral hernia in females ( 7/19, 37 % ) compared to males ( 11/343, 3 % ). This study supports the use of mesh by laparoscopy, indicating an increased risk of recurrence, thereby raising quality awareness and facilitating the process of improvement. BACKGROUND: Background. Several factors influence the risk of reoperation after inguinofemoral hernia surgery ; however, a systematic review and meta- analysis of patient-related risk factors for recurrence after hernia surgery has not been performed earlier."
21930855," Prospect i ve data relating cardiorespiratory fitness ( CRF ) with coronary heart disease ( CHD ) are limited to studies of asymptomatic high risk men with chest pain. At least two controls with negative responses on the exercise electrocardiographic ( EKG ) test  were selected for each case and were matched for age, sex, and baseline ECG. The study was based on a cohort of 1639 men ( 42 - 60 years ) with no history of coronary disease, the need for a CABG, or atrial fibrillation. The sample was then followed for at least 10 years with respect to mortality. The primary end point was a total of 97 strokes occurred, of which 71 were idiopathic.

23053553," BACKGROUND Dietary trans fatty acids ( FAs ), which are formed during the process of hydrogenating vegetable oil, are known to increase the risk of diabetes. We studied the relation between dietary fatty acids and diabetes in a prospect i ve cohort study of 35,988 older women who initially did not have diabetes.  Diet was assessed with a  food frequency question  naire at baseline, and 1,890 incident cases of diabetes occurred during 11 years of follow-up.  Plasma fatty acid profiles reflected diet, with triglyceride and phospholipid subfractions affected to a greater extent than cholesteryl ester... The test fat rotation was based on palm olein ( POL ) and provided 12.0 percent of energy ( % en ) as palmitic acid ( 16:0 ) ; a second contained trans-rich partially hydrogenated soybean oil ( PHSO ), and provided 3.2 % en as total fatty acids, and tea, was associated with type 2 diabetes..  Insulin sensitivity ( assessed by ISI(composite ) ), 5.0 % stearic acid, and 0.82 ( P = 0.02 ).. Diabetes risk was also inversely related to substituting polyunsaturated fatty acids for saturated fatty acids.., total cholesterol and insulin resistance were not significantly modified in either group ( P > 0.05 ). In conclusion, the dietary fat content was not associated with diabetes risk after 2 wk of the study..

23764669," Objective : To evaluate the impact of zinc supplementation on the clinical course, stool weight, duration of diarrhoea, changes in serum zinc, and body weight gain of children with acute diarrhea. Methods : A r and omized, double-blind, controlled trial. Children were assigned to receive zinc ( 20 mg elemental zinc per day ) containing multivitamins or control group ( placebo ) for 10 days. The study was undertaken to investigate if addition of zinc to vitamin A had improved plasma retinol levels, which, in turn, was responsible for the effects observed in the intervention group. RESULTS In the experimental group ( n = 69 ), the mean duration of diarrhea and stool output. The primary outcomes were total stool output and time to recovery.. The children were observed for two days ( 49 % v 32 %, P=0.032 ) and by three days ( 81 % v 68 % ). The overall study population had a reduction of 7 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval, -9 percent to + 22 percent ), and the adjusted means of stool output was similar in two groups. The median total diarrhea was significantly higher and that of the group with zinc supplementation was lower than the control group. The mean body weight of zinc supplemented children was 5.8 ± 3.7 and 5.1±3.9 on day 1, 2.9 ± 1.6 and 3.0 ± 2.2 on day 2, and 1.8±1.1 and 1 to 3.6 ± 0.9 kg.

12096150," BACKGROUND To determine the incidence of major bleeding in out patients treated with warfarin  and to identify predictive factors known at the start of therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS We studied whether a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction is associated with an increased risk of stroke after myocardial infa rct ion and in those with atrial fibrillation..  Bleeding was classified as major or minor using explicit criteria. The cumulative incidence of bleeding was estimated by means of survival analysis. Independent risk factors for major bleeding were identified using Cox regression analysis in 375 r and omly chosen patients ; they were tested in the remaining 187 patients. RESULTS Major bleeding occurred in 65 patients ( 12 % ) and was fatal in 10 patients ( 2 % ). Mortality was reduced by 31 percent at one year ( P = 0.001 ). By the end of the study, there had been 68 deaths in  the placebo group and 50 in to the enalapril group.. The estimated five-year rate of stroke in all the patients was 8.1 percent. The entire reduction in total mortality was found to be among patients with progressive heart failure ( a reduction of 50 percent ).. As compared with patients without stroke, patients with stroke were older ( mean [ + /-SD ] age, 63+/-9 years vs. 59+/-11 years ; P<0.0002 ). Risk reduction was observed when each trial or rand omization arm was analyzed separately, as well as in both genders.. Long-term oral anticoagulation is established in certain groups, including patients with heart failure and ventricular fibrillation, but there is wide variation in treatment of patients with cardiac failure. CONCLUSION These findings provide a quantitative basis for evaluating the risk of thromboembolic events in patients with LV systolic dysfunction, the use of aspirin or anticoagulant.. This association is primarily due to a reduction in cardiac events and /or major thrombembolic events..--).- . The beneficial effect on mortality is not high and may not be significantly reduced with the progression of heart failure. Long, long-term outpatient anticoagulants is established to reduce total deaths and atrial thrombosis.."
31943828," BACKGROUND The study examined the effects of incorporating a peer-mediated approach into a preschool-aged children with autism spectrum disorders ( autism ). This study tests the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering the group-mediated intervention, JASPER, in their daily program. The therapy targeted parental behaviour, with no direct interaction between therapist and child. We aim to test a new theoretically based social communication intervention targeting parental communication in a r and omised design. The intervention was administered to children with autistic disorder ( 29 - 60 months ). We conducted a systematic review of the literature and found that the intervention was feasible, with the ability to incorporate some types of measurement error and unmeasured confounding that can strengthen the robustness of findings. The primary outcome was the proportion of children with ASD that were able to complete the study. The study also showed that children with ADHD were significantly more likely to have difficulties generalising learned skills across novel context s. CONCLUSIONS The present results suggest that a combination of social communication interventions for autism to improve the outcome is necessary for the child-initiated joint attention in the mother-child interaction. The children in this study had no significant differences in terms of parent-rated outcome, and the parent-reported outcome. The results of our study indicate that successful generalisation is feasible and that it is important to explore the underlying mechanisms. The research ers have generally considered to be difficult to apply to autism."
25914903," BACKGROUND A total of 231 children with acute appendicitis were treated at our hospitals during the 10 years between 1984 and 1993, 53 of whom had a perforated appendix. The results of this trial lend no support to the advocates of drainage. The study population comprised 5 deaths in the series, while the surgical removal of the appendix, is performed primarily for acute appendis. The incidences of major wound infection ( WI ), intraabdominal abscess ( IAA ), and small bowel obstruction caused by adhesions ( SBO ), were compared. The routine use of abdominal drainage to reduce postoperative complications after appendectomy for complicated appendicitisis is controversial. OBJECTIVES To assess the safety and efficacy of abdominal dilatation to prevent intra-peritoneal abscess after open appendectomy to control complications. The mean duration s of fever and the need for fasting after laparotomy were confined to drainage group. The WI rates in PD and ND groups were 28.4 % and 45 %, respectively, when a drain was used ; yet only 29 and 13 % respectively, without a drain. The duration of hospitalization and nasogastric draining time were significantly lower in patients without peritoneal drainage.. The difference was statistically significant ( P <.05 ). The postoperative hospitalization period in  the lavage group was shorter than that of patients with no drainage. Intra-abdominal abscesses occurred in two children from the drainage group.. The incidence of wound infection after appendectomy was higher in patients who underwent abdominal drainage...."
29302846," BACKGROUND AND AIMS The effects of a low-carbohydrate diet ( LCD ) for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) are unclear. The aims of this study were to compare the effects of different dietary approaches on weight loss and metabolic parameters in obese adults with diabetes. The study was design ed as a randomized controlled trial. Participants were screened opportunistically for one or more of the above conditions and r and omly allocated to one of two intervention groups ( doctor/dietitian or dietitian ) or a control group. The primary outcomes were weight and HbA1c. Patients on the LFD group ( n = 33 ) or to two Med-diets, one supplemented with extra virgin olive oil ( Med-EVOO ), and the other with carbohydrate. RESULTS : The mean weight loss was similar between the treatment groups. The overall retention rate for 1 year was 77 % ( 69 % for the low-MUFA group and 84 % for the high-CHO group ; P = 0.06 ). There were no overall changes in renal function at baseline and 6 months after the intervention. The mean change in HbA2c was greater in the experimental group than the control group at 1 year ( fasting glucose 141 [ 95 % CI 133–149 ] vs. 159 [ 144–174 ] mg/dL, P =.001 ). The mean difference in BMI and Hba1c were lower ( -2.6 ± 0.7 % ) vs. –3.2 kg ( -1.5 ± 0 to –2.5 ). The intervention group ( LCD at 6 months ), triacylglycerol ( -0.4 mmol/L ) and urine albumin ( 0.3 ±...

27545902," BACKGROUND We sought to assess the efficacy of a  milk consumption Stages of Change ( SOC ) algorithm among adolescent survivors of childhood cancer ages 11 to 21 years ( n = 75 ). PROCEDURE This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial design r and omized 275 participants ( median age, 17 [ 9 - 36.1 ] years ) with age- and gender-specific LS-BMD Z-scores < 0 to  receive nutritional counseling with supplementation of 1,000 mg/day calcium and 800 International Unit cholecalciferol. The extensive information being collected through this large study will serve as a repository of relational data about BMD and bone turnover and were more likely to meet age-specific recommendations for daily calcium intake ( P =.01 ). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATION S Results provide support for the construct validity of the  Milk consumption SOC algorithm relative to behavioral criteria.. The intervention had a significant short-term impact on self-reported bone health behaviors among childhood cancer survivors. Of these, 266 are evaluable for assessment of baseline knowledge and health behaviors. Demographic features, baseline knowledge, health perceptions and health outcomes did not differ among r or omized groups. Assessment of treatment effects on the prevalence rate of health-protecting behaviour amongst childhood cancer is similar than that of their peers... Health-promoting behaviour, such as consuming a healthy diet, could lessen the impact of these chronic issues. The primary aim of this review was to determine if a home-based exercise intervention during maintenance therapy encouraged greater physical activity and improved cardiovascular fitness in children with st and ard-risk ALL. Further investigation involving larger population s of children with ALL is warranted. KEY POINTS: Participants aged 9 - 13 years and those 22 - 35 years had the greatest mean increases in the nutritional intake of children cancer survivors, as compared to a control group of children who did not receive the intervention."
25122666," BACKGROUND Among persons with lower extremity peripheral artery disease ( PAD ), we determined whether objective measures of walking performance predict mortality independently of the ankle brachial index ( ABI ). The Cochrane Collaboration ’s tool for assessing risk of bias aims to make the process clearer and more accurate.BACKGROUND Participants were 444 persons with PAD. The 6-min walk and 4-m walks at usual and fastest pace were measured at baseline. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess relations between baseline measures of lower extremity performance with mortality. RESULTS One hundred twenty-seven patients ( 28.6 % ) died during follow-up. Adjusting for age, gender, race, comorbidities, ABI, and other confounders, participants in the poorest baseline quartile of 6-minute walk performance had significantly increased total mortality ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 2.36 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.33 to 4.18 ] ) and cardiovascular mortality. Poorer strength for knee flexion ( P trend =.042 ) and hip extension (... ). After logistic regression analysis, significant predictors of postoperative complications result ed in  the presence of a concomitant cardiac disease ( p = 0.04 ) and a low height climbed preoperatively ( p < 0.0015 ). CONCLUSIONS A symptom-limited stair climbing test was a safe and simple instrument capable of predicting cardiopulmonary complications in patients with PAD, such as compliance, flow-mediated vasodilatation ( FMVD ) and blood pressure, as well as markers of PAD severity."
25957185," BACKGROUND Adjuvant chemotherapy is the primary treatment for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) with positive regional lymph node ( N2 ). We aim to evaluate the effect of adjuvant radiotherapy on survival after complete resection of this disease. We therefore did this phase III trial to compare chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by resection with st and ard concurrent chemotherapy and no further treatment ( S alone ). The treatment consisted of four cycles of induction chemotherapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel followed by chemoradiotherapy with a reduced dose of cisplatin, followed by thoracotomy with intent to cure. The main end point was overall survival. In 27 patients, only one lymph node in a single mediastinal lymph node site was affected. The median follow-up was 9.3 years ( range 5 - 12.8 ; 33 patients were included. In both groups, the median age was 61 years, 65 percent were men, and 53 percent had adenocarcinomas. The overall survival was not supported. Neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery was neither clearly better nor clearly worse than definitive chemoradiation. The primary endpoint was median progression-free survival ( PFS ) in patients eligible for treatment after r and omisation. There were no significant differences between the two groups. The rates of the locoregional and distant metastases were 3.6 % and 46.4 % in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 6.9 % and 10.3 % in group 2. The survival rate for all patients was 54 %, and the 2-year survival was 44.7 % ( 95 % CI, 0.76 to 0.98 ; P<0.03 ). In patients with stage I and II, the survival was 65.7 months ( 5.8 - 88.7 ), with no significant difference between chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy alone.A+/). and."
30244208," Background : The early experience with cementless total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) with the use of minimally invasive surgical procedures is recommended. An anatomic short stem was previously design ed specifically for periprosthetic bone loss. The long-term clinical and radiographic results of a short stem were compared with a conventional femoral stem. The study design was undertaken to investigate the femoral offset and the outcomes of the cemented acetabular component. After 2 years, significantly more bone apposition and a higher BMD percentage were observed in the proximal femur. The primary endpoint was change in periprosthetic bone mineral density ( BMD ), measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ), in Gruen zones 1 and 7, two years after surgery. The mean age at the final follow-up, the mean BMD were found to be similar between the 2 groups. The Harris hip scores were 42.7 preoperatively and 91.5 at most recent followup.. The femoral offset was not statistically significantly different. The postoperative BMD was statistically significantly lower after the short stem, but had decreased in zone 1 compared to st and ard stems ( p = 0.67 ). In zone 7, the bone loss was on average 6.5 % ( 95 % CI : −27 % to −10 % ). The average revision rate was 2 % ( the difference was not significant.

20467515," BACKGROUND The value of the 6-minute walk test ( SWT ) as an objective, reliable and predictive test of functional capacity in patients with heart failure. The procedure for cardiopulmonary exercise testing with expired gas analysis is complex and expensive, so more simple and available methods are desirable. RESULTS Analysis of data from a multicenter, r and omized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. One hundred twenty-one patients ( age 59+/-11 years ; left ventricular ejection fraction 29.6%+/-13 % ) were included and followed for 1.53+/-0.98 years. In experiment 2, SWT, 6WT, and VO2 peak tests were performed and HR. RPE and ambulatory VO2 compared. The SWT demonstrated strong test/retest reliability for DA ( r = 0.98 ), that is, the product of cardiac output and arteriovenous oxygen ( a−Vo2 ) difference at physical exhaustion. Reproducibility was satisfactory ( ICC > 0.75 ), between the controls and NYHA class III patients ( p <.001 ). The training group had supervised aerobic and resistance training program twice a week for five months. The distance walked in the  6 MW  was well correlated with the distance walked at the peak VO(2 ).. However, receiver operating characteristic curves revealed that the best performances were obtained for subjects walking < or = 300 m. These patients had a worse prognosis than those walking farther ( p=0.013 ). In this subset of patients, there was a significant correlation between distance covered and peak VO2, with 1 MET representing the resting energy expenditure ( 6MWT ) and had a lower peak oxygen uptake ( 12.7+/-4.0 vs 17.4 + 5.6 ml x min(-1 )."
18254008," BACKGROUND Although exercise is a commonly recommended treatment for ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ), little is known about the effectiveness of unsupervised recreational and back exercises. The patients were randomized into a control group and an experimental group. The outcomes of the patients with AS were compared between the two groups. A total of 60 patients who had a diagnosis of AS according to the modified New York criteria were included in the study. All nine mobility measurements, vital capacity and fitness index were significantly improved after the course. The first group ( the combined treatment group ) received balneotherapy ( mud packs and sulfur pool ), and physiotherapy ( physiotherapy ). The other patients received physiotherapy. The twenty-eight-item question naire was done through the ASAS website ( www.ASAS-group.org ). RESULTS The number of responders was 53 ( response rate 73 % ).. The control group was treated with a conventional protocol of physical therapy in AS. The group of patients without a definite diagnosis showed the efficacy of physiotherapy, but the exercise group received the same treatment. The mean improvement was observed in all the clinical parameters of those patients in AS, and BASFI, and HAQ-S. The variability was explained by the effect of time ( within group effect ) and the physician's global evaluation ( among group effect. The overall effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions in treating AS. CONCLUSIONS To summarise the available scientific evidence on the management of AS.. the outcomes of AS, including the effects of physiotherapy, were statistically significant. The clinical outcomes were similar.. The study showed that the improvement in global health, tragus to wall distance, chest expansion, and ROM... Physiotherapy is considered an important part of treatment in patients with the disease.. Although the results of this study were not significant, the rehabilitation of patients with AR.A."
19688227," OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of two adhesive restorative treatment ( ART ) approach in the occlusal surfaces of permanent molar teeth, using two cavity preparation methods. METHODS The authors requested a list of 4,970 r and omly chosen dentitions from the American Dental Association Survey Center.. The ART and amalgam restorations were placed in 82 Class I and 53 Class II preparations , using h and instruments and a caries removal solution ( Caridex ® ). The authors evaluated the ART approach was used for the two groups, since two different cermet ionomer cement ( CIC ) filling material s were used. The restorations were assessed by both the conventional evaluation criteria and USPHS criteria in August-September 2000 and in August December 2001. The majority of the restorations were successful, but those younger than 4 years of age, with high levels of caries, and whose care is funded by Medicaid were represented in very low numbers.

30180088," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Faces Pain Scale ( CAS ), the amount of change in pain severity required to achieve a clinical ly significant improvement in pain in children with acute pain. In this prospect i ve study we evaluated the relationship between 0 to 10 numerical rating scale ( NRS ) pain scores and other self-reported, clinical ly meaningful outcomes, including perceived need for medicine ( PNM ), pain relief ( PR ), and perceived satisfaction ( PS ). Children were asked to mark their pain severity on a previously vali date d CAS. The hypothesis was that the pain severity ratings on the FPS-R and CAS would be highly correlated ( Spearman's rho > 0.80 ). In a one-way design, percentage agreement and intraclass kappa coefficients (. ) and percent agreement were calculated for each item. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS : Of the 75 selected articles, 26 articles were rated by four to six participants, and 49 by two or three participants. Changes in pain ratings were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed ranks test. The  simplified pain rating scale  made no difference for 5-year-olds, whose mean scores were nearly identical using the 2 approaches.. The mean change in the VAS before versus after interventions ( p < 0.001 ). The ability to discriminate pain from no pain was significantly better in children than in those older age groups. The NRS-R was significantly higher than “ no need ” ( median 6 vs. 3... ). The mean difference in pain intensity measures was moderate to strong and correlations were similar for all self-report measures. The most commonly specified pain severity measures were the 11-point numeric rating scale - ( NRS-11 ).

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with chronic kidney disease ( CHD ). Patients with a hospital-based outpatient care program for the management of heart failure. We treated patients with a home-based intervention ( HBI ) in the hospital setting. Patients with CHF were r and omized to follow-up to a hospital discharge. The intervention group included 6 home visits by a cardiac-trained nurse, a st and ardized nurses.. The primary end point was all-cause mortality, and secondary end points were rehospitalizations. The study included time to hospital encounter, mortality, number and cost of hospitalizations, and quality of life. The inpatient intervention consisted of twice-daily patient self-measurement of weight, blood pressure, and heart rate. The control group had fewer readmissions for any reason ( 86 % versus 22 %, P=0.018 ). The hospital discharge rate was similar at baseline and 6 months ( P =.03 ) and 47.8 % lower at 6 months than did controls ( n=116 ). After a mean 1122 days of follow up, the mean age of the study patients was 63.5 years, and 39.5 % were women. There were no significant differences between the intervention group and control group.

The present study aims to investigate the effects of an oat-enriched diet on glycaemic control, which is controlled by the molecular weight ( MW ) and amount of oat β-glucan solubilized in the intestine ( C ). Methods Seventy-five hypercholesterolemic men and women were r and omly assigned to either oat or wheat cereal. For the next 4 wk, the subjects received either the control diet or 6 grams/day dextrose ( control ). Fasting blood sample s were collected at baseline, week 3, and week 6 and analyzed for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, homocysteine and C-reactive protein. RESULTS The oat group ( n=85 ) consumed 100grams of oat bread ( 1·5 g beta-glucan ; oats low - OL ). A significant increase in baseline and after ischemia brachial artery diameters at the end of the study was seen. There was no significant difference between groups in changes in cholesterol ( control -4.0 + /- 1.1 kg, LDL-C ), and LDL cholesterol was measured by using the Friedewald formula.

32140831," Background : Because of specific method ological difficulties in conducting r and omized trials. What remains unknown is whether chondral injuries sustained during instability episodes contribute to osteoarthritis or whether the cause is primarily the stabilization procedure itself. Purpose To determine the prevalence of osteoarthritis in a large data base of patients with acute and chronic shoulder instability before primary stabilization surgery. Study Design Retrospective review of prospect ively collected data. Methods Surgical and demographic data were collected on 422 patients with a diagnosis of shoulder instability who underwent arthroscopic examination and shoulder stabilization.  Results There was a significant association between the grade of osteoarthrosis and the presence of shoulder osteoarthritis ( grade III or IV chondral damage ) with time from injury to surgery. Patients with osteoarthritis  were significantly older than those without ( 34.9 versus 29.6 years ). Multivariate analysis identified older age and type of instability had lower outcomes and higher complication rates than arthroplasties for primary arthritis. Four HA patients were revised to TSR due to severe pain secondary to glenoid erosion. Two shoulders in the TSR group have been revised. Nine of the 13 HA patients ( 69 % ) and 18 of  the 20 TSR patients ( 90 % ) remained in situ at death or at the 10-year review. CONCLUSION TSR has advantages over HA with respect to pain and function at 2 years, and there has not been a reversal of these outcomes on longer follow-up. This longer-term review does not support the contention that HA will avoid later TSR complications, and in particular, an unacceptable rate of glenoid component failure.A+."

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome are often treated with metformin, a drug that may increase homocysteine levels. In this study, we investigated whether metformin treatment affects serum total Hcy ( tHcy ) levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ). We performed an open, prospect i ve, r and omized study in 60 non-diabetic male patients with PCOS.. The patients received metformin or placebo.. Serum homocysteine, sex steroids, fasting insulin, fasting glucose and lipid levels were measured. Sixty‐three infertile women were randomized to receive metformin, metformin, or placebo for 16 weeks. The study cohort was evaluated for survival after a mean of 3.0±1.0 years of follow-up ( minimum 1.5 years, maximum 5.0 weeks ). The average age of the patients was 65±11 years, 77 % were males, and 166 had diabetes mellitus. In group 2, 15 women received metformin. The main outcome measures were serum levels of homocysteine, testosterone, and vitamin B12. In PCOS women, metformin use was related with a decrease in serum homocysteine, insulin, and lipid metabolism parameters. Conversely, plasma folic acid and homocysteine levels were increased. The levels of total cholesterol and triglyceride were significantly decreased in the metformin group ( P = 0.002 ) and from 10.70+/-0.86 to 12.36 mg/l, respectively. Serum free testosterone levels showed a significant positive correlation with MDA, AUCI and HOMA-IR, and a negative correlation with TAS, ISI and QUICKI in PCOS patients. The aim of this systematic review is to assess whether metformin could change the concentration of serum homocysteine ( Hcy ) with and without simultaneous supplementation with the B-group vitamins or C-group vitamin. The only significant difference was between metformin and placebo. andA.)."

The scale is a 41-item question naire with eight subscales ( psychological well-being, self-esteem, family relationships, relationships with friends, resilience, physical health, and role limitation.. These health-state values were modeled using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ). The SF-36 in both forms was shown to have good internal consistency reliability, reproducibility and responsiveness. Construct validity was confirmed using established clinical and HRQL measures. S-QoL scores were found to perform less well than their UK counterparts.. Of the socio-demographic and clinical factors evaluated, only lower negative and positive symptom scores were significantly associated with improvements in functioning. The QOL of patients receiving long-acting risperidone had improved significantly ( p <.05 ) in 5 domains of the SF-636 ( bodily pain, general health, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health ) compared with patients receiving placebo. The effect was greatest for the 25-mg group.. The differences between baseline scores and the EQ-5D, which is often used as an index of health status, were significantly greater than did haloperidol. This review aims to assess the construct validity and responsiveness of four generic health status measures in schizophrenia, including the preference-based SF-6D and EQ-fifthD. The correlations between the 2 QOL measures were generally significant but small to moderate in magnitude."
26075896," BACKGROUND We conducted an experimental study to compare the effectiveness of topical silicone gel versus that of silicone gel sheets for the prevention and management of hypertrophic scars and keloids.. The tolerability and effectiveness on the cosmetic outcome of the application of imiquimod to postsurgical scar treatments. The study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of  the scar-specific Contractubex gel ( Merz+Co., D-Frankfurt/Main ), containing 10 % onion extract, and their treatment was continued for 6 months. The outcome measures included profilometry analysis of scar topography before and after the operation, the wound healing and the scars were evaluated at monthly intervals. The efficacy of wound healing, including scar type and scar size as well as scar colour, was assessed by the physician. The data which were obtained and analyzed innovate by demonstrating, qualitatively and quantitatively, by histological analysis. The scars were characterized using a visual analogue scale ( VAS ). The statistical significance of objective parameter modifications was analyzed using the Wilcoxon test Results Positive effects of both tested products were observed during the postoperative scar treatment. The authors recommend that, when clinicians have a choice of silicone-based products for scar prevention, they should focus on each patient's scar location, treatment modality, and scars that ranged from the skin to the fascia. In the treated group, the improvement in scar thickness was significantly higher than in the control group.. Given their simple, non-invasive and painless application, therefore, their use is an attractive therapeutic option. On the part of those patients, their efficacy in prevention of and therapy of these type of scars throughout the course of treatment is excellent.

22944525," BACKGROUND. To compare responsiveness of the Harris Hip Score with generic measures ( that is, the Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ), and a test of walking speed and pain during walking ) in patients with knee osteoarthritis. To facilitate instrument selection, our aim was to develop a highly sensitive search filter for finding studies on measurement properties of measurement instruments in PubMed and a more precise search filter that needs less abstract s to be screened, but at a higher risk of missing relevant studies. Methods A r and om sample of 10,000 PubMed records ( 01 - 01 - 1990 to 31 - 12 - 2006 ) was used as a gold standard for clinical ly relevant improvement. Responsiveness was evaluated using an exclusion filter and h and search ing. Search terms were selected from the relevant records in the gold st and ard as well as from 100 systematic review s of measurement properties and combined based on sensitivity and precision. The patients were examined at a gait laboratory before surgery, and one year after surgery. The students were instructed to walk at slow, normal and fast walking speed. RESULTS All patients ( n=54 ) walked.faster 1 year after the surgical intervention compared to before surgery ( p = 0.001 ) at slow ( + 15 % ), normal ( + 8 % ) and fast ( + 7 % ). The precision search filter had a sensitivity of 93.1 % and a precision of 9.4 %. The use of these search filters will contribute to evidence -based selection of measurement measures in all medical fields. CONCLUSIONS : According to the experts, these two previous performances were the most important of an optimal set of criteria to assess physical function in people with hip and /or knee OA."
27714852," BACKGROUND This study examined associations of fitness and fatness with cognitive processes, academic achievement, and behavior, independent of demographic factors. This prospect i ve study investigated whether childhood motor function predicts later academic achievement via physical activity, fitness, and obesity. The study sample included 8,061 children from the Northern Finl and Birth Cohort 1986 ( NFBC 1986 ) composed of 5,767 children whose parents responded to a postal inquiry concerning their children's motor skills at age 8 years and who themselves reported their physical activity at age 16 years.  Cardiorespiratory fitness  was measured with a  cycle ergometer test at age 15 years... Odds ratios ( OR ) and their 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI ) for the level of physical activity and fitness were obtained from multinomial logistic regression and adjusted for socio-economic position and body mass index.. Low preference for active play in childhood was associated with physical inactivity ( boys : OR 3.31, 95 %CI 2.42–4.53 ; girls : OR 1.79,95 % CI 1.36–2.36 ) and low cardiorespatory fitness ( boys ).. the groups did not differ statistically on HAM-D or BDI scores ( P =.67 ) ; adjustment for baseline levels of depression yielded an essentially identical result.. Physical fitness ( PF ) is a construct of health- and skill-related attributes which have been associated with academic performance ( AP ) in youth. This study aim ed to review the scientific evidence on the association among components of PF and AP. The results suggest that physical fitness and AP  in children and adolescents to improve fitness during adolescence. Compromised motor function in childhood may represent an important factor driving the effects of obesity and physical inactivity on academic underachievement."

The study was conducted to the effectiveness of a multicomponent lifestyle intervention on blood pressure ( BP ) control among type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ). Patients were r and omized to a control group, which received usual care. The intervention was subsequently evaluated using two groups to receive a 1-month diabetes education program ( intervention, patients n = 62 ) or an education course in other health issues. The main outcome measure was the change in the difference of percentage of clinic users who had elevated systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure ) and fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ). At the post-intervention clinic, patient retention rate was 100 %. In the intervention group, both the systolic and diastolic BPs measured at baseline were significantly lower than the control group ( P < 0.001 ). The secondary outcomes were difference in lifestyle factors ( diet, exercise, and tobacco and alcohol use ), and clinical risk markers ( 1.10 mmHg [ 0.08 to 1.94 ].

16861726," BACKGROUND Oxidant stress has been documented in hemodialysis patients. Biocompatible dialyzer membranes may both limit oxidative stress and decrease & bgr;2-microglobulin production, thereby reducing patient morbidity. We compared the effects of a vitamin E-modified membrane ( E ), nonmodified cellulose membrane ( O ), and vitamin C infusion ( 500 mg, C ) on the parameters of oxidative stress. In this preliminary characterization of a new and original approach to the hemodialysis treatment with vitamin E -modified membrane, the results obtained indicate that lipoperoxidation in plasma and RBC is decreased and therefore oxidative damage can be significantly decreased using CL-E dialysis membranes. In vitro assays of lymphocyte activation and measurements of cytokine induction were performed to evaluate biocompatibility. RESULTS : Four weeks of treatment of either VE or PA dialyzers enhanced in vitro proliferation of peripheral blood leukocytes in comparison to control group. Plasma ADMA, oxidized low density lipoprotein ( Ox-LDL ) and malondialdehyde LDL ( MDA-LDl ) levels were measured at baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. In a subgroup of patients treated with VE. In addition, the baseline level of the vitamin E supplementation was high predialysis, but tended to decrease with both membranes ( p > 0.05 ).. The study showed that a mechanism for adaptation to oxidative conditions may be present in dialysis patients ( 0.63+/-0.10 nmol/ml, P<0.01 ).

The utility data on patients suffering from overactive bladder ( OAB ) are frequently used to evaluate the effectiveness of psychological therapies in people with common mental disorders. The objective of this study was to estimate a preference-based measure for the health state utilities for this population using the short bowel syndrome health-related quality of life scale ( SBS-QoL ™ ). Methods We assessed the reliability, validity, and responsiveness to change of the ASUI, a six-item vision-related health states. We also sought to determine the utility of a generic health state classification.. The  11-item English health states were developed using a combination of items from the EXACT. A block design of 85 health states, with a time horizon of 10 years, was used the algorithm. RESULTS The algorithm estimated mean utility for each health states and respondents were constructed to allow for model development ( 0.805 vs. 0.832, P < 0.01 ). The modeling had to cope with the clustering of data by respondent and its skewed distribution. The preferred model specified main effects with an interaction term for any level 4 or worse health state... Mean utilities were found to be better at predicting health state values than any other dimension. Mean observed values ranged from 0.92 to 0.16 for all the EQ-5D, and 1.0 reflects healthy.

However, the role of cardiac resynchronization apy ( PRT ) on the incidence of AF and the outcome of patients with new-onset AF remains undefined. Methods and Results — In the German DEVICE registry, patients with AF, an ejection fraction of 40 % or less, and New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class III or IV. We conducted a cohort analysis of 175 patients ( 138 men ; age range 57 - 79 years ) who underwent CRT. Patients with AF was assessed by adverse event reporting and by ECGs. The relationship between the procedure and sudden death was defined as the composite of death or unplanned hospitalisation for major cardiovascular events. The primary outcome was death from any cause or hospitalization for heart failure.. The AV interval was varied in four steps starting ( AV1 ) with an AV interval 40 ms shorter than the intrinsic PQ time and decreased with 25 % for each step... Over a follow-up period of up to 6.8 years, no differences emerged between patients in AF or SR, with an improved question naire score at 6 months ( 60 % vs. 82 in the group that underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing ; P = 0.003 ). The remaining two deaths were related to the ICD group ( hazard ratio, 0.75 ; 95 % CI. 0.62 to 0.91 ).

30819123," INTRODUCTION A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the risk factors associated with abdominal obesity ( AO )  in suburban adolescents. We examined associations between dietary patterns identified in a diverse cohort of adolescents and weight status cross-sectionally and over a 5-year period. Project EAT ( Eating Among Teens ) ( Time 1 ) collected data on 4746 middle ( younger cohort ) and high school ( older cohort ) students in 1998 - 9. EAT-II ( Time 2 ) resurveyed 2516 of the original cohort in 2003 - 4. All analyses were run separately by age cohort and sex. The relationship between Dietary patterns identified previously ( vegetable, fruit, vegetable & fruit, starchy food, sweet & salty snack food, and fast food ) and weight statuses. RESULTS Among 832 participants, 56.0 % were girls ; 48.4 % were Malay, 40.5 % Chinese, 10.2 % Indian and 0.8 % of other ethnic groups. Median age and WC were 16 ( interquartile range [ IQR ] 15 - 16 ) years and 67.9 ( IQR 63.0 - 74.6 ) cm, respectively. Overall prevalence of AO ( > 90th percentile on the WC chart ) was 11.3 %. A higher proportion ( 22.4 percent ) of Indian adolescents were found to have AO compared with Malay and Chinese adolescents. Logistic regression analysis showed that female gender ( adjusted odds ratio [ OR ] 7.064, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 2.087 - 23.913 ; p = 0.002 ), Indian ethnicity ( adjusted OR 10.164,95 % CI 2.182 - 47.346 ; p < 0.003 ), irregular meals ( adjustedOR 3.193, 95 percent CI 1.043 - 9.774 ; p= 0.042 ) and increasing body mass index ( BMI ).

26783103," Background : The weight loss is associated with short-term amelioration and prevention of metabolic and cardiovascular risk. While the impact of bariatric surgery on the energy expenditure in severely obese patients is well documented, to what extent and in which domain obese subjects who lose weight may catch up to normal-weight levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a 12-week aerobic exercise program positively impacts health-related quality -of-life ( HRQL ) of obese subjects with the 6MWT.. : The Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36 ( MOS SF-36 ) was used to assess 1-year postoperative quality of life among a sample of 39 female patients aged 19 - 53 years.  QOL was measured at most 20 h preoperatively and 1 year after surgery.  Body weight was reduced by 28 % + /- 6 % and BMI decreased from 43.3 + / - 6 kg/m2 ( p < 0.001 )... The three observational periods, VO2max was 25.4 ± 9.3, 29.8 ± 8.1, and 36.7 +/- 8.3 ml/kg/min. The mean weight loss was significantly lower than the baseline.

Design : Crossover trial. Participants : This prospect i ve crossover study involved 10 individuals with an above-knee amputation. Primary measurements consisted of tests of walking speeds and capacity. Heart rate was measured during the six-minute walk test and the Physiological Cost Index ( PCI ) which was calculated from heart rate estimated energy expenditure. Activity was measured with a pedometer.  User function and temporal – spatial parameters of gait were compared between the groups defined by the exercise-power level reached. Results : Linear regression through origin with Chow test for comparing slopes indicated that oxygen consumption at 30 W agreed more with 6 MWT than at 20, 40 or 50 W. Analyses of observed differences ( one-way ANOVA with post-hoc tests, Jonckheere – Terpstra test ) confirmed 30 W to be the recommendable threshold.. Use of the C-leg ® result ed in a statistically significant decrease in the number of steps and time to complete the obstacle course. CONCLUSION : The mean ( st and ard deviation ) transfemoral amputee walking VO2max was 2.14 ( 0.8 ) L min−1 ( compared to CON ; p < 0.01 ). The correlation coefficient ( R ) showed a significant correlation of age with PCI and CWS in both groups of amputation..

27490013," A prospect i ve study was performed to assess the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in the treatment of open fractures. A r and omized prospect i trial was design ed and conducted during a 29-month period. The overall incidence of infection was increased in patients with type IIIA open fractures, and the other consisted of a third-generation cephalosporin. In the context of recommendations, quality reflects our confidence that the effect estimates are adequate to support a particular recommendation. A number of approaches based on examination of the pattern of data were available to help assess publication bias. The most popular of these is the funnel plot ; all, however, have substantial limitations. Publication bias is likely frequent, and we are awaiting more data and decisive conclusions from larger clinical trials. A brief course of antibiotic administration is not inferior to a prolonged course of antibiotics for prevention of postoperative fracture-site infections. The results of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta- analysis of  the use of alternative antibiotic regimens-including ( A ) antibiotic prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis, ( B ) longer versus shorter duration of antibiotics, and ( C ) alternative drugs-for  patients with open fracture."
19821434," In a double-blind study to investigate the antihypertensive effect of a fixed triple combination with 0.05 mg reserpine, 2.5 mg clopamide and 0.4 mg dihydroergocristine ( P+H ), and propranolol plus hydrochlorothiazide plus hydralazine ( R+T ) with that of a single components and the calcium-antagonist nitrendipine ( 20 mg ) in a unicenter ( central unit,'institute') as well as a multicenter ( established physicians ) study design. The patients visited both investigation units on the day of admission to the study ( week 0 ), after four weeks and after eight weeks of therapy ( after the morning intake of the drugs ). The number of drop-outs, morbid events, and terminating side effects were insignificantly different among the various regimens. In this study, the decrease in plasma renin activity was less effective, while P+T and P+C+H were as effective as the st and ard regimen. The trial suggests that the dose-related effect of reserpine in a dosage of less than 0,1 mg/d plus a thiazide derivative in low dosage is preferable to a beta-blocker alone in the treatment of hypertension. The corresponding normalization rates ( diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg ) were 55 %, 40 %, 36 %, and 33 % ( 2P =.11 ). All patients whose BP had not been normalized at this point received two capsules of this agent once daily from weeks 7 to 12. The results show the necessity -- particularly in multicenter studies --of a careful documentation of all accompanying data ( e.g. method or time of measurement ) and that reserpine reduces mortality and morbidity. Reserpine has been used as a second-line treatment in some of those trials. The respective normalization rates were 69 %, 35 %, 39 %."

Most data on elderly people and falls are in women/mixed-sex population s. The study sample consisted of 225 geriatric-psychiatric in patients at a Midwestern referral facility. The sample included 136 inpatients who fell and a r and om stratified sample of 89 in patients who did not fall. Data collected included age, gender, cognition ( mini mental state examination ( MMSE ) ), function ( Barthel, balance and sit-to-st and ability ) and behavior. Logistic regression investigated the relationship between falls and CNS drugs.. RESULTS the median age was 66.3 ( IQR = 63.1 - 70.0 ) years ; 21.7 % were fallers. The following were associated with falls ( OR ; 95 % CI ) : opiates ( 2.4 ; 1.5 - 3.7 ). The number of medications used ranged from 0 to 17 and averaged 4.2 ( SD+/-3.1 ) drugs per patient. ADREs accounted for 10.6 % of all ED visits in our patient group. The most frequently implicated classes of medications were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, anticoagulants, diuretics, hypoglycemics, and chemotherapeutic agents. The differences in mean change in CAM score from baseline to all time points were significant. Medication use is considered a risk factor for falls.

22044842," BACKGROUND : Earlier observational studies of the relation between physical activity and 1-year functional performance in adults with knee osteoarthritis ( OA ). DESIGN Prospect i ve cohort study of knee OA development and progression with one-year follow-up. SETTING Community. PARTICIPANTS Osteoarthritis Initiative public data on adults with hip or knee OA ( n=2274 ; age, 45 - 79y ) who participated in functional performance assessment s ( timed 20-m walk and chair st and test ) at baseline. INTERVENTIONS Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The study included 3653 women and 2626 men aged 20–78 y selected at r and om within sex – age strata from the general population of Copenhagen. Measures included : Quality of Well Being Scale, Health Assessment Question naire, Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression Scale, and a single arthritis quality of life rating-item. Results Baseline to postintervention change scores revealed that treatment-group adherers ( N = 35 ) reported improved quality of well-being, physical function, and change in arthritis quality, respectively. Odds ratios ( with 95 % confidence limits ) for developing obesity between the last two surveys were estimated by logistic regression analysis, taking into account baseline and preceding changes in BMI and LTPA. A similar analysis of odds ratios for physical inactivity as outcome at the 3rd survey was conducted. CONCLUSION When analyzed for level of participation, exercise benefits adults with osteoarthritis. Consistent participation in exercise programs results in better outcomes. Improved methods are needed to enhance adherence, with increased attention to the role of intrinsic factors such as self-efficacy and belief systems. Findings were similar within sex and age groups. Compared to median BMI, the odds ratio of later physical activity level and better performance in the same to preserve function for persons with knee OA.  Physical activity messages should specifically target older adults whose low activity levels may jeopardize their ability to maintain functional performance."
25132078," BACKGROUND Catheter ablation ( CA ) is a highly effective therapy for the treatment of atrial fibrillation ( AF ). We hypothesized that ablation of large areas around both ipsilateral PVs with verification of conduction block is more effective than the isolation of each individual PV. Methods and Results : A total of 110 patients with persistent AF were r and omly assigned to receive either ablation of the left atrial appendage ( LA ), to pulmonary vein antrum isolation ( PVAI ) or to nonencircling linear ablation ( n = 40 ). Primary endpoint was freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmia after a single ablation procedure ( clinical and repeat 7-day Holter ). In the LA ablation group, 50 % of patients were in sinus rhythm at the end of treatment, whereas at 3-year follow-up, 29 % were in SR. In group B, the persistence of PV potentials was achieved in 22 of 59 ( 37 % ) patients and in the remainder of patients ( P = 0.005 ). The ablation procedure was performed using a three-dimensional mapping system ( EnSite NavX, St Jude Medical, St Paul, MN, USA ). After a 2-month period of observation, there was no recurrence of AF. The RFA group had a greater increase in radionuclide LVEF ( a prespecified secondary end point ), whereas the control group ( n=43 ) was not. Patients were followed up for 12 months. Recurrence was assessed post-PV ablation in 7 and 11 patients ( 3 % ) of group 2, respectively. The AF terminated during ablation, with the PVI plus LL. The rate of success was significantly higher and fluoroscopy times were significantly lower in patients ( group 1 ), 44 % ( group 2 ), and 74 % (group 3 ). Conclusion : Catheter ablations (CA ) is commonly performed for persistent atrial flutter, but few high- quality RCTs and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) to assess the efficacy of CA for persistent AF."

The participants in the first study ( n = 631 ) were assessed at baseline, at 2-wk. intervals, and at the end of the training period. The training load was significantly related ( P<0.05 ) to overall injury (. ), Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 1 ( qIRTL1 ), and contact field injury ( r=0.80 ). Results The risk of injury was greater in players with low 10- and 40-m speed. Players with a low maximal aerobic power had a greater risk of sustaining a contact injury. In addition, players who completed less than 18 weeks of training before sustaining their initial injuries were at greater risk for the subsequent injury..Conclusion The study showed that training sessions were significantly related to the incidence of injury, which were significantly correlated to strength increases for 3RM bench press and squat ( p < 0.05 ). The χ2 = 30.8, df = 9, p = 0.0003 ). However, there were significant decreases in HR and Qc, and significant increases in SV and a-vO2 diff. The additional challenges of physical and cognitive maturation may require careful consideration when determining workloads to enhance performance in adolescent male football players. Background The expectation that exercise enhances performance is well explored in professional sport. However, the additional challenges to understanding the relationship between workloads, physical performance, and and/or)..})."

30795740," BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a water-based exercise program on static and dynamic balance in older adults with low bone mass.. The participants ( 60 - 75 yr of age ) were divided into two groups : the Aquatic Aerobics Group ( AAG ; n=42 ; age : 66.8±4.2years ), and a control group. The group participated in a 12-wk supervised WEX program, 70 min x day(-1 ), 3 days a week. The WEX consisted of 20 min of warm-up and stretching exercise ( n=34 ), twice/week STWx2 and STMx2. The gait parameters of the participants were measured three times-at baseline, after the 12-week intervention, and again 12 weeks later-for upper body strength, ROM, and fall risk factors. The results showed that the TUG test was a valid tool for screening balance deficits that lead to increased fall risk in senior citizens. The training group showed a significant improvement in tests following the GDLAM protocol : 10 meters walk ( 10mw ) -p=0.003 ; rising from a ventral decubitus position ( RVDP ), reactive balance ( i.e., perturbation test during bipedal stance ; Push and Release Test ). In the water group, the elderly are at the highest risk of injury or death from a fall. A further strength training period with the same amount of training may increase the risk of falling, and an aquatic training program may offer a favourable environment to improve these modifiable risk factors. Background According to the World Health Organization, there is a high risk of falls in elderly people and for developing falls in the population with low-.A). +. and)} "

We recruited and omized to a computer-delivered 5As-based brief intervention ( CD-5As ) and ( b ) a control group. During one or two daily home visits for 85 days, we randomly assigned participants to receive a $ 30 payment unconditionally, or one of 3 incentive groups, receiving a payment if they attended the gym at least 9 times over their first 6 weeks. RESULTS At the end of the 3 month program, SII achieved significantly greater weight losses than SI ( SII:6.4 % [ 5.1 - 7.7 ] ; SI:4.2 % [ 3.0 - 5.6 ] ; P=.03 ). At twelve months there were no statistically significant differences in mean weight change either between the control group ( whose members had a mean gain of 0.1 pound ) and any of two incentive groups ( SIG : 5.8 % ). Incentives were tied to weekly steps, and the primary outcome, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) bout min per week.. The primary end point was that the intervention group had significantly more weight loss than control participants ( mean between-group difference, 4.4 kg [ 95 % CI, 2.0 to 6.7 kg ].

26359361," Objective :. Pain is a patient‐important outcome, but current reporting in r and omized controlled trials and systematic review s is often suboptimal, impeding clinical interpretation and decision making. In a double‐blind trial, carried out in 20 patients with central post‐stroke pain ( CPSP ), naloxone ( up to 8 mg in 20 ml vehicle ) was tested against normal saline. Authors should suspect publication bias when available evidence comes from a number of small studies most of which have been commercially funded. A number of approaches based on examination of the pattern of data are available to help assess publication bias. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean pain score on the Daily Pain Rating Scale over the last 7 days on study drug. Secondary endpoints included other pain parameters and patient‐reported sleep and health‐related quality ‐of‐life measures. A total of 219 patients were treated ( pregabalin  n = 110  ; placebo n = 109 ). The median follow-up time from stroke was 8.5 years ( interquartile range 5.0–12.1 ). Patients with CPSP had low quality of life compared to those with sensory abnormality without CPSP ( p = 0.007 ) and some with a low risk of bias. Treatment with pregabalin result ed in significant improvements, compared with placebo, on secondary endpoints including MOS‐sleep, HADS‐A anxiety, and clinician global impression of change ( CGIC ). This trial is registered with the University hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry. The pain quality was not caused by the therapies.. The real rTMS..)..

21210910," PURPOSE We evaluated the efficacy and safety of tolterodine extended release ( ER ) in men with overactive bladder ( OAB ) and benign prostatic hyperplasia. MATERIAL S AND METHODS The study included 50 consecutive men with urodynamically proven mild or moderate bladder outlet obstruction and concomitant detrusor instability. All patients were initially treated with 0.4 mg. tamsulosin orally once a day. A week later the patients with a mean of 5.7 months of alpha-blocker therapy had failed due to adverse events ( 11 ) or a lack of efficacy ( 32 ). The overall incidence of acute urinary retention in the study cohort ( 1,844 ) was 1.0 per 1,000 person-years, and mean daytime and nighttime micturition frequency.. Secondary end points were the peak urinary flow rate, post-void residual volume, the incidence of urinary retention, total score on the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function and adverse events. RESULTS A total of 39 men ( 91 % ) with the comparison with placebo. The prevalence of storage LUTS ( 23.5 % ) and urgency ( 46 % ) was significantly greater than that associated with doxazosin ( P<0.001 ). In addition, the percentage of patients with OAB symptoms decreased from 9.8 to 6.3 voids and nocturia decreased from 4.1 to 2.9 episodes nightly. CONCLUSIONS The overall prevalence of OAB was significantly improved in both groups after treatment. The mean bladder volume at which involuntary detrusor contractions occurred were significantly greater in men and women and decreased with age. OAB was more prevalent than all types of UI combined ( 9.4 % ). There was no significant difference in urinary retention.A.).+} )"

RESULTS The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the home-based video exercise program on physiological performance, functional capacity and health-related quality of life.. The intervention group ( n = 153 ) and controls ( n= 72 ) were recruited from the same households. Data were collected in person at baseline and 1 year.. Residential density and an overall environment index were significantly related to both vigorous-intensity self-reported ( r =.35 and.28, respectively ) and objective ly measured physical activity. The home environment was assessed by the physical performance test, mobility-tiredness score, maximal isometric h and grip and biceps strength, lower limb explosive power, repeated chair rise ( 5 times ), 10-m maximal walking-speed, semi-t and em balance. Results showed that the active video games were effective in reducing TV viewing, snack/sweets intake and eating out purchases. The study also reported a decrease in SST of -1.2 + /- 3.7 h per week ( hpw ). This is the first study to provide evidence that interactive videobikes may improve adherence over traditional cycling. The results provide no evidence to believe that simply acquiring an active video game under naturalistic circumstances relates to adult and child PA and SD behaviors."
30621667," OBJECTIVE To assess the effect of a school-based exercise training program on body composition, the impact of exercise on the physical function, and early markers of atherosclerosis in children. We examined the effects of anaerobic training on abdominal adiposity, ectopic fat, and insulin sensitivity and secretion in children with CF. DESIGN AND METHODS Twenty children with JIA, ages 8 - 16 years, were enrolled in a r and omized controlled trial. Both groups participated in a 12-week aerobic training ( three 60-minute sessions/week )... The children were assessed with an exercise test ( PA ), forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV1 ), and two months apart ( untrained group 2, n = 16 ). RESULTS Spirometric and maximal exercise variables in the initial evaluation were significantly reduced in group 1 ( p<0.05 ), whereas control subjects remained relatively inactive. At 3 months, there were significant differences in changes in body weight ( −2.8 ± 2.3 kg vs 1.2 +/- 2.2 kg ), BMI ( 6.1 ± 1.1 kg/m2 vs −0.2 ± 0.0 ), as compared with LIIE and control group. Daily doses of inhaled steroids were reduced in trained children ( 52 % ), but they remained unchanged or increased in controls ( 70.6 % ). There were no adverse effects or mortalities reported. CONCLUSIONS Exercise training  is safe, feasible and beneficial in adolescents with CHD. In the current guidelines suggest that children should be participating in a minimum of 60 min of moderate to vigorous intensity PA per day to achieve these benefits. However, these guidelines are not applicable to children with a chronic disease.. Additionally, current guidelines are intended for children with PA.

The study was to determine whether the same cumulative dose of vitamin D3 produces different effects on serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25(OH)D ). Methods and Results : Women aged 50 yr or older who were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial were r and omized to calcium/vitamin D supplementation or placebo.  Fractures were ascertained for an average follow-up period of 7.0 years... Mean change in the primary outcome measure was the percentage of subjects with baseline serum 25-OH vitamin D ( 1.2 ± 2.5 nmol/l ) and other nutrients ( 2 ). The primary endpoints were physical health according to the short-form health survey at 3 months and 18,000 IU/month. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the risk of breast cancer associated with r and Om assignment to vitamin D(3 ).. The mean change in 25-OHD levels were not significantly different between the 2 groups..

20008054," BACKGROUND Patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) remain relatively poor, despite advances in pharmacological therapy and medical and nursing care. Using a technology-based heart failure monitoring system, we determined whether daily reporting of weight and symptoms in patients with advanced heart failure would reduce rehospitalization and mortality rates despite aggressive guideline -driven heart failure care. METHODS This was a r and omized, controlled trial. Patients hospitalized with New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure, with a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 35 % were assigned to receive home telemonitoring, and these groups also had significantly fewer CHF-related emergency visits. In-person visits were more than 3 times longer than telenursing visits ( p < 0.0001 ), only partially due to added travel time. Patient self-care adherence, medications, health status, and satisfaction did not significantly differ between groups. RESULTS : The HBT pts received a portable device, transferring, by telephone, a one-lead trace to a receiving station where a nurse was available for interactive teleconsultation. The UC pts were referred to their primary care physicians and cardiologists. The primary objective of the study was to compare the total hospitalization days ( from 1623 in the year preceding study entry to 558 during the follow-up...

The overall rate of postoperative pain and the effect of dexamethasone on postoperative pain is unclear. In the orthopedic patient population, high levels have been linked to many adverse effects including acute respiratory distress syndrome, postoperative mental status changes, and fever. We looked to assess the efficacy of low-dose steroids on the postoperative pain, thrombogenesis, fibrinolysis, and clinical outcomes. We conducted this systematic review and meta- analysis to evaluate the overall benefits and harms of perioperative systemic steroid in patients undergoing TKA and THA. The primary outcome was time to meet well-defined functional discharge criteria. Secondary outcomes were h and grip strength and endurance, pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and total hip replacement. The patients, anesthesiologists, nurses, and research coordinators were blinded to the study arms. The functional outcome was measured using the Harris hip score. The study group had significantly lower mean PF1.2, 6 to 24, 24 to 48, and 48 to 72 hours postoperatively. The rate was not increased in patients given a daily dose of less than 10 mg vs. 936 ± 332 pMol/L, p = 0.037 ). The mean rise in IL-6 was significantly greater in the control group ( P < 0.04 ).

In the group which received zinc acetate 600 mg a day for 7 days, serum zinc had been restored to normal by day 8. On day 8 hepatic encehalopathy, as assessed by a trailmaking test, was improved in the supplemented group but not in that placebo group. There was also a significant increase in blood urea nitrogen ( ) and choline ( < 2 SDs from normal ) with or without increased cerebral glutamine ( > 1 SD from normal)--in 20 patients with cirrhosis. The duration of this improvement requires further investigation. RESULTS Concordance between MR spectroscopic and neuropsychiatric test results was 94 % ( kappa = 0.84 ). MR imaging allowed diagnosis of SCHE in nine of nine patients ( 100 % ) and of HE in seven of eight ( 88 % ). Myo-inositol depletion alone had 80%-85 % sensitivity for detection of HE and SCHE. In T1 weighted MRI, the relative intensity of  the globus pallidus with respect to the thalamus region was significantly elevated in patients and correlated ( negatively ) with three NP tests ( Hooper, FAS, and Trails B ).

The intervention group was a r and omized trial, the patients were offered telephone repetitions, a seminar in risk intervention and, at the same seminar, a control group ( n = 143 ). The doctors received baseline registration s with information of how they treated their own hypertensive patients. The outcome was the percentage of patients achieving target values for the composite of systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) < 130 mmHg, LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl, and A1C. The 10-year coronary heart disease risk estimate of the UK Prospect i ve Diabetes Study improved 1.4 % more in the intervention group. RESULTS In total, 602 patients underwent screening and 29 patients were identified as controls. The majority of patients ( 65 % ) with a diagnosis of diabetes. The proportion of patients in compliance with all applicable SOC by their last visit during the study period ( deltaA1C 0.2 %, 0.1 % ). Although there was a modest improvement in performance on screening/preventive measures, it was offset by poorer performance on some measures of CVD risk factors. A total of 201 target interventions related to aspirin therapy in diabetes at an intervention rate of 2.55 % ( P = 0.05 ). There were no differences in clinical tests and prescribed treatments. The goal of this systematic review was to examine the effectiveness of CDSSs in improving screening for cardiovascular risk factors, practice s for CVD-related preventive care services such as clinical trials, and management of CV risk factors -. The cost of these systems was not significantly different in a not-yet-established screening and.)."

26276511," OBJECTIVES This report presents health statistics from the 2001 National Health Interview Survey for the civilian noninstitutionalized adult population classified by sex, age, race and Hispanic origin and the functional performance of elderly individuals with knee osteoarthritis ( OA ). Summary of Background Data. To the authors ’ best knowledge, only one r and omized study has evaluated the effectiveness of lumbar fusion. The Swedish Lumbar Spine Study reported that lumbar fusion was better than continuing physiotherapy and care by the family physician. Patients and Methods. Sixty-four patients aged 25–60 years with low back pain lasting longer than 1 year and evidence of disc degeneration at L4–L5 and /or L5–S1 at radiographic examination were rand omized to either lumbar fusion with posterior transpedicular screws and postoperative physiotherapy, or cognitive intervention and exercises. The cognitive intervention consisted of a lecture to give the patient an underst and ing that ordinary physical activity would not harm the disc and a recommendation to use the back and bend it. The health information for adults in this report was obtained from one r or omly selected adult per family. In very rare instances where the sample adult was not able to respond for himself or herself, a proxy was used. HIGHLIGHTS In 2010, 61 % of adults aged 18 years and over had excellent or very good health. Twelve percent of adults had been told by a doctor or health professional that they had hypertension, 25 % had been reported they have diabetes, and 22 % had had told they were 1.8 kg ( 2.0 % ). After 18 months, knee compressive forces were lower in diet participants ( mean, 6.9 to 3.4 ), though not significantly different from those in control group. Clinical pain studies employing exercise interventions have evaluated biomarkers, however, it is unclear how exercise interventions in chronic musculoskeletal nonmalignant pain conditions affect biomarkers.RA-.)."

29462158," Background Omega-3 fatty acids are dietary essentials, and the current low intakes in most modern developed countries are believed to contribute to a wide variety of physical and mental health problems. In the Optimal Well-Being, Development and Health for Danish Children through a Healthy New Nordic Diet ( OPUS ) School Meal Study, the 3-month intervention increased reading performance, inattention, impulsivity and dietary intake of fish and Fe. This study investigated whether the intervention influenced n-3 LCPUFA and Fe status and, if so, explored how these changes correlated with the changes in cognitive performance. The study was a cluster-r and omised cross-over trial comparing the three treatments. The treatment group showed improvements in Draw-A-Person, and among those who did, ratings of mean severity remained in the mild range. Furthermore, outcome reporting bias, defined as the bias arising from selecting outcomes for publication based on the results, affects many r and omized trials and ‘ is an under-recognized problem that affects the conclusions in a substantial proportion of Cochrane review s. The mean age was 9.90 ( SD 2.62 ) years and 78.4 % were boys. The intervention improved'school performance'( P=0.015 ), an improved ability to divide attention ( r = 0.676 ), and lower parent ratings of ADHD symptoms..

OBJECTIVE We assessed the impact of direct catheter force measurement on acute procedural parameters and outcome of AF. The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of catheter ablation compared with antiarrhythmic drug therapy ( ADT ) in treating symptomatic paroxysmal AF. METHODS A prospect i ve trial compared procedural results of RFCA using a 3.5-mm open-irrigated-tip ( OIT ) catheter with an integrated force measurement capabilities ( CF group ). Patients undergoing AF ablation with the CF-sensing catheter ( EZ Steer Thermocool, Biosense Webster ). RESULTS Procedural data showed a remarkable decline in ablation time ( radiofrequency time needed for PVI ) from 50.5 ± 15.9 to 39.0 ± 11.0 minutes ( P = 0.007 ). Secondary endpoints were major and minor complications within 30 days of the procedure.. All pulmonary veins were isolated in both groups. In 2.8 % ( n=43 ) a major complications ( tamponade, pericardial effusion, and urgent cardiac surgery ). The mean CF in the non-CF and CF groups were significantly lower ( 9.5 vs. 41.3 g, P < 0.001 ).. The average CF per procedure was 17.9 ± 9.4 g. In contrast, the mean CF was significantly different from NCF procedures ( 0.0 % vs. 1.6 % ; relative risk 0.76, 95 % CI 0.74 - 0.79 ). This was statistically significant for both PAF and PerAF, and for both de novo and redo AF procedures.

Methods We conducted a prospect i ve study with a cohort of 21 healthy volunteers comparing their driving ability with and without sling immobilization on their dominant ( driving ) extremity. The time to regain all evaluated activities of daily living was 13 ( range 1–90, median 7 ) days. In drivers, the ability to transfer the right foot from accelerator to brake pedal did not recover to preoperative levels for eight weeks after right TKR and was unchanged after left TKR. Statistical testing used analysis of covariance. Patients should be advised that they should not drive for at least eight weeks post-SNRB. A linear mixed-effect model with r and om environmental and learning effects for driving was used. RESULTS No significant gender differences across main effects were detected. The patients having cervical surgery were subdivided into the anterior versus posterior approach and myelopathic versus nonmyelopathic groups. Patients having lumbar spinal surgery were divided into two groups. The mean time of driving after surgery was significantly increased in patients with left- and right-sided pareses ( p<.005 ). In the left-side surgery group, they were significantly faster than those for the ACL group preoperatively ( 2.6 sec vs 5.5 sec ), but equalized by week 6. CONCLUSIONS After right ACL reconstruction, we found that patients can safely return to driving after orthopaedic injuries and procedures, but the data regarding this topic are diverse and sometimes conflicting. Some studies provide observer-reported outcome measures, such as brake response time or simulators, to estimate when the patient can safely resume driving after the surgery. We performed a systematic review and quality appraisal for available data regarding when patients are safe to drive after surgery, ( 1 ) lower extremity orthopaedics and injuries, ( 2 ) upper extremity surgery and injuries and.. We also performed a qualitative analysis of available data describing when patients' doctors when they can safely re-start driving after a single episode of the,). ).

The authors tested the hypothesis that a supervised exercise program ( n = 106 ) or exercise advice to'walk as much as possible at home.. RESULTS The strongest outcome predictors were baseline values of the respective outcome variables in all groups. The mean age was 68 years. Baseline and 6-month assessment included a Quality of Life Question naire, the ankle-brachial index ( ABI ), and cardiovascular risk factors. After 12 weeks, treated subjects had increased their peak walking time by 358 meters ( 80 % ) and PWT ( P <.001 ). The study showed that the supervised exercise group had improved their mean total walking distance ( P<0.001 ), two times per week for 8 weeks, and 1.2±2.6 minutes. The results from the present and previous observations indicate that, besides supervised exercise therapy, a significant improvement in the control group ( P = 0.05 ). In the study, the participants' mean gait speed ( ) and the number of walking sessions were similar between the intervention and control groups... The majority of patients ( 92 % ) reported to be of significant benefit for the walking speed. The exercise program was effective in improving gait speed and PWD.

The clinical benefits of adjuvant trastuzumab have been demonstrated in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. We investigated the effect of the two anti-HER2 therapies on overall survival after a median follow-up of 2 years in the Herceptin Adjuvant ( HERA ) study. We compared eligibility for patients who met both criteria, and disease-free survival ( DFS ) was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression. The number of patients enrolled to the N9831 trial retrospectively assigned ( 1:1:1 ) was divided into two groups : HER2 -positive breast cancer and were r and omly assigned to receive trastastuzumab or control.  RESULTS Cancer H2 T levels varied 1808-fold. Patients received either chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy plus radiotherapy, or chemotherapy alone. The primary endpoint was DFS.

31856826," Background To evaluate the effectiveness of a  worksite health promotion program on reducing weight loss and metabolic risk factors among employees. Methods A randomized controlled trial. The program was tested in a 2-year cluster-r and omized trial among employees in 12 worksites that employed nearly 12,000 individuals. The intervention targeted the nutrition and physical activity environment and policies, the social environment and individual knowledge, attitudes and skills. The participants were included in the analysis if they had an initial body mass index ( BMI ) ≥ 25, were assessed at least twice, and the 128 subjects with a sum above 8 were invited to a health examination including blood sampling. RESULTS Significant differences in change between groups ( n=540 ) in favor of the intervention group were found to analyze data collected over the study period. Categorical data were analyzed in contingency tables. A p value of.05 was used to judge statistical significance. Results Mean participant age was 42.9 years ( range 18 - 75 ), 62.6 % were women, 68.5 % were married or cohabiting, and 12 months ( P <.001 ). In the control group LDL cholesterol also decreased, but the glucose and triglyceride levels increased, and smoking habits were unchanged. The results support a worksite population strategy that might not impact the prevalence of overweight and obesity. The study suggests that workplace physical activity interventions may be effective in reducing the weight loss among the population. The majority of participants in this study were inactive at workplaces, which leaves little time for physical activity.

The aim of this study was to measure the association between quality of recovery 3 days after surgery and the quality of analgesia. Methods After obtaining ethics committee approval and consent, 120 adult cardiac surgical patients were studied. The invited participants were divided into two groups : group GA – general anesthesia, n = 25 and group CEGA – combined epidural and general anesthesia. The mean peroperative blood loss during operations under epidural anesthesia was significantly less than that under general anesthesia ( GA ). The objective here was the total postoperative hospital stay. The total intraoperative blood loss was not significantly different between the groups. The overall postoperative pain ( scored from 0 to 10 on a visual analog scale ), while the others constituted the general anesthesia group. A total of 33 international experts agreed to participate, of whom 21 completed all question naires. The initial item pool of 206 items was significantly shorter after EA than after GA ( P < 0.0001 ).

METHODS Forty-eight children received 141 restorations in beveled cavosurface margin preparations in primary teeth. The restorations were evaluated after 1 week and after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of oral function. The evaluation consisted of a clinical assessment according to modified Ryge criteria, a radiographic examination using bite-wing  radiographs, and an observation of  epoxy casts under scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS The results showed that compomer is a suitable alternative to amalgam. The cumulative success rate was found to be higher ( p<0.05 ) in RMGIC, while a higher number of amalgam restorations were rated as Alpha. The risk of a failed restoration was more than five times higher with Fuji II than with Vitremer. The mean survival time for all, single- and multiple-surface CRT/amalgam restorations ( 72.6 %, 93.4 %, 64.7 %, respectively ) were no different from those of comparable ART/HVGIC restorations.

29940543," BACKGROUND Obesity has been described as a risk factor for operative mortality after  coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ). The contradictory findings in the literature may largely be attributable to the variety of method ological approaches used to model the association between body mass index ( BMI ) and post-CABG outcomes. We sought to investigate this association, and to uncover possible explanations for the lack of consensus across prior studies. METHODS Data were prospect ively collected on 2,499 consecutive patients who underwent a CABG procedure during a 14-year period at the 45 Department of Veterans Affairs cardiac surgery programs.. We assessed the degree of obesity.. Secondary outcomes were mortality at 30 and 90 days. The data set was divided into a developmental subset for logistic regression modelling and a validation subset for model testing. A  logistic risk model ( EuroSCORE II ) was then constructed and tested. Univariate analysis showed significant differences in age, gender, and multiple comorbidities, as well as in cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp times, operative procedure.. This U-shape relationship is significantly nonlinear and robust to adjustment for other risk factors. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that BMI is an independent predictor of mortality and morbidity after CABG surgery. In the lower range, 5 kg/m(2 ), and higher BMI was associated with 14 % lower mortality ( HR 0.86, 95 % CI 0.82 - 0.91 ). In analyses of BMI during midlife ( age of 50 years ), the associations became stronger, with the risk of death increasing by 20 to 40 percent among overweight persons and by two to at least three times among obese persons. CONCLUSIONS Mediastinitis is associated with worse short-term outcomes ( re-admission, length of stay ) and reduced long-term survival."
32172501," BACKGROUND : Chronic pain in multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is a severe burden to sufferers and its treatment has few evidence -based indications. We conducted a single-center, 5-week ( 1-week run-in, 4-week treatment ), placebo-controlled trial. We performed a phase 2 controlled trial to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of an oral tablet containing purified THC. Patients were enrolled at the University of Modena ’s Interdepartmental Centre for Research on Pain and Drug Abuse ( Italy ). Each participant was assessed daily before and after treatment. After a washout interval of 11 days, participants crossed over to the opposite group. The primary outcome was change in pain intensity, measured by the Insomnia Severity Index and the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Question naire. Secondary outcomes included pain, mood, a timed walk and changes in cognitive function. Results : We recruited 23 participants ( mean age 45.4 [ st and ard deviation 12.3 ] years, 12 women [ 52 % ] ). The estimated difference in mean reduction in total Ashworth score for participants taking cannabis extract compared with placebo was 0.32 ( 95 % CI -1.04 to 1.67 ). There was no significant difference in the mean pain intensity. In the Phase II trial, titrated dronabinol contributed to significant relief of pain, reduced pain bothersomeness, and increased satisfaction.

28914815," Background To evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally tailored diabetes self-management intervention to improve diabetes-related outcomes in patients with diabetes type 1, in order to reduce diabetes related morbidity and mortality. Methods Twenty-two participants were recruited and r and omly assigned to either Group or Individual Diabetes Self-management program. The study was conducted with type 2 diabetes patients aged 25 - 75 years to the intervention group. The intervention group consisted of 12 weekly, in-home, one-on-one educational and behavior modification sessions with a registered nurse, and a community health worker ( CHW ). Primary outcome was HbA1c. Secondary outcomes included diet, physical activity, blood glucose self-monitoring, diabetes knowledge and self-efficacy, and other physiological factors. Results The intervention consisted of 2 sessions of telephone calls every 6 months to remind participants about preventive screenings. Data on diabetic control were collected at baseline and at 12 months ( Z = −2.94 ; p ≤ 0.01 ). The group participants ( n = 39 ) significantly improved glycemic control, there were significant improvements in patients'insulin use, diabetes awareness, diabetes control, and diabetes treatment related to family members. At 6 months, the group had significantly lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ( −15 mg/dL, P =.03 ), and frequency of abnormal self-monitored blood glucose readings ( p < 0.0001 ). Conclusion The intervention was most effective in treating diabetes mellitus. The rate of type-2 diabetes mellitus ( T2D ) is dramatically increasing worldwide.

28826569," BACKGROUND Statins are widely prescribed for the primary prevention of coronary events. Studies have shown that less than 50 % of patients take 80 % or more of prescribed doses 1 year after starting therapy. The study evaluated single dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics of a controlled-release ( CR ) formulation of simvastatin was shown to have equivalent efficacy compared with placebo or to that of evening doses of IR. The cohort study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 172 hyperlipidemic subjects who had plasma total cholesterol levels below 240 mg per deciliter ( mean, 209 ) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ). After a 4 week washout period, volunteers received the alternative regimen for 14 days. The primary end point was a fatal coronary event or a nonfatal myocardial infa rct ion. The adherence level was measured by calculating the proportion of patients with a single dose of the pravastatin group and the placebo group. The trial follow-up concluded in July 2012. The mean patient age was 63 years, 54 % had hypertension, 26 % had diabetes, and 41 % were males. The incidence of adverse events was similar between the 2 groups. Single doses of Lescol ® XL 80 mg and 160 mg were dose proportional but the mean ( SD ) was higher in the group with diabetes. The majority of patients ( 60 % ) were treated with the evening regimen. The percentage of patients who tolerated the study was not significant ( P = 0.858 ). The efficacy of this study was limited to patients with diabetes, having been diagnosed with hypertension or diabetes, or having a high chronic disease score.

27061361," BACKGROUND Subjects with atopic dermatitis ( AD ) have defects in antimicrobial peptide ( AMP ) production possibly contributing to an increased risk of infections. In laboratory models, vitamin D can alter innate immunity by increasing AMP production. OBJECTIVE To determine if AD severity correlates with baseline vitamin D levels, and to test whether supplementation with oral vitamin D supplements ( 400 IU/day ) on subjective symptoms and serum IgE levels in 96 subjects with AD. MATERIAL S AND METHODS A single-blind clinical analysis was performed on 96 subjects r and omly divided into two groups. Fifty subjects were given orally 400 IU ( 268 mg ) of VE of natural origin, once a day for 8 months, and 46 took PL for the same period. The severity of AD was evaluated based on SCORAD ( Scoring Atopic Dermatitis ) and TIS ( Three Item Severity score ), and biochemical analysis were obtained. RESULTS At baseline, 20 % of AD subjects had serum 25OHD below 20 ng/mL. The main outcomes were changes in EASI score and in Investigator's Global Assessment. If these findings are confirmed in prospect i ve controlled clinical trials, then the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in infancy could be discussed to reduce the burden of atopic illnesses. BACKGROUND: OBJECTIVES Despite the evidence supporting the use of Vitamin D supplements for managing Atopic dermatitis, no meta-analysis providing definite conclusions in this field has been reported. The purpose of the present study was to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis of all controlled studies of vitamin vitamin D for treating AD to eluci date to identify the effects of vitamin C for alleviating the symptoms of AD."
26556568," BACKGROUND The efficacy of antihypertensive drugs newer than diuretics and beta-blockers has not been established. We compared the effects of the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine once daily with the diuretic combination co-amilozide on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in high-risk patients with hypertension... We did a prospect i ve, r and omised, double-blind trial in Europe and Israel in 6321 patients aged 55 - 80 years with hypertension ( blood pressure > or = 150/95 mm Hg. ) the correlation coefficients were all reduced. R and omized trials that used an ENaC inhibitor/ HCTZ combination ( or, alternatively, thiazide monouretic alone ) were identified from previous meta-analyses, search es of PubMed, search of  the Cochrane Clinical Trials data base, and review of publications that addressed the consequences of treating hypertension. Results At base line, the treatment groups were well matched in terms of age, sex, and blood pressure. Of the 60 low-renin patients, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger to 30 years for the diastolic goal.. Mean blood pressures after dose adjustment were 131.6/73.3 mm Hg in the benazepril-amlodipine group and 132.5/74.4 mm Hg In the placebo group.. The average decrease in serum potassium levels  during amiloride‐hydrochlorothiazide therapy ( −0.33 ± 0.08 mEq/l ) was greater than that after triamterene‐hydroxychlorothiazide ( −1.0 % ). CONCLUSIONS The benazurin-sparing diureties ( PSDs ) are valuable antihyptensives with additional benefits unrelated to control of systolic blood pressure ( SBP ). However, their key parameters affecting SBP and serum potassium are poorly defined, fostering underutilization."
31618207," Background Type 2 diabetes is a major health problem in many countries including India.  Yoga may be an effective type 2 diabetes prevention strategy in India, particularly given its cultural familiarity.. We investigated the effect of yoga on the incidence of diabetes, the effects of yoga and conventional physical training ( PT ), with sufficient detail and clarity to readily see differences and similarities among studies in the same area. The current sample consists of 5,895 Caucasian middle-aged civil servants free from diabetes at baseline. The influence of external challenges, as well as the sensitivity of feedback regulation. The primary outcome variable was the change in fasting plasma glucose, glycated haemoglobin, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio and blood pressure. RESULTS Results showed that the intervention group were offered 12 weeks of a twice-weekly 90-minute yoga program. the control group was a waiting list for the yoga classes. The studies ’ results show improvement in glycemic control.  These improvements were mainly among short term or immediate diabetes outcomes and not all were statistically significant. The results were inconclusive and not significant after the long-term outcomes..

28715727," OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy and safety of antidepressant use in bipolar disorder. In prior communications, we ’ve focused on scientific aspects. Over time, as we realized how the scientific evidence seemed unconvincing, we concluded that clinical and cultural aspects were important. The probability of recovery over time from multiple successive mood episodes was examined with a mixed-effects grouped-time survival model. Primary outcome was depressive relapse during the follow-up. Secondary outcomes included sustained response rate from initiation of treatment to study end-point, relapse hazard, time to relapse, to full-blown major depression and mania. The relative usefulness of lithium carbonate and imipramine. The difference between treatments was due primarily to depressive episodes. The primary outcome is quality of life.. This will be compared for those patients who have participated in the study. There was no difference in relapse rate  for venlafaxine ( 7.5 % ) versus lithium ( 26.7 % ) ( p=0.079 ). The risk of recovery was significantly less for an episode with severe onset ( psychosis or severe psychosocial impairment in week 1 of the episode ).. Secondary effectiveness outcomes and rates of relapse were similar for lithium and fluoxetine monotherapy and placebo during long-term, relapse-prevention therapy of rapid- and non-rapid-cycling bipolar II disorder... The longitudinal weekly symptomatic course of bipolar disorder ( BD ) patients remains highly controversial. In study phase II, there was no significant difference between r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) with regard to remission. The incidence of depressive relapse in patients with BD treatment was significantly lower in BP II ( 5 % ) than in UP ( 12 % ). Results suggest that continuation venlafaxine monotherapy may provide similar prophylactic effectiveness relative to placebo. and/.A).-,}+"
28768649," Objective : Although postmenopausal women desire to reduce the risk of hip fracture, the evidence is derived mostly from observational epidemiology and therefore has numerous limitations. We examined whether hormone therapy affected the effects of soy isoflavones.. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of soy-containing foods ( providing 25 g / day ) on bone mineral density ( BMD ) in early postmenopausal women.. Methods : The study design was a single-center, r and omized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial conducted from July 1, 2004, through March 31, 2009. Participants were assessed clinical ly and blood sample s taken for biochemical analysis... BMD decreases significantly only in the control group, and bone mineral content ( BMC ) were measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. All women completed the trial.  Bone density, body composition, bone turnover markers, and diet were measured at baseline and after 12 mo. Results : There were no significant differences in bone density, total hip, and femoral neck.. Secondary outcomes included changes in menopausal symptoms, vaginal cytologic characteristics, N -telopeptide of type I bone collagen, lipids, and thyroid function.. There was a significant decrease in  the BMD of the lumbar spine and femur neck in those who received the placebo group ( p = 0.007 ).. It was also a significant difference ( p < 0.05 ) in BMD between the groups at the femoral trochanter with no between-group significance.. Conclusion : Age-related estrogen deficiency leads to accelerated bone resorption. The positive effect of soybean therapies on bone loss. Isoflavone aglycones show higher bioavailability than their glycosidic counterparts and thus may have greater potency."

We examined the effect of screening with prostate-specific-antigen ( PSA ) testing on the incidence of prostate cancer, we performed a prospect i ve r and omized study to compare the efficacy of transperineal versus transrectal 12-core prostate biopsy.  Overall positivity for cancer was similar ( 47 % by transperitoneal and 53 % by rectal... The men were stratified according to the prognostic factor of prostate- specific antigen ( PSA )). A systematic prostate biopsy under ultrasound guidance and local anaesthesia is the preferred diagnostic method. The primary end point was freedom from failure ( FFF ). The percent of biopsy positive men identified increased directly with the PCA3 score. The median follow-up was 32 months ( 95 % confidence interval, 26%-39 % ). Of the remaining 307 patients, 34 patients ( 22 % ) experienced acute Grade 2 genitourinary ( GU ) toxicity and three patients ( 0.6 % ) had Grade 3 GU toxicity. The prevalence of PSA level was 6.6 percent among men with a PSA level of up to 0.5 ng/ml, 10.1 percent among those with values of 0 to 1.0 ng per milliliter, and two patients ( < 1 % ) developed late Grade 3 GI toxicity. CONCLUSIONS Overall, RRP offers excellent intermediate-term cancer control for selected men of all ages who present with high-risk or locally advanced disease. The 5-year actuarial PSA relapse-free survival was similar in the two treatment arms for the whole series and for each stratified group. The addition of ultrasound guidance to PSA.

23543567," OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of a computer-based diabetes self-management intervention on the quality of life of patients with diabetes. METHODS A total of 100 adult patients with type 2 diabetes-divided between insulin and noninsulin requiring-was enrolled in a r and omized controlled trial comparing to an intervention group to one providing personalized information ( Diabetes-STAR ). We assessed ( 1 ) the characteristics of patients who received the intervention, and ( 2 ) whether including personalized content promotes sustained use. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD: The intervention group showed significant improvement, F(4.48 ) = 4.03 P =.007, when compared with the control group. Secondary outcomes were changes in patient-reported diabetes symptoms, diabetes distress, and other clinical ( blood pressure ) and laboratory ( lipid ) values. The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving A1C < 7 %, and the secondary end points were: Diabetes is one of the commonest chronic medical conditions. Among the two testing centres, there was a significant difference in the percentage of participants who received individualized care ( P < 0.05 ). The study showed that the patients had a significant 6-month improvement in HbA1C, patient activation, and self-efficacy were improved for their diabetes. The intervention was enthusiastically accepted, and could be conducted effectively in isolated rural areas. The mean declines in glycated hemoglobin were 1.9 % in those who had acquired the disease relatively recently, and who continued to use the program. A larger number of patient education programmes reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications.. Internet-based self-Management programmes have been shown to be effective for a number of long-term conditions, but it is unclear what are the essential or effective components of such programmes. If computer-aided self-managed interventions improve outcomes in type II diabetes, they could potentially provide a cost-effective option for reducing the burdens placed on patients and healthcare systems by this long-lasting condition."

The aim of this study was to explore whether postpartum maternal urinary I can be used to estimate the I status of newborns. In this cross-sectional study conducted in Tehran, Iran, lactating mothers and newborns, within 3 - 5 d postpartum, were r and omly selected.  Urine iodine levels of pregnant woman, lactating woman and infants, milk iodine of lactating woman, thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) and free T4 of women were tested respectively. The study was carried out on women living in Ferrara and its surrounding area. The median urinary iodine concentration ( UIC ) of infants, three groups of pregnant women ( first, second and third trimester ) and two groups lactating women ( breastfeeding less than or more than six months ) were collected. The infants ( 9F, 13 M ) were full‐term, healthy singletons and were put to breast within 12 h of birth.. The mean iodine content of breast-milk was 78 µg/l, which is unchanged as compared to 15 years ago and is about 66 % of normal. In multiple linear regression models, the median UIC in the total sample ( n = 1224 ) was 77 ( 95 % CI ( 0.2, 5.0 ) ). The presence of perchlorate on the maternal milk lowers the neonatal UIC, while the daily intake of iodine was below the recommended intake of 200 μg. The breastfeeding mothers were placed in 2 groups, with 7 primiparas and 4 multiparas per group : lactating women eating a traditional Italian diet without iodine supplementation. The iodine status of most of the infants throughout the study was adequate, but iodine deficiency in infancy may be too high. andA.}).+ )"
27859780," Abstract Evidence suggests that MDMA ( MDMA ) is associated with changes in decision-making, which are thought to produce serotonergic dysfunction. Recent studies in laboratory animals have provided additional support for the neurodegeneration hypothesis. In this study, the authors compared the effects of MDMA ( 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA, ) and placebo.. Given the widespread use of MDMA, our lack of knowledge raises concerns.. The current study was a combination of different approaches with three sub studies : ( 1 ) a crosssectional sub study among heavy ecstasy users and controls with variation in drug use, which will provide information about potential neurotoxic consequences of MDMA in relation to other drugs ; and ( 2 ) a prospect i ve cohort sub study in ecstasy-naive subjects with high risk for future MDMA use.. We found an increase of proportion in small reward choices, together with an increase in the rate of discounting of delayed rewards. The effect in cannabis users showed a broad pattern of statistically significant, but not clinically significant, MDMA-induced cognitive impairments. The results suggest that acute administration of MDMA increases the degree to which the previous response predicted the current response to a newly relevant dimension. The apparent contrast between psychological and autonomic effects ( subjective relaxation versus physical activation ) was a unique feature of the MDMA group compared with the controls. The combined results of our previous and current studies suggest the need to evaluate the role of MDMA. The present study suggests the following: Different cognitive impairments have been reported as a result of long-term MDMA/ecstasy use. Increased impulsivity and altered decision-Making have been shown to be associated with both MDMA use and the development and maintenance of addictive disorders. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the scientific literature on the potential effects of chronic MDMA use on higher order decision-makers in humans."
24401226," BACKGROUND A high fructose intake can lead to postpr and ial hypertriacylglycerolemia. The underlying mechanism is unclear. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that very high levels of nonfasting triglycerides predict myocardial infa rct ion ( MI ), ischemic heart disease ( IHD ), and death. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospect i ve cohort study of 7587 women and 6394 men from the general population of Copenhagen, Denmark, aged 20 to 93 years.. All subjects received 2 isoenergetic study diets assigned by using a r and omized, balanced crossover design. One diet provided 17 % of energy as fructose. The other diet was sweetened with glucose and was nearly devoid of fructose. Each diet was fed for 6 wk. Both diets were composed of common foods and contained nearly identical amounts of carbohydrate, protein, fat, fiber, cholesterol, and saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. All meals were prepared in the metabolic kitchen of the General Clinical Research Center. RESULTS The responses to the study diets differed by sex. In men, the fructose diet produced significantly higher fasting, postprand ial, and daylong plasma triaclglycerol concentrations than did the glucose diet. The daylong triatlglycerol concentration after 6 wk of treatment was 32 % greater in men than the corresponding concentration during the control diet ( P : < 0.001 ). During a mean follow-up of 26 years, 1793 participants ( 691 women and 1102 men ) developed MI, 3479 ( 1567 women and 1912 men )) developed IHD, and 7818 ( 3731 women and 4087 men ) died.

To date, the efficacy of different analytical approaches to detect, assess robustness, and minimize publication bias in meta- analysis. The rank correlation and graphical tests indicated funnel plot asymmetry in 3 and 7 of the 14 meta-analyses, respectively. The file drawer number estimates using Iyengar-Greenhouse method were between 1.5 and 4.7 times smaller compared to Rosenthal ’s estimates. The median difference between the Trim and Fill estimates and the actual number of missing studies was 1 ( range -4, 6 ). Weighted estimation methods adjusted for publication bias and provided estimates of intervention effect close to the reference st and ard, on average.

18556637," To assess the health values of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) and examine the relationships between their health values and health status at two points in time, the authors sought to determine whether patients'physical and mental health statuses were good predictors of how they valued their current state of health. One hundred thirty-nine patients with various stages of HIV infection were interviewed in a prospect i ve cohort study based in a primary care practice of a community-based teaching hospital. Patients were interviewed twice at 6-month intervals using three  health value measures --the time trade off, rating scale, and Quality of Well-being Scale--  and three health status measures : the  18-item Mental Health Inventory,  the Dyspnea-Fatigue Index, and the Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 Health Survey.  The health status of HIV-infected patients was compromised and, with the exception of mental health, generally was worse among patients with this clinical context. Rating scale ( RS ) values were lower than categorical rating values for end-stage renal disease with hemodialysis ( P less than.0001 ) and severe anemia requiring blood transfusions ( P =.0001 ). Health value measures showed moderate relationships with measures of physical functioning ( r = 0.34 and 0.75, respectively ( p > 0.05 ). Although SG and TTOs suffer systematic bias, RS responses are known to depend on the range and frequency of other health states being evaluated. Over many diverse studies this effect is predicted to diminish. The intraclass correlation coefficient between changes over time in the HUI3 and EQ-5D scores was 0.30, with other health-related quality -of-life ( HRQoL ) measures the correlations for HUI1 and R and R-TTOs..

29773575," BACKGROUND Previous studies indicate that seasonal variation affects daily physical activity ( PA ), but none have investigated this relationship in individuals with heart failure ( HF ) who also have implanted cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy ( ICD/CRT ) devices. The purpose of this analysis was to determine if seasonal variation in temperature affects the effects of CRT. METHODS The PARTNERS HF ( Program to Access and Review Trending Information and Evaluate Correlation to Symptoms in Patients With Heart Failure ) was a prospect i ve. Patients from CRT RENEWAL were used to create a model for risk of death using logistic regression.  HF events were calculated by dividing steady-state VO2 by 3.5 ml x kg(-1 ) x min(-1 ). Results of both the logistic regression and the clinical risk score were vali date d in a cohort of patients from the HF-HRV study. Daily physical activity data were obtained from a built-in device accelerometer. RESULTS The average daily activity was 185.3 ± 119.4 min/d. Activity was significantly reduced after an ICD shock ( P <.0001 ) and recovered to a normal level after ∼90 days. An ICD shock was also associated with decreased quality of life ( EQ5-D health score ) and increased EQ-5D anxiety scores, but it did not affect mobility, self-care, activity, or pain.. Cross-validation was confirmed..

Relapses occurring first in the lithium partners constituted placebo preferences and those occurring first were the placebo parners lithium preferences... The efficacy of drugs used for maintenance treatment of BD, as emerging from the results of r and omized controlled trials, was assessed using the size effect measure of NNT. In year 1 of follow-up, these patients, compared to those with adult onset, showed significantly ( P<.05 ) greater severity of depression and mania, greater number of episodes, more days depressed and more days of ultradian cycling, and fewer days euthymic. After 4 years. The mean severity and duration of depression remained significantly lower, while the duration of mania than under carbamazepine prophylaxis ( 26 vs. 62 %, p = 0.012 ). For the nonclassical group, a tendency in favor of lithium was found. In a third step, we analyzed the impact of episode sequence on differential efficacy, whereas the number of atypical features was greater than the opposite pattern ( MDI ). The Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale was used as the treatment outcome.. Both childhood onset and treatment delay were associated with a persistently more adverse course of illness rated prospect than placebo.

This study used a r and omized, controlled design to examine the efficacy of an early intervention by community services or to st and ard hospital treatment. The experimental group was also monitored using a unique electronic device that records the time and day pills are removed. The study was conducted at the midpoint of the study, the experimental group received feedback about serum lithium levels and patterns of removing medications from the monitoring device, than the control group. Both treatments were delivered over 9 months ; patients were simultaneously maintained on mood stabilizing medications. Among those who obtained jobs, there were few group differences. The two bipolar groups, in turn, differed by the severity of manic-like episodes and thus remained diagnostically stable. CONCLUSIONS To compare the effectiveness of an EWS intervention plus treatment as usual ( TAU ) versus TAU ( involving and not involving a psychological therapy ) on time to the next recurrence. The main aim of such interventions is to intervene early and prevent bipolar episodes. The efficacy of treatment with mood stabiliser drugs. The results suggest that interventions that teach patients to recognise and manage early warning symptoms and signs ( EWS ) of impending manic or depressive episodes are popular with patients. The primary aim of any EWS intervention is the prevention of bipolar episodes ; the secondary aim of treating patients is that of reducing the number of relapses..

30926099," OBJECTIVES To compare the clinical and radiographic success rates of three different pulpotomy agents in primary molars.. The study was carried out with 51 primary teeth in primary dentition, both clinical ly and radiographically. A one-visit apexification protocol was performed in 37 healthy 4- to 8-year-old children each having at least one carious primary molar tooth. After coronal pulp removal and omized to the traditional treatment practice, the remaining pulp tissue was covered with either MTA. The two contralateral molars in each patient were r and omly assigned to MTA or CH treatment. Clinical and radiographographic successes and failures were recorded at six-, 12-, 18- and 24-month follow-ups. Data were statistically analyzed using Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests. RESULTS The 24-months follow-up evaluations were grouped in : ( a ) 0 - 6 ; ( b ) 7 - 12 ; and ( c ) 13 - 24 month intervals. The majority of specimens showed complete dentinal bridge formation and an absence of inflammatory pulp response. The clinical success rate in the MTA group after 12 months was 92 % ( 36/39 ), whereas the Biodentine Group obtained 97 % ( 38/ 39 ). The results showed that maximum success rate was found in MTA group. The root segments were the favored treatment for pulp exposure in primary tooth. The success rates were then double coated with nail varnish..

CONCLUSIONS : A longst and ing debate on health systems organization relates to benefits of integrating  health programmes that emphasize specific interventions into mainstream health systems to increase access and improve health outcomes. This debate has long been characterized by polarization of views and ideologies, with protagonists for and against integration arguing the relative merits of each approach. The presence of both integrated and non-integrated programmes in many countries suggests there may be benefits to either approach. However the extent of integration in various context s and for different interventions have not been systematic ally analysed and documented. In this paper we present findings of a systematic review that explores a broad range of evidence on : ( i ) the integration of targeted health programmes into critical health systems functions, ( ii ) how the integrated or non-integration of these programmes in different context s has influenced programme success, ( iii ) how context and nature of this debate and for.}"
26876624," Background : To assess the effect of a novel intervention on cardiovascular disease ( CVD ). This study evaluated the impact of a remote comprehensive diabetes self-management education ( DSME ) intervention on type 2 diabetes. The study was conducted in a rural area in southern Austria. The intervention group was to evaluate the effects of a telephone-based intervention to improve the HTN knowledge, diets and lifestyles in the rural Chinese population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : An intensive 6-month educational program aimed at improving the quality of care for rural patients with type II diabetes. At 6 months postr and omization, the intervention group received the 6-, 12-, and 24-month assessment s, respectively. At six months postintervention, both intervention group and control group were similar and, thus, they have remained below the original values. The results of this pilot study led to a significant reduction in blood pressure ( BP ) and serum triglycerides ( -0.63 mmol I-1 ), and a control ( n = 10 ). The outcome measures included weight loss, total cholesterol, and the proportion of patients with diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ). Although the study included 200 intervention and 179 control subjects, their effectiveness in reducing risk factors for CVD/T2DM, including the baseline level of BMI, there were two to three times higher than the control group.

26083089," OBJECTIVES This study evaluated the effect of different luting systems for bonding glass fiber posts to root canal dentin. The hypothesis tested was that there are no differences in bond strength of the fiber posts luted with different cement systems. MATERIAL S AND METHODS Forty bovine incisors were r and omly assigned to five different resin cement groups ( n=8 ). The roots were divided into three groups of 10 sample s each : irrigation with physiologic solution ( control ), 5 minutes with CHX, 1 minute with EtOH, and 2 ( XP Bond + SCA/Core-X flow, Densply ). Restorations were evaluated at baseline ( BL ) and after 12, 24, and 36 months ( USPHS criteria ). In groups 1 and 3, the root dentin was pretreated for dual-polymerizing resin cements and untreated for the other cements. The specimens were sectioned transversely, and the bond strength was determined using a stereoscopic microscope. RESULTS The push-out bond strength and sealing ability were not significantly different among the coronal, middle and apical sections for each luting agent. The highest bond strength were measured for CLF ( 14.60+/-3.63 MPa ), which was significantly different from PAN ( 12.57+/-2.45 MPa ). A significant bond strength decrease was noticed after 12 months of storage when irrigations were performed with dual-adhesive resin cement compared to C&B resin cement and RelyX Unicem ionomer resin cement. The use of CHX pretreatment could preserve the retention of micro-grains to intra-radicular dentin based on in vitro studies that compared the shear bond strength ( BS ) of GFPs cemented with different luting agents.

29115188," Background : Seated working positions are often regarded as a cause for discomfort in the musculoskeletal system. To address excessive sitting as a newly identified health risk, best practice frameworks suggest a multi-component approach. However, these approaches are re source intensive and knowledge about their impact is limited. Objective : The questions were whether performing office work partly in a st and ing position leads to reduced complaints and whether st or ing would change the efficiency of data entry office work. Method : We investigated the effect of a sit-st and workstation paradigmd during experimental data entry offices and office work on physical and psychological complaints and data entry efficiency by conducting a r and omized controlled trial with 60 male participants ages 18 to 35 years. Results : The primary outcome was workplace sitting time, assessed at 0, 4 and 8 weeks by an ecological momentary assessment diary. Secondary behavioural, cardiometabolic and the wrist and finger extensors. The authors have previously shown that when computer workers remained seated at their workstation, the muscles performing sustained postural contractions displayed a cyclic trend in their mean frequency ( MNF ) of the MES ( McLean et al., J. Electrophysiol. Kinesiol. 10 ( 1 ) ( 2000 ). The data provided evidence ( p < 0.05 ) that all microbreak protocol s were associated with a higher frequency of MNF cycling at the neck when microbreaks were taken by the control and 40 min protocol groups.. The performance of both groups followed the same learning slope ( Group x Trial interactions were not significant ). St and ing appears to be a good rest from sitting given the reduction in passive tissue forces. The observed use of a treadmill walking group performed significantly worse for all measures of typing ( p<0.05."

The study was conducted to determine whether an intervention integrating environmental changes to induce sustained changes in physical activity, thereby reducing weight gain, among African-American girls. The intervention was conducted in three schools ( control, computer-based, and traditional education ). RESULTS The intervention, r and omized at school level, was design ed to promote physical activity by changing attitudes through debates and attractive activities, and by providing social support and environmental changes encouraging physical activity. Subjects : Nine hundred and fifty four 12-year-old children were enrolled in the intervention group than the control group ( weighted mean difference 0.3 portions/day, 95 % confidence interval 0.2 to 0.4 ). The percentage of students who walked to and from school increased in both the study and control schools.. The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimates that 1.9 million deaths worldwide are attributable to physical inactivity and at least 2.6 million deaths are a result of being overweight or obese. The three day diary showed that physical inactivity causes 10 % to 16 % of cases each of breast cancer, colon, and rectal cancers as well as type 2 diabetes. A two-stage model will be used to test the primary hypothesis. In the first stage, the authors found that total PA and physical activity were higher in children than in adults. In addition to being overweight / obese, WHO estimate that a total of 6.9% of deaths globally are due to PA. The literature suggests that abdominal obesity causes 10.9 % of the deaths and that 6.6% of these deaths are related to abdominal obesity. The incidence of abdominal obesity, bladder cancer, and abdominal cancers ( adjusted difference = -.63 cm, and 6 % of cancers, and 22 % of coronary heart disease and the burden of both these and other chronic diseases has rapidly increased in recent decades.

This cross-sectional study examined the relationship between the severity of diabetes, and the outcomes of diabetes. The study included 376 adults with diabetes, the prevalence of Diabetes, self-management, and glycaemic control. Subjects were assessed using both the SMMSE and MoCA for MCI. In all subjects, depression and dementia were ruled out using the DSM IV criteria, and a functional assessment was done. The instruments consisted of a sociodemographic and clinical st and ard.. The control group received standard care..., treatment group., health service utilization, socio-economic status and number of prescribed medications.. Results : Over time, patients with diabetes had significantly lower adherence to general diet, exercise, and glucose self-monitoring regimens  ( P < 0.01 ) and 2.3-fold increased odds of missing medication doses in the previous week. The positive and negative predictive values for MoCA were 84 % and 56 %, and for SMMSE were 66 % and 51 %, respectively. The overall study showed that the intervention group had better outcomes than the control group. The SEM showed a direct relationship between self-efficacy and self-reported outcomes ( β = 0.40 ; p <.001 ).. Predictors of poor self-regulation included older age, female sex, longer duration of diabetes and no report of hyperlipidemia. The variety of conditions seen in this study could help explain several of the barriers to self-Care behaviors. The outcomes of this systematic review was to examine the role of diabetes-concordant and discordant chronic conditions on the performance of self- care behaviors in adults with T2D.

The patients with diabetes were divided into two groups: control group ( n = 18 ) or a group receiving Ramadan-focused pre-education only ( [EUT]-diabetes education program ). The telemonitoring group was included the same as control group. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c values in both experimental and control groups. The control group received the usual care. The achievement of primary composite outcome ( four out of seven fasting plasma glucose [ FPG ] within 5 - 7.2 mmol/L + mean for three consecutive FPG within 5- 7.0 mmol/ L, and the hypoglycemic events ) was not observed. The mean ± SD of the glycemic control was significantly decreased in this study compared to controls. The study showed that the intervention group was significantly lower in hypoglycaemia, while minimizing the risk of insulin titration. The overall mortality rate was similar between the two study groups ( 2.07 [ 0, 4.78 ] and 2.6 [ 0.9 ], respectively ; P = 0.004 ). In the subgroup analysis, the mean glucose level was lower. The percentage of patients who achieved the primary endpoint was significantly greater than the control group.. The secondary endpoint was that diabetes treatment is a clinical syndrome from various causes, which happens when the blood glucose concentration is too low. Many studies show the effect of telehealth intervention on glycemic control and has a positive impact on the clinical outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to compare the impact of treatment with theoretical analysis on hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1C ) and.)."

METHODS We r and omized to : Usual Care ( UC ; quarterly visits with their primary care provider ) ; Brief Lifestyle Counseling ( BLC ; quarterly provider visits plus monthly weight loss counseling visits ). We used generalised estimating equations to assess characteristics associated with MOVE! participation, and Cox's proportional hazards regression to analyse the association between participation and diabetes incidence. RESULTS The intervention consisted of up to six face-to-face counseling sessions with a trained practice nurse, followed by three-monthly sessions by phone. We estimated cost per kilogram-year of weight loss and cost per QALY. The primary outcomes were diabetes incidence, CVD incidence and mortality, and all-cause mortality. The study determined that the incidence of severe retinopathy was 47 % lower in the intervention group than the control group ( hazard rate ratio 0.53, 95 % CI 0.29–0.99, p = 0.048 ). The cumulative quality -adjusted life-years ( QALYs ) accrued over 10 years were greater for lifestyle ( 0.80, 0.77 - 0.83 ) than metformin. The mean difference in costs between the study groups was 7 % for intervention participants versus 11 % in control participants. The number needed to treat to prevent one incident case of diabetes was 6.4 for LSM, 6.9 for MET and 6.5 for LSM + MET. Conclusions.

The aim of this study was to obtain consensus among experts about a set of generic core items for quality assessment of r and omized clinical trials. The study included 45 male cancer survivors that were referred to our institution. The initial item pool contained all items from existing criteria lists. Subsequently, we reduced the number of items by using the Delphi consensus technique. In-hospital post-operative morbidity and mortality were recorded. The data collected included body composition ( body weight and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scan ), aerobic capacity ( 12-minute walk ), and muscle strength ( 1 repetition maximum ). Main outcome measures European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Question naire ( EORTC QLQ-C30 ), Medical Outcomes Study Short Form ( MOS SF-36 ). The median adherence rate to exercise training of all 26 patients was 65 %, while in patients who were able to complete 12 weeks, adherence was 75 %. The fatigue score of all patients decreased from 66 to 43 post-intervention.. Colorectal cancer surgery results in considerable postoperative morbidity, mortality, and male sex, were seen more frequently in the severe complications group ( CCI ≥20 ). As many patients will undergo additional (neo)adjuvant therapy, it is imperative that each individual optimize their physical function. To eluci date the potential of exercise in patient optimization, we investigated the evidence for an exercise program before and after surgery... The overall quality of life of patients with rectal cancer patients during and after surgical treatment was excellent.. Cross-sectional study.).}}.) .).

32024269," Background : Occupational burnout is associated with severe negative health effects. While stress management programs proved to have a positive influence on the well-being of patients suffering from burnout, it remains unclear whether the effects of exercise on cognition and the long-term role of either behavior in early to middle adulthood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a 12-week aerobic training program performed at a moderate-vigorous intensity for patients with exhaustion disorder who participated in a multimodal rehabilitation program. Methods In this open-label, parallel, crossover study examined the interaction between exercise training, cognitive performance and type of burnout. The participants were asked about television-watching habits. After 12 weeks in the program the patients were r and omly allocated to either a mixed-grain or a regular diet.  Cognitive assessment s and measurements of plasma BDNF and S100B levels were performed at baseline and after the 6-week intervention.. The difference in plasma glucose after food consumption [ glucose > potatoes > placebo ( P : < 0.03 ) ] did not predict performance.. Although overall performance did not differ with exercise treatment, the presence of cognitive impairment was associated with a supplementary effect of the diet and in particular the Zone diet. The AA/EPA reduction was correlated with a concomitant decrease of insulin and homocysteine levels. The Zone diet reduced the baseline memory ( i.e., energy balance-related behavior ). The association between the two is currently not well understood.

The children were followed up to the age of 6 months. All mothers had unrestricted diet. The incidence of atopic diseases was assessed with the paper radioimmunosorbent test at 4 ages in the control group. The infants who had ever been breast fed had a lower incidence of asthma or wheeze than those who had not ( 59 % and 74 % respectively. The effect persisted to age 7 years. The occurrence of atopic eczema, recurrent wheezing, rhinitis, and eczema. At 2 years of age, there were significantly less cumulative incidence of atopy, but the difference between the 2 groups was not significant. The control group had similar incidence of eczema (.. ), the incidence of wheezing.. The infant formulas were similar. The parents were highly motivated and had the same age.

29930690," BACKGROUND Obesity associated with chronic kidney disease is a serious complication necessitating expenditure of huge medical efforts and re sources. This study investigates the role of alpha-lipoic acid ( ALA ) in end stage renal disease patients undergoing hemodialysis. We tested the effects of an oral antioxidant treatment ( alpha lipoic acid [ ALA ] ) on the biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation in patients with controlled non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ). METHODS This was a prospect i ve, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial. In all, 62 subjects were enrolled and were r and omly assigned to receive a combination of oral ALA ( 600 mg ), or a control group ( n = 32 ). After treatment, the renal function and serum level of CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α were compared between the two groups. We measured the plasma levels of cholesterol, albumin, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( HDL-C ), and tumor necrosis factor-α ( TN-α ), as well as routine laboratory parameters. RESULTS There were no significant differences in age, gender, duration of dialysis, and causative factor for dialysis between both groups ( P > 0.05 ). The mean of IL-8 and CRP after the intervention in case group was 26.20 ± 15.34 and 21.25 ± 9.61 ) and 15.7 for CRP ( p<0.05 ). The mean malondialdehyde and total antioxidant status levels did not change significantly in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS Vitamin E and ALA supplementation, especially their combination, might improve inflammation and malnutrition status among patients with metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) and related disorders."

We aim to study whether the use of risperidone in comparison with placebo in children with autistic disorder.. Methods This study was a post-hoc analysis of pooled data from two 8-week, double-blind, controlled trial of risperidone and placebo.. In this study, children with autism spectrum disorders were r and omized to receive either aripiprazole ( 5, 10, or 15 mg/day ) or placebo. The primary outcome measure was change in Aberrant Behavior Checklist ( ABC ), and changes in weight, and metabolic measures were evaluated. For subjects receiving aripiprazole, regardless of PAE, baseline weight, age, gender, and symptom severity were evaluated in a regression model predicting body weight change. Results. Patients who were taking risperidone ( mean dosage : 0.04 mg/kg/day ; 1.17 mg/ day ) experienced a significantly greater mean decrease on the irritability subscale of the ABC ( primary endpoint ) compared with those who were not receiving aripiprazole. By study endpoint, risperidone-treated subjects exhibited a 64 % improvement over placebo than with placebo from week 1 through week 8.. Aripiprazole demonstrated significantly greater global improvements than placebo, as assessed by the mean CGI-I score from week 6 to week 8 ; however, clinical ly significant residual symptoms may still persist for some patients. According to the discontinuation phase, the overall pooled relapse rate of aripiprazole was 10.6 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = 0.57.. The rates of pooled overall discontinuation and discontinuation due to adverse events were not different between the 2 groups in acute and long-term treatments."
27647000," Background Low back pain ( LBP ) is one of the most prevalent and expensive health care problems in industrialised countries. Aim. To assess the effectiveness of tailored  interventions ( multifaceted implementation strategy ) to implement the  Dutch low back pain guidelines. Methods General practice s were r and omised to either  access to a guideline for acute LBP.. We measured behavioural predictors ( e.g. knowledge, attitudes and intentions ) and the impact of different implementation strategies. The study was performed alongside a cluster r or omized controlled trial. The intervention group received the guidelines by mail ( st and ard passive method of dissemination ). The control group was offered education, the intervention group were offered additional active training strategy consisting of 2 sessions with education, group discussion, role playing, feedback, and reminders.. RESULTS Twenty-four centres were included in the study. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients with a guideline, treatment goals, and quality of life.. The effectiveness of a theory-based intervention  to increase adherence to the guideline for LBP patients was determined. The number of GPs available for analysis at 12 months was not significantly different. The timing of these interventions showed no differences between the 2 groups on any outcome measure during follow-up. In Group 1 ( control group ) neither the patients nor their family physicians received any information concerning the recommendations. The effect size of such a strategy, at an individual practitioner level, is not enough, and active implementation is needed. This review investigated the implementation strategies compared to minimal, single, or no implementation strategy for the management of non-specific low back and /or neck pain guidelines in health care. Conclusion : The implementation strategy was effective, but the additional upfront cost of implementing a guideline -consistent clinical practice was not enough.. For the optimal use of clinical guidelines in daily practice, mere distribution of guidelines and/or material s is not sufficient."

Sports participation increased fracture risk in boys and decreased risk in girls. Television viewing had a deleterious dose response association with wrist and forearm fractures while light physical activity was protective. INTRODUCTION The aim of this population -based case control study was to examine the association between television, computer, and video viewing ; types and levels of physical activity..  Dietary intake was controlled and monitored. Urinary calcium and markers of bone resorption were measured before bed rest and on bed rest days 5/6, 12/13, 19/20, and 26/27. Bone mineral content was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry before and after bed rest. Data were analyzed by repeated- measures two-way analysis of variance..

Numerous reports in the literature describe outcomes in patients with degenerative and posttraumatic arthrosis and rheumatoid disease. This has led to results that are difficult to interpret. In this report, the second of three on surgical innovation and evaluation, we discuss obstacles related to the study design of r and omised controlled total ankle arthroplasty.  The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle score and radiostereometric radiographs  were evaluated. The LCS ( low contact stress ) prosthesis was used initially, in nineteen ankles, between 1988 and 1992, and the Buechel-Pappas design, was used in seventy-four ankles between 1993 and 1999.. The mean time to followup was 28 ( 12 to 67 ) months. The modified FFI ( range, 0 to 100, a high score meaning more pain and disability ) improved significantly from 59 before to 35 after surgery. The overall success, all of the following criteria needed to be met. At the time of followup, 45 prostheses survived, while four replacements had failed.

30383133," BACKGROUND In the ARISTOTLE trial, the risk of stroke or systemic embolism was reduced by apixaban compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF ). We hypothesized that the efficacy and safety of apixaban therapy were superior to warfarine therapies for stroke and all-cause death. We performed a post-hoc analysis of the randomized controlled trial of apixaban, a r and omized to apixaban... The primary efficacy outcome was stroke or thromboembolism, and the secondary outcomes were mortality.. In this systematic review, patients were enrolled in the RE-LY trial.. the primary outcome was the proportion of patients with AF. The secondary outcome was  the incidence of stroke.. Patients with AF, these patients were more likely to be male ( 75 vs. 57 % ), on aspirin at baseline ( 47 vs. 34 % ).. Of the trial population, 30 % were < 65 years, 39 % were 65 to < 75, and 31 % were ≥75 years. The rates of stroke, total bleeding, and 1.08 % with apixaban. A significantly higher proportion of AF patients experienced stroke ( 23.1 vs. 13.3 % ; p<0.001 for all ). The main outcomes and Measures Within-trial re source use and cost were compared between treatments, using externally derived US cost weights.. Life expectancies for US patients were estimated at 1.6 ( 2.1, 3.0 ) ; 78.5 % of patients had a previous stroke ( n=4907 ) and 687 ( 48 % ) had a prior stroke or TIA. The overall mortality rate was 1.26 %.. stroke and mortality were similar to those without AF, but the rate of stroke and non-cardiovascular mortality were lower than those.. oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists ( VKAs ) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and according to estimates, 12.1 million Americans will have AF.. Oral anticoagulants ( DOACs ) is characterized by uncoordinated atrial activation with consequent deterioration of mechanical function.. This trial was characterized by higher risk for stroke, heart failure, and overall mortality ( 35 ). Stroke related to AF have been characterized as more severe ( 6 )."
19496021,". Quality of life ( QoL ) is becoming increasingly important for evaluating the impact of disease, and for assessing the efficacy of treatments. However, individuals change with time and the basis on which they make a QoL judgement may also change, a phenomenon increasingly referred to as response shift. The population s were long-term survivors of HL ( n=121 ) and a control group ( n = 236 ). The PGI was completed by 359 patients presenting with low back pain. The validity of the measure was assessed by correlating patients'PGI scores with a well-vali date d health profile, the Short-Form 36-item Health Survey ( SF-36 ), and with their scores on a clinical back pain question naire.. The results showed that to the degree now current prospect i ve instruments reflect a purely physical perspective of "" disease burden "" irrespective of social conditions they create a context that works against life quality.. Individually measured QoL was significantly increased after surgery when measured by SEIQoL ( p less than 0.05 )... There was a clear correlation between the ALSFRS,  the SIP, and to a lesser extent the SF-6. The health variables did not correlate with the quality of life. The majority of patients' perceptions of QoL were positive aspects, e.g. a changed view of life and oneself."
32111637," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of psychological interventions for patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures ( PNES ).  Some psychotherapies have been shown to improve PNES and comorbid symptom outcomes. We evaluated a pharmacologic intervention to test the overlap of PTSD with other psychiatric disorders and medical problems. Patients were r and omized to immediate or delayed ( 9 months ) withdrawal of AEDs.  We recorded spell frequency, changes in work status, use of emergency medical services, and psychological status at baseline, 9 months, and 18 months. RESULTS Of 193 patients screened, 38 fulfilled entry criteria, 13 declined participation.  Medical care utilization was obtained from automated encounter data for the year preceding the index visit. Medical morbidity was indexed with a computerized medical record audit.. The two- sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to show the differences in relative frequencies of fits between the two groups. METHOD 44 patients with FNS completed question naires including the EPS-25 and measures of clinical symptomology ( health-related quality of life ( SF-36 ), somatic symptoms ( PHQ-15 ), psychological distress ( CORE-10 ) and illness underst and ing ( BIPQ ).. After a review three months later by a psychiatrist, patients receiving a scripted diagnosis and psychiatric consultation demonstrated decreased PNES frequency accompanied by improved quality of Life ( QOL ). Patients also receiving weekly phone calls not only demonstrated decreased PES frequency and improvements in QOL but also exhibited improved mood. CONCLUSIONS We did not observe significant group difference in seizure frequency/intensity, patients from the intervention group showed significant improvement on the Work and Social Adjustment Scale ( WSAS ). We aim ed to identify existing outcome measures for functional neurological disorder ( FND ), to inform the development of recommendations and to guide future research on FND outcomes."

STUDY DESIGN : Prospect i ve r and omized placebo-controlled trial. The children were enrolled and a total of ninety-seven non-breastfed term infants were enrolled to receive either Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 55730 ( at dose of 1 x 10(8 ) colony forming units a day ) or placebo for 28 days. The mothers completed the study. Clinical symptoms of gastrointestinal function ( regurgitation, vomiting, inconsolable crying, and evacuation ) and physiological variables ( gastric electrical activity and emptying ) were recorded before and after the dietary intervention. RESULTS : Seventy-five of 127 ( 59 % ) traced infant-parent dyads participated. There were no significant differences in baseline demographic characteristics, infant crying or maternal stress between the groups... Infants who participated had a significant decrease of crying duration of 63 minutes per day.., and crying time were significantly higher in infants with colic than in controls ( P<0.05 ).. The rate of responders to treatment was significantly higher than the placebo group at day 7 ( P =.026 ), at day 14 ( relative risk ( RR ) 4.3, 95 % CI 2.3 - 8.7 ).

Methods In a double-blind r and omized trial, participants ( females : n = 90, mean age 64.8, SD 4.3 years ) were assigned ( computer generated, double blind ) to receive supervised exercise training or placebo for 10 days to induce muscle soreness in the hamstrings.. Results : Thirty-nine healthy male university students ( age = 18.8 ± 0.4 years, maximal oxygen consumption = 55.5 ± 5.9 mL·kg(-1)·min(-1 ). We studied 17 healthy male volunteers who regularly ran as a source of exercise. During the study they ingested either 650 mg of ibuprofen or placebo. The total amount of ibuprofen consumed by a single individual was 2800 mg... Muscle soreness was not an appropriate treatment for delayed onset muscle soreness ( DOMS ), although the placebo and control groups ( P = 0.05 ). The overall incidence of muscle soreness was significantly lower for placebo and were comparable with tramadol.. The ibuprofen group had no effects on aBMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total body. On days 4 and 7, more patients had significantly more pain at 24 and 48 h compared with at baseline. The CK values increased ( P < 0.001 ) in these athletes. There may also be some abuse of these substances, although it is unclear whether NSAIDs in fact enhance performance. We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to evaluate the effect of NSAIDs on sport performance indices..).

Methods and Results — A prospect i ve cohort of patients with normal and abnormal LV function underwent ablation for AF. The authors evaluated patients with AF and symptomatic LV dysfunction ( PVI ) and PVI plus left linear lesions ( LL ). We compared these patients with a matched cohort treated medically for AF and LV dysfunction.  LAV was calculated on the basis of computed tomography images at baseline and after 12-month follow-up. The primary end point was AAD-free AF elimination at 1 year after ablation. The patients were followed up every 3 months during the first year after discharge and every 6 months in the second year.. After 24 months, the LA posterior wall was isolated by adding a second line connecting the inferior aspect of the 2 inferior PVs ( CPVA-2 group ). The study included 120 patients ( 53.1 % ) with AF.. The mean ± SD of AF recurrence was 55.6 ± 6.2 vs. 52.4 ± 5.5, P = 0.03 ). In the RFA group, there was a greater increase in EF ( 74 % [ 95 % CI, 65%–82 % ] ) than patients of group 2 ( 61 % [ 51%–70 % ] ; P=0.031 ). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in group 1 patients demonstrated a significant improvement in LV systolic function ( 46 % vs. 23 %, P < 0.001 )... We performed this meta- analysis to assess safety and long-term outcome of AFCA in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, to evaluate predictors of recurrence and impact on LV function."
22430458," OBJECTIVES : To examine the language development at corrected age 4 years of a regionally representative cohort of children born very preterm ( VPT ). Of particular interest was the identification of biological and socioenvironmental risk and protective factors that influence  VPT children's early language development. Method : Data were collected as part of a prospect i ve longitudinal study of 110 VPT ( vPT : ≤33 weeks gestation ) and 113 full-term children ( full term : 37–41 years gestation ) born in Canterbury . Hierarchical growth modeling was used to explore differences in language trajectories. RESULTS : From 3 to 12 years, preterm children displayed catch-up gains on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised. Preterm children started with an average st and ardized score of 84.1 at 3 years and gained 1.2 points per year across the age period studied. Growth-curve analyses of Peabodies Picture Vocabular Test-R raw scores revealed an indomethacin-gender effect on initial scores at 3 weeks, with preterm boys assigned r and omly to receive indometHacin scoring, on average, 4.2 point higher than placebo-treated boys. However, the velocity of receptive vocabulary development from 3 through 12 years did not differ for the two treatment groups. Children with severe brain injury demonstrated slower gains in skills over time, compared with those who did not suffer severe brain damage. Significant differences in child development were predicted by maternal education and minority status. CONCLUSION : Although indometracin yielded an initial benefit for preterm boys, this intervention did not alter the developmental trafficory of receptive language scores. Severe brain injury leads to long-term sequelae in language development, whereas a socioeconomically advantaged environment supports better language development among preterm children. It is unknown whether these problems decrease, deteriorate, or remain stable over the course. The goal of this research was to determine the development course of language functions in preterm-born children from 3-to 6 years of age."
21404024," A prospect i ve study to compare the fixation of a cemented total hip arthroplasty. In 329 patients ( 76 cemented, 71 cementless ) were followed prospect ively for two to four years.. The mean age of the patients at operation was 52 years ( 28 to 81 ). None were lost to follow-up. In the 23 patients who had died ( 26 hips ) only one acetabular component was considered unstable. The cemented hips were followed to date ( 10 cases ). No components were radiographically loose, and 3 ( 7 % ) had pelvic osteolysis. The 2 groups were similar with respect to age and sex. The cementless acetabular component  wore at a mean rate of 0.15 mm per year and the cemented acetabular component. The postoperative period was uneventful. The femoral component was not significantly different ( p < 0.0001 ). There were three patients with Charnley prostheses ( 6.7 % ) and 14 patients with HP-Garches prostheses ( 18 % ) that had revision surgery to correct mechanical loosening... No significant difference in migration between the two design s of acetabular components ( p = 0.98 ), 14 ( 6 % ) were class II, 8 ( 3 % )were class III and none were class IV. Conclusion Total hip arthroplasty has been a very succesful orthopaedic procedure. The optimal fixation method of this acetabular component however, has not yet been defined."
32314257," BACKGROUND Bariatric surgery is associated with several anatomo-physiological modifications that may affect pharmacokinetic parameters and consequently alter the therapeutic effect of drugs, such as antibiotics. The Cochrane Collaboration ’s tool for assessing risk of bias aims to make the process clearer and more accurate.BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of bariatric surgery on the pharmacokinetics of  amoxicillin. Methods This study was performed as a r and omized, open-label, single-dose clinical trial, with two periods of treatment, in which obese subjects ( n = 8) received an amoxicillin 500 mg capsule orally before and 2 months after the RYGB surgery. The  amoxicillin plasma concentration was determined by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ). Results After the surgery, the mean weight loss was 17.03 ± 5.51 kg, and mean body mass index ( BMI ) decreased from 46.21 ± 2.82 to 38.82 ± 3.32 kg/m2. The mean amoxicillin area under the plasmaentration versus time curve from time zero to the day of the last quantifiable concentration ( AUC0–tlast ) increased significantly ( 3.5-fold ) ; the maximum plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) were 46.2 ± 1.4 mg · h/L after oral dosing and 52.3 ± 1,3 mg · kg/L following intravenous dosing, result ing in the incidence of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension were undetectable. CONCLUSIONS As compared with conventional therapy, bariatric surgeries appears to be a viable option for the management of severe obesity, result in long-term weight loss, improved lifestyle, and, except for hypercholesterolemia, amelioration in risk factors that were elevated at baseline.

In this prospect i ve study, we used three different techniques for TKA. The purpose of this study was to identify typical patterns of bone tracer uptake ( BTU ) or gap balancing ( n = 51 ). Primary outcome measures were knee-line change, the type and location of femoral component. The secondary outcomes measured were femoral component position and the functional outcome. The knee joint line positions were measured using preoperative and postoperative weight-bearing anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. The clinical and radiological follow-up was 24 months. The patients were grouped into two groups with regard to their preoperative limb alignment. The femoral component was also compared with the measured resection technique, ( P = 0.008 ). The mean postoperative knee angle was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Condylar liftoff, contact location, and magnitude of excursion on each condyle were measured. The postoperative knee joint angle was also assessed. The total excursion at 20 ° was significantly higher in the GB group compared to both the TKA, and after 2 years ( P < 0.05 ).. The gait analysis showed that the femoral component had more posterior contact on the medial condyle ( P > 0.01 ) and more anterior contact at the lateral condyle. The ratio of varus to valgus was also significantly higher.. A comprehensive systematic review of literature was performed to present current evidence on how to optimally place the knee component in TKA."
26146874," BACKGROUND : Recent studies have suggested that heterogeneity in the level of dopamine receptor activity and function might be useful for the treatment of cocaine dependence. The opioid receptor ( DRD4 ) single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ). The study was conducted double blind and subjects'order of dose exposure was r and omized. The objective of this human laboratory study was to measure the relationship between antibody titers and the effects of alcohol ( placebo, 1 or 2 mg/kg ). RESULTS : Participants consumed 3 alcoholic drinks or 3 control drinks and completed measures of craving  after each drink... The participants were divided into 2 groups.. : The placebo group and those who were homozygous for a single amino acid substitution ( A/A ) were compared. The average and maximum daily methadone dose during the first year of treatment were compared to the placebo.. Results In the entire cohort 277 participants achieved long term cessation of cocaine, and 228 died.. There was a negative significant linear trend showing decreased plasma nicotine ( p < 0.02 ) and cotinine ( p = 0.005 ). Substance use disorders have an immediate ( within 4 minutes of cocaine smoking ) and robust ( 55%-81 % ) reduction in ratings of good drug effect and cocaine quality. It is essential that each component is represented in treatment plans. The dopaminergic system plays a critical role in treating substance use disorders, and an underst and ing of the role of variation of genes involved in this system is essential for its success."
18199086," BACKGROUND : To investigate the effect of feeding different infant formulas on the incidence of atopic disease in the first 2 years of life. The infants were randomized to receive either a casein hydrolysate ( Nutramigen ) or a new ultrafiltrated whey hydrolysate ( Profylac ). The children were followed up from birth to 6 years of age. All mothers had unrestricted diet.. None of the infants had biparental or severe single atopic predisposition, the latter combined to their siblings and another nonrelated control group. The cumulative incidence of atopy symptoms at 18 months was 51, 64, and 84 % in  the N, PH, and RM groups. The comparison group ( 824 infants ) was composed of infants who were exclusively breast-fed. The mothers were followed for 18 to 34 months of age, and the children were not advised about environmental factors. The primary endpoint was a challenge-proven adverse reaction to CM. The parents were highly motivated and compliance was good. The rate of atopic symptoms was not statistically different between the two groups... The incidence of asthma was significantly lower than the control group ( 1.41, 1.14 to 1.76 ). The occurrence of both eczema and asthma was lowest in those who received breast milk exclusively for at least 15 weeks, with a relative risk of 1.19. The majority of infants ( 83 % ) had a positive skin prick test.. The relationship of breast feeding to atopic disease was significant.A+."
27769955," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of three interventions to reduce diabetes distress ( DD ) and improve self-management among type 2 diabetes. This study evaluated the efficacy of a guided web-based intervention in reducing the burden of diabetes... The intervention was a 6-month parallel group randomized controlled trial ( N = 62 ) comparing the effects of the computer intervention with usual care. The participants with diabetes who had hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) levels of ≥9.0 %. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 761 participants were r and omized to the Internet-based diabetes intervention or the control group. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms severity ( CES-D ). The secondary outcomes were diabetes-specific emotional distress ( Problem Areas in Diabetes [ PAID ] scale ) and participant satisfaction. This sample included 110 American Indians/Alaska Natives ( AI/ANs ). There was, however, a significant group × baseline distress interaction ( P < 0.02 ), in which patients with high baseline RD in the intervention group had significantly larger RD reductions than those in two control groups. There were no significant changes in other health or behavioral indicators. CONCLUSIONS The basic D-Net intervention was implemented well and improvements were observed across a variety of patients, those who used the site more regularly derived significantly greater benefits from the program. Given the scarcity of traditional psychological support and the barriers to uptake of and attendance at face-to-face education programs, Web-based interventions are becoming a popular approach to provide an additional platform for psychological support in long-term conditions. However, there is limited evidence to assess the effect of Web-mediated interventions on the quality of life of people with diabetes.Conclusion This systematic review is the first review to critically appraise and quantify the evidence on whether or notARC-/.)."

Methods The study was a prospect i ve cohort study with an observation period of 10 months. The intervention consisted of a computer mouse with a feedback signal. The participants were assigned consecutively to one of three groups : ergonomics intervention ( work site and body posture adjustments, muscle activity training and exercises ) and a control group. The remainder comprised the "" no stretching "" ( control ) group. Results Of the 6,359 articles retrieved, 16 r and omized controlled trials were eligible for critical appraisal and five were admissible. We found that a return-to-work coordination program ( including workplace-based work hardening ) was superior to usual care.. Improvements in neck and shoulder pain did not differ between the two groups. The working group follows the steps of PE in which the most important risk factors for LBP and NP. The baseline frequency of headache ( days per month ) was 5.87 and 6.30 in the study group and in controls. The implementation of ergonomic measures at the department is performed by the working group.. The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of neck/shoulder disorders ( HR = 0.49, 95 % CI 0.04 to 0.97 ). In the multivariable analyses, the intervention group was significantly associated with reduced incidence of symptoms in all body regions ( RR = 1.5–1.9 for low comfort and 1.8–2.1 for females, respectively ). The burden of disabling musculoskeletal pain and injuries ( MSDs ) arising from work-related causes in many workplaces remains substantial. There is little consensus on how to prevent and manage MSDs. Our objective was to up date a systematic review of workplaces-based interventions for preventing and managing  upper extremity MSD ( UEMSD )."

The placebo group showed no significant differences, but, when analyzed separately, groups consuming high phytoestrogen diets had between 10 and 30 times higher urinary excretion of phytoestrogens compared to those consuming the low phytoestrogenic diet ( p < 0.01 ).. In particular, women taking soy extract had a 38 % reduction in the mean number the day of menopause. The use of herbs, particularly black cohosh, multibotanical supplements, and dietary soy for menopausal symptoms has grown dramatically (. ). The study showed that the efficacy of soy extract compared with placebo was significant, the number of women who tolerated the treatment was not the same. The menopause symptoms, such as hot flushes, night sweats, are very common during the menopausal transition.. Conclusion : Hormone replacement therapy has traditionally been used as a very effective treatment but concerns over high levels of phytochemicals and/or and/ or the use of phytotherapies alone may not be applicable to women with hot flushes or night sweats in postmenopausal women./A.-)., .."
28368091," BACKGROUND This study examined whether staff members'use of interventions for preventing patients'aggression  reduced the number of incidents of aggression on a long-term care facility with schizophrenia, the clinical meaning of its total score and of the cut-offs that are used to define treatment response. This cross-sectional survey of English adults included data on a range of lifestyle risk factors and health outcomes. For the survey, households were sample d in 720 postal code sectors nested within 177 district health authorities and 14 regional health authorities. Study subjects were adults aged 16 years or more.  ICCs and components of variance were estimated from a nested r and om-effects analysis of variance. Results are presented at the district health authority, postal code sector, and household levels. Between-cluster variation was evident at each level of clustering. In these data, ICCs were inversely related to cluster size. The study provided preliminary evidence for the potential for therapeutic touch in dealing with agitated behaviors by people with dementia.  Simulated presence, but not music, result ed in significantly reduced counts of verbally agitated behaviors. The placebo tape proved more effective than expected. A marginally significant difference in the severity of aggressive incidents was found between experimental and control wards. For binary outcomes, we calculated st and ard estimates of relative risk ( RR ) and their 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ). De-escalation is a psychosocial intervention for managing people with disturbed or aggressive behaviour.. Of the two psychosocial treatments, preferred music tapes were easier to make and were clearly helpful in many instances... There was no significant difference for most outcomes except the one trial that compared benzodiazepines with placebo, regardless of whether this is behaviourally or verbally expressed.. It was unclear whether the effects of de-escalation techniques in this study were real orOCA-+)/.).."
32340106," OBJECTIVES To evaluate the influence of different etching procedures of the post-surface on microtensile bond strength to root dentin. MATERIAL S AND METHODS Fifty single-rooted teeth were divided into 10 subgroups using five different chemical surface treatments and two composite material s to build-up the abutment. The roots were r and omly divided into 6 experimental and 2 control groups : ParaCore ( PAR ), Paracore + silane ( PAR-SIL ), RelyX Unicem ( RXU ) ; and group 4 Nd : YAG + Er, Cr : YSGG lasers. The fiber posts were cemented with an adhesive system + resin cement. Sealing ability was quantified with a fluid-filtration system ( Flodec ) during 10 min, after which the posts were placed in a light-proof container with 100 % relative humidity for 24 h. The specimens were transversally sectioned. The bond strengths were determined using a universal testing machine ( 0.5 mm/min ). The effect of different posts and cements on the force required to dislodge the dowels was evaluated with multiple analyses of variance ( ANOVA ).. The data were statistically analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test. The fractured specimens were observed to the interface between the dentin and the resin in all groups. RESULTS Mean failure load values for each ground were PAR 247.4 ± 59.3 N, PAR-SEM 240.5 ± 68.8 N, RXU-SIL 106.4 +/- 19.8 Nm, RXA 119.8 ± 27.3. The push-out test demonstrated a more homogenous stress distribution by FEA and less variability in mechanical testing. The most frequent failure mode occurred at the cement/dentin interface. CONCLUSION Silane application may be necessary to improve the adhesion of fiber posts to dentine."

We use a r and omly assigned to the treatment group began receiving the BDH  in 2004 ( May, 2004 ), and these result ed in vaccination levels greater than 95 % for some children. Our data include a set of measures of cognitive ability that are not typically included in experimental or quasi-experimental studies of children to be enrolled in these communities. Cash transfer programs, microcredit, user fee removal policies and voucher schemes that provide direct or indirect monetary incentives to households have been used for decades in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and more recently in Southeast Asia. Until now, no systematic review of the effect of financial incentives on coverage and uptake of child health interventions targeting children under 5 years of age has been conducted. The objective of this review is to provide estimates on the number of children under the age of six types of financial incentive programs : ( i ) Unconditional cash transers ( CT ), ( ii ) Conditional payments ( CT ), ( iii ) Microcredit ( MC ), but there were no effects on height-for-age z-score or hemoglobin concentration in rural or urban areas. A limited number of potential pathways with respect to cognitive/ language stimulation, health behaviors, and overall health outcomes were also explored. Findings indicate that compared to children in comparison areas, rural children in treatment areas were more likely to have received vitamin A or iron supplementation and have been bought a total."

MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 56 implants were installed in 62 patients out of 66 patients. All patients received a temporary restoration ( single crown or two to four unit fixed partial denture ) out of occlusal contact. After a healing period of 3 weeks, all implants were functionally loaded with a screw-retained crown or fixed dental prosthesis. The patients were recalled at weeks 4, 7, 12, and 26 for monitoring and assessment of clinical and radiological parameters, including implant stability. The implant survival and radiographic parameters were recorded and compared to a historic control group of implants with an SLA surface. The implants were tested for evidence of clinical mobility by attempting to rotate or move the implant with an application of force. The mean patient age was 46.3 years. After 3 years, 49 patients ( 194 implants ) were healed. In the first 6 weeks, 6.3 % were clinical ly mobile. The majority of the implants were successfully treated outside the protocol. The overall survival rate was 98.55 % and the mean bone level was 2.44 + /- 1.20 mm. After that, the average bone level at baseline was 1.63±0.78 and at 1 and 3 years.

The mean follow up was 12.4 months ( range 4.5 - 27 ). All patients who received a stem revision procedure in our hospital were included within this study. We believe that navigated short modular stems are safe for the hip arthroplasty. On radiographic analysis we recorded good neck preservation and osteointegration. Only two patients had died and one patient underwent revision surgery due to aseptic loosening of the stem. There was considerable improvement in Harris Hip Score ( HHS ), the  Charnley hip score , and the postoperative Harris hip score. We identified 2 patients with significant radiolucent lines and subsidence, even after the surgeons demonstrated technical proficiency. We made a systematic summary of reported overall survival after this type of surgery. The lack of cortical BD loss and increase of contact area values below the level of fixation. The revision surgery between 2 and 10 mm was present in 7 patients ( 29 % ). This design might become an alternative to st and ard stems and to make minimally invasive approaches easier.. The survival rate analysis according to Kaplan-Meier at 13 years was 89.4 % ( TPP ) and 53.6 % at 66 months ( ESKA Cut ).

The restorations were evaluated clinical ly, radiographically and from colour photographs. The success rate of the restorations was assessed by using the modified USPHS criteria. The mean survival of all single- and multiple-surface restorations was 17.2 % with annual failure rates of 10.0 %. The study revealed a 3-year cumulative survival percentage of single-surface ART and MTA restorations of 86.1 and 79.6 %, respectively. The difference was statistically significant ( p = 0.03 ). The reason for both the replacement rate was 5.8 percent of compomers versus 4.0 percent of amalgams, tooth extracted for orthodontic reasons. The specimens were su bmi tted to a pH-cycling model. The majority of restorations were successful. The incidence of caries was lower than the literature in order to investigate the longevity of primary teeth restorations."
30387072," Background This study showed that the effect of exercise training on health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) and additional jumping training. The finding supports the idea that it is possible to maintain good physical functioning by multi-component exercise program and thus postpone the age-related functional problems. Methods This 1-year r and omized, controlled exercise intervention trial assessed the effects of two different training programs and their combination on physical functioning and bone in older adults.. Results : Forty-two community-dwelling older women aged 70–78 years were r or omly assigned to either an exercise program of combined upper body resistance exercise and either high-dose impact-loading ( HI ; 80 jumps per session ) or moderate-dose jump ( CMJ ). The training program for both experimental groups had a warm-up, effective training and a cooling down periods. The baseline differences were observed among groups. Compared with the CG, the exercise group showed similar small to moderate improvements ( P<0.05 ) in muscle strength ( 5 maximum repetitions [ 5RMs ] ), functional performance, and at a 6-month postintervention follow-up.. The intervention consisted of 5–7 sets of 10 s timed bilateral hopping exercise at 75–90 % intensity three times/week. There was no significant group × time interaction for GRF, OI and JH ( P = 0.065 )... Muscle activity and absolute RFD measures were not influenced by the intervention. The aging process is associated with a progressive decline of neuromuscular function, increased risk of falls and fractures, and loss of independence. The addition of jumping to strength, stretching and aerobic exercises provides important contributions to balance improvement and fall risk reduction. Practitioner Summary: The rehabilitation of older adults with plyometric training may mitigate or even reverse the decline of strength, impaired gait, and fractures. The rehabilitation process is related to the safety and efficacy of plyometric exercises to improve."
27997978," A single-blind clinical trial compared the efficacy of a fixed triple combination with 0.05 mg reserpine and the combination of hydrochlorothiazide ( P+T ), a vasodilator ( dihydro-ergocristine 0.5 mg ) and reserpine ( 0.1 mg ). The patients received either a low ( 25 - 50 mg ) or high ( 50 - 100 mg ) dose of reserpine, or placebo. The patient subgroup of 34 patients followed the protocol. The mean decrease in diastolic blood pressure ( BP ) to below 90 mm Hg and at least 5 mm Hg less than baseline. The four groups did not differ regarding baseline characteristics ( mean age, 58 years ; 51 % men ; mean BP after a 2-week placebo period than the preceding week ; and, at the end of week 6, both groups attained control of at least 90 mmHg. The scores of the treatment group were significantly decreased, whereas the placebo group. The dose-related blood pressure reductions were not significant.. The study suggests that the dose of this agent was not the same as the other agents. The trial population was 43.1 % male, 56.9 % female, and -11.6/-11.9 mm Hg, respectively ( 2P <.01 ). The study refutes the common belief that reserpine treatment of primary hypertension ( systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood Pressure ≥ 90 mmHg, or both ). The clinical trials ( RCTs ) have not been carried out to investigate the evidence for these agents. There is, for example, strong RCT evidence that no treatment is superior to reserpine as a second-line therapy. We conclude that both trials used reserpine to treat hypertension... to analyze the effects of reserpine  on mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) and diastolic pressure ( DBP )..

26512340," BACKGROUND Previous studies have found that moderate intensity exercise is an effective intervention strategy for preventing falls  in older adults. However, the extent to which exercise training may reduce the incidence of falls, to the optimal exercise components, as well as the working mechanisms that underlie the effectiveness of these programs, have not been systematic ally evaluated. Four groups in 2 x 2 design : Control, Balance, Strength, Balance + Strength, using blinded testers. The study was conducted to determine whether participation in a weekly group exercise program for the elderly people. The participants were aged 65 years or older, who had either a hospital admission or bed rest for 2 days or more within the previous month. The primary outcome measure was the number of falls. The secondary outcome measures included: ( 1 ) the proportion of falls ; the primary outcome measures were the percentage of fallers, and the gait speed. The follow-up data were collected every 4 months for 1 year... The outcomes included: 1) the rate of falls; 2) The number of participants who were able to complete the study. 3)  The study showed that the exercise group had a higher rate of recovery. The exercise group was significantly lower than the control group ( p <.05 ). The recovery rate of gait speed was higher in the intervention group ( 2.0 % to 3.0%). The intervention group had the greatest relative change in gait speed ( p =.0001 ), but the group did not achieve the same level of recovery. The study did not show that low-intensity exercise interventions ( 1.5 metabolic equivalent tasks ( METs ) to 6.0 METs. The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the impact of low-moderate exercise interventions on physical and cognitive health of older adults.A-R/+).."

26708317," Background Modafinil is a selective wakefulness-promoting agent that has been shown to enhance cognitive performance under conditions of sleep deprivation. This not only increases the likelihood of mistakes during surgery but also puts pressure on surgeons to use drugs to counteract fatigue, distress, concentration deficits, and even hallucinations. In a double-blind parallel group design study, we have reported that modafinil improves cognitive task performance in healthy volunteers, they completed an extensive cognitive battery. The 3 groups did not differ in self-ratings of sleepiness or tiredness before the testing session, and there were no treatment-associated changes in these or in mood ratings. This observation raises the question as to whether this enhancement of cognitive tests. The placebo group and the 200-mg group were compared in the same cognitive tasks. The study was conducted in a randomized controlled trial. The alerting action, and imaging response, to a single oral dose of the sleep-preventing drug modafinil. The group treated with modafinil ( 200 mg ) was significantly faster in a simple colour naming task. Modafinil only improved cerebral serotonin, glutamate, orexin, and histamine levels. In the placebo group. The rs-fMRI modifications that we have found are consistent with the drug cognitive enhancing properties and indicate that the cognitive effects of modafinil on the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate.

28110383," BACKGROUND : The incidence of right colonic diverticulitis ( RCD ) is rare in Western countries. This study assessed the risk of recurrence and treatment failure after a first episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis. We have undertaken a multicentre, r and omised, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study in order to evaluate the role of mesalazine in preventing diverticulitis recurrence as well as its effects on symptoms associated to diverticular disease. Methods Of the 154 patients admitted as right colon diverticulitis between February 2004 and March 2012, 104 patients were enrolled, prospect ively. The recurrence rate, size, multiplicity, location, diagnostic criteria score, and predisposing factors were evaluated based on Hinchey ’s classification of diverticulitis. The primary efficacy end point was the recurrence at intention to treat analysis. Clinical evaluations were performed using the Therapy Impact Question naire ( TIQ ) for physical condition and quality of life at admission and at 3-month intervals. RESULTS Seven patients were excluded from final evaluation because they were lost to follow-up. Fifty-five group A patients ( mean age, 61.5 ) were coded based on a retrospective chart review. Univariate analysis of variables in relation to recurrent disease was performed by a log-rank test of Kaplan-Meier estimates. The average follow up was 62 ( Q1 to Q3 : 28–98 ) months. After resolution of the index episode, 22 patients [ 30.1 % ( 95 % CI, 19.6%–40.6 % ) ] experienced a recurrent episode of diverticulitis at a median of 23 ( range, 9–40 ) months, and 1.4 % of them underwent emergency surgery. Conclusion The rate of severe recurrence after successful nonoperative management of acute diverticulitis was low, and emergency surgery was rare. Prophylactic surgery, even in cases of recovered severe diverticulitis, should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Complicated recurrence after an episode of acute colon diverticulitis...

Design : A four-year follow-up of a r and omized trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a functional restoration program, including intensive physical training, occupational technapy, and psychological support to the original rehabilitation program. Methods : A prospect i ve clinical trial with parallel groups was undertaken in severely disabled patients ( n = 71, age 73 ± 5 years ). Subjects : Two hundred and seven elderly stroke patients admitted between December 1999 and February 2001. The patients with a profile group as interpersonally distressed had statistically significant higher change scores on occupational performance than the adaptive coper group. Furthermore, increases in changes on general activity level, general health, and vitality and decreases in pain severity were associated with positive changes on the Nottingham extended activities of daily living scale. Results : Six-min walk ( 6MWD ) with evaluation of BORG dyspnea ( D ) and leg fatigue ( F ) scores at end of effort, and this is not statistically significant ( mean difference in cost per case 542 pounds, 95 % CI 434 - 1,519 pounds ).

19533517," A prospect i ve longitudinal study employing repeated measures was used to isolate factors which might predispose a person to depression two years after sustaining spinal cord injury. The usual criterion is at least moderate pain on a categorical pain intensity scale. When visual analogue scales ( VAS ) are the only pain measure in trials we need to know what point on a VAS represents moderate pain, so that these trials can be included in meta‐ analysis when baseline pain of at leastmoderate intensity is an inclusion criterion. To investigate this we used individual patient data from 1080 patients from r and omised controlled trials of various analgesics.  Baseline pain was measured using a 4‐point categorical score and a pain intensity VAS under identical conditions. The distribution of the VAS scores was examined for 736 patients reporting moderate pain and for 344 reporting severe pain.  Pain management and rehabilitation techniques that enhance the individual's belief of control over their lives are therefore recommended as interventions that could act to reduce depression in the long term after their surgery : morphine, ketorolac, or placebo.

29637113," BACKGROUND : The use of probiotics is a common and severe complication in preterm infants. We aim ed to evaluate the incidence and severity of necrotising enterocolitis ( NEC ) and to assess the efficacy of probiotic supplementation. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on preterm infants who were r and omized to receive either probiotic or placebo. The probiotic group ( n=83 ) was supplemented with Lactobacillus reuteri ( L. rhamnosus ). The demographic parameters, risk factors for NEC and outcome including incidence of NEC, its severity, sepsis and mortality were evaluated. The intervention group was composed of 119 infants who received a dose of 1.6 x 10(8 ) cells of B. breve. The average birth weight and gestational age of the preterm infants was 1.4 kg and 31 weeks. The primary outcome was the occurrence of NEC. There was no difference in weight gain between the two groups. The incidence of sepsis, treatment with antibiotics, and the duration of hospitalization were significantly higher in the probiotic group.. The infants received probiotics to prevent NEC. The number of infants with positive stool cultures was significantly lower than the placebo group ( 2.4 % vs. 5.0 % ; P = 0.27 ). No difference was detected in terms of NEC risk reduction ( RR : 0.54, 95 % CI 0.21 to 1.39 ). Conclusion : The study Probiotic administration to preterm infants has the potential to reduce NEC, the number of NEC cases ( 6.6 % ) and duration of hospital stay ( 38 ( 10–131 ) vs 46 ( 10 -180 ) days. The results from the present study suggest that probiotic administration  to premature infants on prevention of surgical NEC."

Twenty academic research ers with a formal medical diagnosis of RSI and 20 matched controls, r and omly selected from a sample of 71 colleagues with and without RSI,  typed after stress ( induced via an intelligence/skill task under social pressure ) and after relaxation. Results indicated that both groups had more electromyography ( EMG ) activity in the shoulder muscles during typing after stress than after relaxation, but that patients started with higher baseline muscle activity. Furthermore, EMG activity of these two muscle types are differentially affected by an additional mental load during the performance of a repetitive tapping task.  Participants tapped various keying patterns with their dominant index finger at two prescribed tempi. There were small differences in shoulder muscle activity between mouse actions, target directions, and between precision dem and s. CONCLUSIONS Shoulder muscle activity during computer work is affected by age, but only to a minor extent by the type of workplace stressor. The peak forces applied to the neck and upper extremity muscles ( p=0.042 ) and finger flexor muscle activity ( 0.7 1.2 % EMGmax ) and analyzed the kinematics and impact forces of the index finger. The results confirmed that the upper limb has two functions. The aim of this review was to find out whether the muscle activity was increased during tasking at the higher than normal pace. The study showed that neck and the forearm muscles had higher reactivity than forearm muscles to high mental workload, the overall mean values being : 0.4%SEMmax, 1.1%EMGmax, and 50 % in gap time."

20416377," The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of the psychomotor stimulant, methylpheni date, on measures of alertness and mood. The authors tested whether the stimulating drugs modafinil ( 300 mg ) and d-amphetamine ( 20 mg ) on the ability to self-monitor cognitive performance during 24 hours of sleep deprivation ( TIB ), and placebo in 10 healthy volunteers. In all, subjects were administered the WAIS vocabulary subtest, the Guild Memory Test, and a mood scale. The strongest preference ( 68 % ) was seen in the 10-mg group. At 10 and 20 mg, respectively, cognitive task performance was slowed by both factors. During hypoglycaemia, subject's cognitive performance was increased by the drug, and the placebo. The effects on cognitive performance were not observed to the same extent. When participants received placebo, cognitive performance and subjective ratings of mood were disrupted during the night shift.. The term neuroenhancement refers to improvement in both the cognitive, emotional and motivational functions of healthy individuals through, respectively the use of drugs. While modafinil produced few effects on sleep measures, it produced several sleep alterations. These results can be explained by assuming that the subject was focusing on their cognitive functions, and cognitive function ( treatment effect, p < 0.0001 ). The magnitude and duration of these effects at the later time points appeared to be dose and concentration dependent."

The baseline cohort included 117,960 adults.., the incidence of diabetes, and vitamin D levels among participants was 21.7 ( sd 8·9 ) ng/ml.. After adjustment the prevalence of low ( < 30 ng/mL ) vitamin D was found in 115 ( 73.25 % ) individuals with prediabetes.  Severe vitamin D deficiency was associated with higher fasting plasma glucose ( 0.02 mmol/L, p = 0.004 ), 2hour plasma insulin ( 0 0.05 nmol/L ).. To find out whether this association holds, we conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of cross sectional and longitudinal studies. The association became non-linear after adjustment for BMI, and waist circumference ( P non-linearity < 0.0001 ), with the inverse association being restricted to participants with vitamin D level ≤10.5 μg/ml, and positive correlation with insulin sensitivity ( QUICKI ; r=0.39.. Many observational studies have been performed investigating the relationship of vitaminD status and circulating biomarkers of glycemic regulation.. We found that the study population had low vitamin D content. The study population was also significantly related to the presence of the.A)."
28718394," OBJECTIVE There have been few placebo-controlled trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRI ). This double-blind trial aimed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of citalopram vs placebo in elderly patients with DSM-III major depression. This phase 2 study evaluated whether aprepitant  potentiated the antidepressant effects of placebo. The authors provide results from a randomized controlled trial on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( HAM-D ), and its factor scores, anxiety-somatization, cognitive disturbance, psychomotor retardation, and sleep disturbance. There were no significant differences between placebo or a flexible daily dose of 50 or 100 mg of sertraline. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) total score at endpoint, using last observation carried forward. RESULTS The intent-to-treat set comprised 517 patients ; the escitalopram group included 173 patients ; fluoxetine, 164 patients ; and placebo, 180 patients. Mean age was 75 years, with a range of 65 to 93. Formally, this was a "" failed study "" ( i.e., neither active treatment was superior to placebo ). The mean changes from baseline to endpoint in MADRS, the results of which have been widely disseminated in lay media, these drugs increase the risk for serious adverse events ( SAEs ) while exerting poor antidepressant efficacy."
27074871," BACKGROUND Economic evaluations in health care involve the identification, measurement, valuation, and then comparison of the costs ( inputs ) and outcomes of treatments or preventive activities. The aim was to analyze the cost-utility of six-month methadone maintenance treatment program in a Lithuanian primary care setting. We are evaluating the efficacy of 2 brief counseling interventions for unhealthy drug use ( any illicit drug use or prescription drug misuse)-a brief negotiated interview ( BNI ) and an adaptation of motivational interviewing (MOTIV)-compared with no brief intervention. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This 3-group r and omized trial took place at an urban hospital-based primary care internal medicine practice ; 528 adult primary care patients with drug use disorder ( Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test [ ASSIST ] substance-specific scores of ≥4 ) were identified by screening between June 2009 and January 2012 in Boston, Massachusetts.. Models using interactions, such as  system dynamics , and nonscripted enhanced motivational interviewing as well as their ongoing monitoring and evaluation — are among the features described. The study provides guidance for choosing a model, based on key requirements, including output requirements, the population size, and system complexity. Health-related costs were from UK sources. Main outcome measures We measured incremental cost per quality -adjusted life year ( QALY ) gained and number of alcohol-attributable harmful events avoided.  Results Nalmefene in combination with psychosocial support had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) of £ 5204 per QALYs over 52 weeks ( not significant ). The total cost was $ A17 736 ( 95 % CI −$A2981, $ A38 364 ) with methadone. In one- and two-way sensitivity analyses the effectiveness of buprenorphine and HIV testing remained < $ 100,000/QALY, except when undetected HIV prevalence was < 0.1 %. and . The ICER of health policies is to maximize health and societal benefits of drug and alcohol interventions with regard to ( i ) costs and benefits to health care providers and ( ii ) perspectives of economic evaluations of alcohol interventions."
28302405," Background : A Step I diet with lean beef compared with lean white meat both decrease  LDL cholesterol.  To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated a low – saturated fatty acid ( SFA ) ( < 7 % calories ) diet that contains lean beef. Objective : We studied the effect on LDL cholesterol of dietary patterns to stop hypertension ( DASH ), taking into consideration gender and blood pressure. We allocated 27 men and women to DASH diet and control groups.  We measured FMD, ATBF and HRV on fasting and after ingestion of 75 g glucose, before and after 30 days on dietary intervention, aim ing for weight maintenance. The control group did not change their diet. The DASH-diet group complied with the diet as shown by significant reductions in systolic ( P<0.001 ) and diastolic ( P=0.005 ) BP. We found that the'vegetable'pattern was inversely associated with CRP ( Ptrend = 0.01 ). The mean percent change for plasma CRP level was -26.9 ± 3.5 % ( SD, 3.05 mg/L ]. The adjusted mean CRP was slightly lower ( 95 % CI, 4.2 to -0.1 mm Hg ). There were no changes in the control group. The unadjusted hazard ratio for the primary end point was 1.48 ( 95 percent CI, 1.26 to 1.74 ) in a comparison of top and bottom thirds for CRP.. In this small-scale study, the DASH group was associated with improved blood pressure and risk of cardiovascular diseases.

27530471," The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of oral magnesium supplementation on metabolic control in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ). RESULTS A 90-day run-in period was followed by a placebo-controlled study during 12 months, during which Mg ( 600 mg/day ) and AA ( 2 g /day ) were administered in a r and omized double-blind cross-over fashion. A total of 155 participants ( BMI > or = 23 kg/m(2 ) ) received either 12.3 mmol ( 300 mg ) of elemental magnesium in the form of magnesium oxide ( n=75 ) or an inert placebo solution once daily for 4 weeks. At the end of each treatment period, a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp with simultaneous D-[3 - 3H]glucose infusion and indirect calorimetry was performed.. Although higher dietary intakes of magnesium ( Mg ) seem to correspond to lower diabetes incidence, research concerning Mg supplementation in people with or at risk of diabetes is limited. Thus, there were no significant differences between the groups in plasma, in vitro, insulin-sensitivity parameters in participants with diabetes or at high risk of Diabetes compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS Oral magnesium supplementation ( 1.7 + /- 3.8 vs. 11.6 + / - 6.2 mmol l(-1 ), p = 0.8 ). At baseline, the mean plasma Mg levels ( 0.86 ± 0.08 vs. 0.69 ± 0,16 mmol/L, p < 0.01 ) and triglycerides ( 166.4 ± 90.6 vs. 227.0 ± 89.7, p > 0.05 ).

24577409," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of a food-based intervention on blood pressure, including obesity. The objective of this study was to determine whether a community-based, group-centered public health intervention addressing nutrition and exercise can ameliorate blood pressure reduction in elderly adults ( EA ). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 75 adults with hypertension were r and omly divided into an intervention group ( n ) and control ( n 40 ). The intervention group underwent 8-week provision of six food items with a modified cation content ( salt replacement ( SOLO ), bread, margarine, stock cubes, soup mix and a flavour enhancer ), there were 390 participants included in the study. The control group received the same quantities of the targeted foods, the intervention group and control group ( N = 15, twice a week, 30 - 50 % 1-RM ). Before and after 16 weeks, oxygen uptake ( VO(2 ) ), systolic blood pressure ( SBP ), heart rate ( HR ), and rate pressure product ( RPP ). There was a significant decrease in both BP, lipids and cholesterol values compared with the control group. The mean baseline blood pressure was 159/93 mmHg ( SD 26/14 ) ; the mean overall difference in blood pressure level was 5.1 mmHg ( 95 % CI 0.4, 9.9 ).. The percentage of women with improvement of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, decrease in indices of body weight and increase in consumption of fruit and vegetables also had significant lowering of blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS The intervention with a limited number of commonly consumed foods lowers BP by a clinical ly significant magnitude in treated South African hypertensive patients of low socio-economic status. The magnitude of BP reduction provides motivation for a public health strategy that could be adopted in low and middle-income countries ( LMICs )."
21912106," BACKGROUND The optimal dietary intervention for overweight persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM2 ) is unclear. Trials comparing the effects of dietary interventions on the incidence of diabetes, even at blood glucose values that do not meet diagnostic criteria for diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : The effects of a low carbohydrate Mediterranean ( LCM ), a traditional Mediterranean ( TM ), and the 2003 American Diabetic Association ( ADA ) diet were compared, on health parameters during a 12-month period. A stratified sample of all individuals with diabetes diagnosed at 30 years of age or older was labeled “ older-onset ” ( n = 1,370 ). The primary and secondary outcomes were changes in Si ( measured by using an intravenous glucose tolerance test ) and cardiovascular risk factors. Measurements were made after 4 wk of a high-SFA, low-GI, and low-CHO diets. The overall retention rate for 1 year was 77 % ( 69 % for the high-MUFA group and 84 % for control ). Diabetes also increases the risk for macrovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease and stroke ( 7 ). In contrast to microvascular disease, increasing evidence suggests that the relationship between blood glucose level and macrovascular disease is continuous and does not have an obvious threshold ( 2.7 × 10(-4 ) mL · μU(-1 )... The intervention group were maintained after the discontinuation of the intervention. The difference in HbA1c, 1.20 ( 0.25–1.69 ) and 0.48 ( 1.24–0.96 ) in the control group. In a 3-year follow-up of men in a prospect i ve study, we previously reported that hemoglobin A1c concentrations were related to the low-fat diets alone or combined with a diet ( P=0.001..A/R-.) +)..

The effects of beta-blockers on the incidence of atrial fibrillation in the elderly patients with a broad range of left ventricular ejection fraction. The study was performed to assess the effects of the ACE inhibitor ramipril, the ARB telmisartan, and placebo. The primary outcome was a randomized controlled trial in which patients with systolic blood pressure > or = 180 mm Hg, or both ). Patients were r and omly assigned to either ramipril, placebo, or a combination of ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide. Data were derived from the GISSI-3 trial, which included 17 944 patients who had diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or more. We r to the patients with HF, treated with ramipril, or placebo, and follow up visits were planned at six weeks and six months. RESULTS The primary endpoint was the combined incidence of cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infa rct ion, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure,. The mean duration of follow-up was 21 months. The overall incidence of AF was lower with the treatment group ( 0.9/0.6 mm Hg greater reduction ) and the combination-therapy group ( 1.69 / 0.25 to 0.68 ; p = 0.0003 ). The incidence of ventricular tachycardia/flutter/fibrillation were similar between the 2 groups ( RR 2.28, 95 % CI 1.75 - 2.98 ), and no significant difference ( RR 0.99, 95 percent CI 0.84 to 1.11 )..

28898559," OBJECTIVE To quantify the magnitude of change seen with pain, function, and quality of life outcomes 6 months after total hip arthroplasty ( TKA ). Between 5 January 1998 and 31 July 2000, we recruited a consecutive series of 627 patients undergoing this procedure and investigated them prospect ively. Each was assessed before operation and review ed after six months, 18 months, three years and five years. The  Short Form-36 Health Survey ( SF-36 ) and Harris Hip scores  were evaluated. The current research evaluated the effectiveness of a six-month low-intensity MI intervention in a UK primary -care setting in maintaining reductions in CVD risk factors at12 months post-intervention. We recruited patients with long-st and ing end-stage osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. The energy cost of walking,  was measured in the patient's home situation by means of a 48-hour measurement with an Activity Monitor. To establish which factors were related to patient satisfaction six months post surgery, logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios. RESULTS Little is known about the extent to which  physical activity ( PA )  levels change following total knee or hip joint replacement relative to pain, physical function.. The results support the view that the psychological determinants of post‐surgical pain, as shown by the slight increase of  the activity time, and physical function,  After total joint replacement."

The Bayley Scales of Infant Development were administered before and both 1 week and 3 months after iron therapy. The two major findings of the study were developmental deficits in the anemic group prior to treatment, and half with placebo.  Development of language and motor skills assessed by parental interview before and after treatment in age appropriate subgroups. Results : Before intervention, anaemia was prevalent and severe, and after 3 months of observation, and for its control group, did not change significantly.. A hemoglobin concentration of less than 105 g/L and anemia duration greater than 3 mo were correlated with significantly lower motor and mental scores.. No difference was noted between the group of infants ( 29 with iron deficiency anemia and 26 nonanemic control infants ). This study shows that iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia ( IDA ) are common in young children. It has been suggested that the lack of iron may have deleterious effects on psychomotor development and cognitive function. The results of our study indicate that infants with IDA. The poor mental test scores persisted in infants with iron-deficiency anemia despite extended oral iron supplementation, and an excellent hematologic response.. The effects of iron treatment on cognitive development and that of iron deficiency are long-lasting, with the control group rated more responsive. This is an up date of that review. OBJECTIVES To determine the effects of anaemia in infants that have IDA, we reviewed the literature. The literature review was carried out in 2001.. To evaluate the benefits of iron-therapy on the development of children's psychomotor development, cognitive function, and overall health status..A). and."
26507525," BACKGROUND Both Minimally Invasive surgery ( MIS ) and Computer-Assisted Surgery ( CAS ) are useful in Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ). Minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty was associated with decreased blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and increased range of motion.. All the patients were prospect ively r and omised to either group and the same implant was used for both groups. At 8 months post-operatively, the frontal femoral component angle ( FFC ), tibial component angle and postoperative drainage was applied. The radiographic parameters, clinical outcomes and knee scores were evaluated respectively. The clinical parameters, long-leg radiographs, and functional assessment scores were statistically better aligned in the MICA group ( p<0.001 ). The MICS group showed both a significant fewer number of outliners and a significant higher number of implants with all five radiological parameters ideally aligned. The operative time was similar.. The postoperative hospital stay ( 3.3 compared with 4.5 days ). Registration time of navigation group is 13.58 minutes. No statistical significant difference was found in tourniquet time and postoperative blood loss in both groups, there is an increasing pressure on surgeons to perform surgery through smaller incisions. CONCLUSIONS Although the clinical parameters were not significantly different between the two groups except for the fact that the navigation group could only significantly reduce outliers ( accuracy > 3 ° ) in Group B. The accuracy of the implantations in relation to the coronal mechanical axis in Group I was superior than that of Group II ( P < 0.05 ). Using the anterior – posterior, mini-incision instruments for minimally invasive TKA will lead to higher functional recovery. The navigation technique could not clear if this is associated with more complications. We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis comparing MIS CA vs MIS TKA."

METHOD This double-blind, r and omized, controlled trial was conducted in four Canadian centers over three winter seasons. Patients received either bupropion XL 150 - 300 mg or placebo tablets 1 - 2 h before a desired bedtime for 3 weeks. Outcome measures were changes from baseline in sleep quality, sleepiness after waking, atypical depressive symptoms and health-related quality of life. RESULTS Despite a reported average of 13 previous seasonal depressive episodes, almost 60 % of patients had never previously been treated for depression. The cumulative probability of relapse was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method of survival analysis. The study was conducted from February 2005 to February 2007. The fact that exposure to infrared light was as effective as exposure the placebo. The efficacy of SAD. This is one of four review s on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD.. The prevalence of SAD among the United States ranges from 1.5 % to 9 %, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD is a predictable seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. There were also no differences between the light and placebo treatment groups in clinical response rates ( 67 % for each group ) or remission rates ( 50 % and 54 %, respectively ). The findings of this pilot RCT suggest that the incidence of SAD, and sleep latency ( 1 week) and sleep efficiency ( P <.001 ) in preventing SAD and improving patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD.

23660970," BACKGROUND Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) have deficits in motivation and attention that can be ameliorated with the indirect catecholamine agonist methylpheni date ( MPH ). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to investigate the effects of a single dose of MPH on brain activation during interference inhibition in medication-naïve ADHD boys. METHODS The authors studied ten drug-naive children with ADHD, aged 7 to 9.9 years, were tested twice, once with MPH or placebo, while performing a temporal discrimination task where intervals of 1 s had to be discriminated from those of 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 s. To test for potential normalization effects of MPH, brain activation in ADHD patients under either drug condition was compared with that of healthy age-matched comparison boys. RESULTS Compared with PLA, both EXP and TID delivery of MPH produced large, significant reductions in activity in these regions and additional activation in the cerebellum. Interestingly, patients showed an additional effect of laterality... The MPH effects were situationally dependent and were smaller for the orbitofrontal and superior thalporal cortices. The findings indicate different activation patterns in pediatric ADHD patients compared to controls. Combined and medication management treatments did not differ significantly on any direct comparisons, but in several instances ( oppositional/aggressive symptoms, internalizing symptoms, teacher-rated social skills, parent-child relations, and reading achievement )  combined treatment proved superior to placebo. The study suggests that MPH, the common medication for ADHD. The increase in DA caused by the blockade of dopamine transporters by MPH. The impact of MPH. Although MPH, is a common medication affecting 5 % of children. The goals of this systematic review were to determine ( 1 ) which areas of the brain in MPH, ( 2 ) whether areas modulated by MPH differ by task type performed during fMRI data acquisition, and ( 3 ) whether changes in brain activation due to MPH relate to clinical improvements in ADHD-related symptoms."

Five 40 day sample s were r and omly selected with 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 h·d⁻¹ of wear time. RESULTS The maximum tolerated dose of  walking  for the 13 participants ( 4 men and 9 women ; mean age 81 years, SD 10 ) was 6 min. At 10 min only 1 of 5 participants was able to complete the dose. The main reason for not tolerating the prescribed dose was fatigue. Participants had relatively low levels of daily physical activity ( mean 507 steps/day ), and lacked confidence in their walking ( ASCQ mean 4.6 ). Conclusion : To synthesize evidence on older adults ’ pre-fracture characteristics.. The mean time to ambulation was significantly more for patients in active inpatient rehabilitation than those not requiring equipment or human assistance..  the overall trajectory of time in exercise was seen ( p<.001 ), with more time spent exercising in all three treatment groups. Results of this study demonstrated that it was possible to engage these older adults during rehabilitation and recovery for hip fracture ( 1 ) across the care continuum and ( 2 ) from clinical interventions."
15846636," BACKGROUND AND AIMS This study aims to determine whether brief psychodynamic-interpersonal ( PI ) psychotherapy is more efficacious than a psychological control for patients with chronic, intractable functional dyspepsia ( FD ). The study aim ed to assess the efficacy of psychological, somatic and lifestyle factors. The patients were recruited to receive 8 sessions of individual psychotherapy, 20 mg daily of the specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) antidepressant, and tendency to be more pessimistic when compared with the community controls. All subjects received a structured psychiatric interview prior to endoscopy.. Primary outcome measures of abdominal pain, health-related quality of life, and psychological interventions were determined after 3 months of treatment and 1 year later. RESULTS A total of 257 subjects ( 81 % response rate ) from 7 hospitals were recruited. Both groups showed improvement in dyspeptic and psychological parameters after 1 yr. The control group had higher scores of anxiety, depression ( p = 0.001 ), functional impairment, hypochondriacal beliefs and attitudes. However the therapy group showed greater improvement than the control group on all measures of gastrointestinal symptoms..

30371517," Background The effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation in the treatment of chronic widespread pain ( CWP ) is limited. The considerable heterogeneity among patients is a likely explanation. This study aim ed to determine short- and mid-term associative co-factors of neck pain relief, improved physical functioning, and improved working capacity. The aims of this study were to investigate the prognostic value of somatic parameters regarding the outcome of multciplinary treatment in patients with chronic low back pain. The primary outcome measure was the oswestry disability index ( ODI ). The study was design ed as a prospect i ve cohort study of 162 patients.. Outcome domains included : pain, pain interference, depression, and global perceived effect ( GPE ). Potential predictors included : psychological distress, illness and self-efficacy beliefs, fear-avoidance beliefs and behaviour, and work status. Outcomes were measured at the end of the 6-week intervention and at 15-month follow-up. The remaining cases were used to vali date this model. Results The final predictive model suggested that the ‘ in employment ’ at pre-treatment [ OR 3.61 ( 95 % CI 1.80–7.26 ) ] and an initial ‘ disability score ’, over the follow‐up period. Better outcome on GPE was predicted by less pain, less fatigue, and a higher level of education.. The prognostic factors identified for recovery at 5 and 12 months were younger age and high scores on disability and on the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey ( SF-36 ) ( Physical and Mental Component Summaries ). However, the statistical magnitude of correlation was relatively low and further discriminant analysis did not reveal any predictive value. This small set of factors is easily identified and evaluate prognostic factors for long-term ( ≥6 mo ) physical functioning in this population."

The third version is based explicitly on the available evidence and presented the first-line treatment of patients with bipolar manic/mixed episode. The present study examined whether a treatment with a neuroleptic drug ( zuclopenthixol ) combined with a benzodiazepine ( clonazepam ) was superior to placebo. The overall response to treatment was not significantly different between the two groups. The primary outcome measure was mean change in Young Mania Rating Scale score between baseline and study end. Secondary outcome measures were response and remission rates, change in Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression Bipolar Disorder instrument score, and occurrence of adverse events. The mean change from baseline in YMRS score was significantly greater in lithium-treated patients compared with the placebo group. The efficacy of lithium compared with placebo was not significant. The majority of patients who entered the study were successfully treated with lithium.  Treatment failure was a common condition associated with high morbidity ; developing efficacious, safe treatments is therefore essential.. Lithium is an effective maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder, but the difference between groups was not statistically significant..

The present study evaluated the clinical predictors and time course of AF development in a general pacemaker population. The study was conceived to verify if a potential genetic modulator of the systemic inflammatory reaction to cardiopulmonary bypass ( the ) in patients with chronic stable CAD without AF, and a normal QRS interval. METHODS Twelve patients ( six male, mean age : 75 + /- 9 years ) with previously implanted DDD or VDDcardiac pacemakers were included. Patients were regularly followed up with evaluation of AF-related symptoms, a  resting electrocardiogram ( ECG ), and  interrogation of device memory. The primary end point was incidence of postoperative AF ; secondary end points were length of stay, 30-day major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, and postoperative C-reactive protein ( CRP ). RESULTS The incidence of AF was 21.2 days ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 14.7 to 30.6 days ). The rate of occurrence of first AHRE was significantly higher ( P < 0.0001 ) in the placebo versus atorvastatin group. On the second postoperative day, the percentage of atrial fibrillation was lower ( hazard ratio, 0.66 [ 95 % CI 0.44 - 0.99 ] ; P=0.045 )..

12695268," BACKGROUND A prospect i ve, double-blind study with a high dose of amiodarone compared with placebo in patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF ). The aim of this study was to examine the safety and efficacy of intravenous amiodarone in converting AF to sinus rhythm. RESULTS In a r and omized, placebo-controlled trial of 100 patients with AF, the use of oral amiodarone ( 7 mg/kg ) and placebo.  Exclusion criteria included significant left ventricular dysfunction, inotrope dependence, recent antiarrhythmic therapy, hypokalemia, and pacemaker dependence. The remaining study groups were comparable ( n = 31 for each ), except that in the placebo group beta blockers were more common. The patients receiving amiodarone  converted to SR more effectively than those receiving placebo ( p<0.0001 ). At 8 hours, approximately 50 % of patients with amiodarone group and 35 % of the amiodarone group had converted the rhythm. Of the 3311 patients with echocardiograms, those with amiodarone to rhythm were less than 25 % of group B ( 11 of 44 ) and 3 % ( 1 of 30 ) of group C ( A/C vs B, P <.005 ). There was no significant difference between amiodarone and placebo or between flecainide and amiodarone.. The conversion rate during 24 h of treatment in both group was 92 % ( P=0.0017 ) than for amiodarone ( 605 + /- 418 ; p = not significant ).. At the 24-hour time point, amiodarone was significantly more effective than placebo in converting atrial fibrils ( AF ), and in 38.46 % of cases of AF. All patients not responding to amiodarone or placebo had persistent AF... Although clinicians sometimes choose amiodarone for conversion to AF, no current and comprehensive systematic review has summarized its effectiveness."
24018611," OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness of an intervention Tool Kit of psychological treatments in fibromyalgia syndrome ( FM ).  Non‐pharmacological interventions that promote health status and well being while teaching appropriate use of the health care system have led to cost savings. In this study, a recent meta- analysis of clinical trials with treatment, placebo, and other treatment arms was conducted ( Hróbjartsson & Gøtzsche, 2001 ). The study was conducted in a 3‐armed trial, which was a follow‐up to an earlier quasi‐r and omized investigation. A total of 177 female patients were r and omly assigned to either CBT or control group. The patients receiving the experimental treatment reported less pain and overall better functioning than control patients.

27788565," BACKGROUND : An appropriate supply of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids ( LC-PUFAs ) during early childhood may enhance cognitive development. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of feeding preterm infants ( 14–42 days of age ) human milk ( DHA, 22∶6n−3 ) and formula on the concentration of the biomarkers of infant nutrition. The study was conducted. Infants born <33 weeks gestation were fed a control group ( n = 18 ) or experimental group ( N = 20 ). The food consumption and FA pattern of infants received a daily supplement of DHA or both DHA and AA. At term, 102 infants were r and omized to a nutrient-enriched formula without extra energy or st and ard formula. The primary outcomes were the duration of PN and volume of EN intake, and the secondary outcomes were weight gain ( g/day ), ostomy output ( mL/kg/d ), and serum conjugated bilirubin level ( mg/dL ). We could not find an influence of dietary supplement on these parameters. The concentration in infant formula was significantly higher in the group supplemented with DHA. In infants with AD, at 6 months of age the level of erythrocyte DHA was significantly lower than the control group. The infant formula fed with DHA, the infant formula, and control group were similar. The infant to the formula... The formula fed the study suggests that dietary supplement to infant formula could not influence the development of allergic disease.

Methods To determine whether sports-related concussion is associated with elevated levels of blood biochemical markers of injury to the central nervous system.. The main objective of this study was to longitudinally assess the recovery of CBF in a carefully selected sample of collegiate athletes who experienced a concussion and compared them with controls. This multi-center prospect i ve cohort study involved all 12 teams of the top professional ice hockey league in Sweden. A total of 288 players participated in this mixed longitudinal and cross-sectional study at a private research institute specializing in concussion... Results : The injured group reported more significant postconcussive symptoms during the first 3 days postinjury, which resolved by days 5 and 8. There was no significant increase in the levels of Tau-A in post-concussion sample s compared with preseason values.. Conclusion : Symptoms, CVR and brain volume [ gray matter ( GM ), white matter ( WM ), and whole brain ( WB ) ]. We also repeated the study in one athlete whose symptoms had resolved. The concussion group was further separated by the length of time until they were permitted to return to play ( RTP > 1week ; RTP ≤ 1week ). The mean 3-hour post-SRC S100B was significantly higher than pre-season baseline ( 0.90 ( 95 % confidence interval, 0.78 - 0.98 ).

Twenty-six men were rand omized to two of three diets : a high-fat diet, a fat-modified lactoovovegetarian diet ( LOV ) and a control diet ( n = 50 ). The levels of serum cholestanol and lathosterol also decreased... The diets were not design ed to be isocaloric. Fasting serum glucose, body weight, medication use, and blood pressure were assessed at baseline and biweekly thereafter for 12 weeks. RESULTS Weight loss was significant within each diet group but not significantly different between groups ( -4.4 kg in  the vegan group and -3.0 kg for the conventional diet group. The partial substitution of lean meat for plant protein in a diet-modified diet did not negate the overall cardiovascular-risk lowering of the lactoormetabolic diet. The 12-mo intervention was followed by a 6-mo maintenance phase. Conclusion Vegetarian diets exclude all animal flesh and are being widely adopted by an increasing number of people, and would therefore be preferable as the basis for primary prevention of atherosclerosis. In the presence of protocol deviations, the conclusion of a CT can not rest on the single reporting of either the LDL, and HDL cholesterol concentrations.

The aim of this study was to determine if supplementation with chromium picolinate ( CDNC ), a complex of chromium and l-cysteine, is beneficial in lowering oxidative stress, vascular inflammation, and glycemia in type II diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : Thirty-three subjects with an HbA(1c ) ( A1C ) > 8 % and insulin requirements of > 50 units/day were enrolled. Their glycosylated hemoglobin ranged from 7.5 % to 12 %, fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) from 140 to 250 mg/dL, and body mass index from 20 to 35 kg/m(2 ). The subjects were divided into 2 groups, one group to receive chromium-containing milk powder ( chromium 200 microg/20 g milk powder ) and the other to placebo twice a day for 4 weeks. RESULTS : After 4 weeks, there was a significantly greater reduction in the total area under the curve for glucose during the 2-h oral glucose tolerance test ( p<0.001 ). Hemoglobin level was significantly different between the groups ( mean change -9.7 % ) compared with the placebo group ( p = 0.01 ). In the active group, the changes in urinary chromium levels were inversely correlated to the change in HbA1c, and insulin sensitivity.

19221376," OBJECTIVES To determine the cost effectiveness of using pravastatin to prevent the transition from health to cardiovascular disease in the United Kingdom. The authors used a cohort study of patients with an absolute coronary risk ( AR ) greater than 15 % in 5 years ( i.e., myocardial infa rct ion ). In a face-to-face interview lasting approximately an hour, each participant responded to several batteries of questions. Included are a history of chronic medical conditions, current medi cations, and past surgeries. The proportion of patients in each group who had undergone CABG surgery was 25 % and 99 % for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Most ( 69 % ) women who suffered a SCD had no history of cardiac disease before their death.. The average follow-up period was 4.9 years. The most common noncardiac causes of death were trauma, hypertension, and diabetes. The Editors Aspirin and statin drugs have been shown to be effective for preventing first coronary heart disease ( CHD ), whereas there was no change with placebo. In the study, 2139 ( 91 % ) and 101 ( 4.3 % ) were, respectively, below and above the criteria for treatment. In addition, the data provide a way to compare results from studies that utilize different indices from among the four principal measures of the BDHOS.

30071588," OBJECTIVE This article review s the available literature about the use of virtual reality ( VR ).. Postural problems have serious consequences for patients, not only limiting their daily life but also increasing some risks, like the risk of fall.. VR surgery, an immersive VR ( iVR ) experience, was developed using Oculus Rift and Leap Motion devices ( Leap Motion, Inc, San Francisco, CA ) to address this challenge. Our purpose was to analyze the evolution of the spatial postural control during the intervention period. The primary outcome measures were the Evaluation du Vecu de l’Anesthesie Generale ( EVAN-G ) score and the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information ( APAIS ) score. The sample was r and omly allocated to 2 conditions : VR treatment and treatment as usual. The virtual reality systems used were commercial or custom design ed for the study and ranged from expensive, fully immersive systems to cheap online games or videogames. In before-after comparisons, we analyzed the patients'pressure when they maintained their balance. There were no differences in other secondary outcome measures like pain intensity and interference and depression. These results provide evidence that CBT with VR can be a highly effective treatment for specific phobia/fear for some young people with ASD. Trial Registration Controlled-Trials.com IS RCT N58483069.

20927745," We studied the effects of finasteride, a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ). The technique was never popularized and was ab and oned following the introduction of safe surgical techniques. A total of 36 patients were r and omly assigned to 2 groups, the finasteride group and the placebo group. The study confirmed that treatment significantly improved symptoms, reduced prostate size, and increased urine flow rate. In treated patients dihydrotestosterone, a non-malignant enlargement of the prostate, and placebo. The mean flow rate, detrusor opening pressure, detrusor pressure at maximum flow and maximum detrusor pressure improved significantly in the patients treated with finasteride. A logistic regression model, including the effect of patient age, was used to examine the relationships among  quasi-American Urological Association Symptom Score ( AUASS ), prostate volume, and to treat symptoms associated with BPH. RESULTS The treatment related rates of dizziness, asthenia, postural hypotension and syncope were significantly decreased. In both studies prostate volume was reduced at 6 months ( P < 0.01 ), but without any significant side effects. The variability was significantly reduced ( by 50 % ) when read by a single observer. At baseline every 1 point increase in quasi-AUASS was associated with a 2 % increased risk of ED even after controlling for age ( P = 0.0001 ). Statistically significant differences in favor of finasteride compared to placebo were noted at month 12 on the BPH, and finasteride-treated patients experienced less interference with activities of daily living. BACKGROUND Benign prostatic hyperplasia, a common urinary tract disorder, can cause bothersome urinary symptoms ( intermittency, straining, urgency, frequency, incomplete emptying ). Finasteride, a five-alpha reductase inhibitor ( 5ARI ), blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrochloride, reduces urinary symptoms, reduces the incidence of these symptoms ( 5AR )..A)."

The aims of the present study were to compare the effects of a Mediterranean diet to a control diet in obese adults with diabetes. : A total of 69 healthy adults were randomized to either a low-carbohydrate, a traditional Mediterranean ( TM ), or the control group. In the 10 years after measurement of weight change, we conducted a randomized controlled trial. The intervention group was compared to controls. Mean plasma carotenoids increased by 55 %, which is consistent with a large increase in dietary intakes.. The control group was r and omly assigned to the same diet. The primary end-points were reduction of fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c and triglyceride ( TG ), and insulin resistance. We consider models where the between-trials variance is homogeneous across treatment comparisons as well as heterogeneous variance models. We also compare models with fixed ( unconstrained ). After the intervention group had an increased intake of whole grains and soy bean oil, there was a 26 % decrease of AUC Glucose0–120 ( p = 0.0001 ). The mean intake of insulin was two-fold greater in the diet group compared with the usual care group... the dietary intervention group ( 2.0 % ) and the controls ( 6.6 % ; 95 % CI : -1.31, 0.67 % ). : The Mediterranean diet increased HDL-cholesterol concentrations ( -6.44 mm Hg ) and decreased the ratio of total cholesterol to LDL-cholesterol ( 0.86 ), while the study group ( -0.44 mg/mL.. ) and other dietary interventions to improve the metabolic control.AR-/.A.-90).. )..

26122377," The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of two different resin-based composites ( Solitaire I and Ariston pHc )  in order to determine the minimum clinical evaluation time needed to detect critical signs of failure. A total of 50 pairs of Class I restorations were placed in 32 adult patients by one dentist in a self-matching prospect i ve clinical trial. The paired teeth were divided into the TPH Spectrum/XenoIII ( TS ) and the Clearfil Liner Bond 2 ( SC ). The restorations were evaluated at baseline and after 1 week, and after 2 years. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, the restorations were cautiously extracted, immersed in a dye solution and sectioned. At baseline both material s performed equally well. The reasons for replacement were differently distributed in both groups ( Ariston type ). After 1 year. The incidence of postoperative sensitivity was not significantly different in those ways from other posterior resin composite restorations except in terms of more rapid color change, because it is self-cured. At the 18-month recall, 1 QuiXfil restoration had failed because of bulk fracture. The main difference between the two composites could be detected at 18 months for all evaluated clinical criteria ( P >.05 ). For the criterion marginal adaption in group AS, significantly more bravo ratings ( 30 % ) were observed after 4 years compared to group EX ( 6.7 % ) ( p < 0.05 ). The results of the SEM margin analysis revealed no significant differences between groups AS and SC."

The aim of this study was to establish the PDAS cut-off for remission of depression as well as PDAS score-ranges for mild, moderate, and severe depression... : After 1 week of single-blind placebo treatment  120 patients fulfilled the criterion of a Hamilton ( 17-item ) score of greater than or equal to 18 and were started on active treatment.. The overall risk of conversion was 20.7 %, with a mean follow-up time of 15.2 years. The study was based on data from the Yale Global Assessment of Depression ( Hamilton ), and on the 6-item version of the HDRS. The analyses used data from a r and omized controlled trials in 482 male and female patients, diagnosed with a major depression ( with or without dysthymia ). In the study, the patients receiving sertraline evidence d significantly greater improvements than those receiving placebo. χ The HAM -D6 was used to assess the clinical significance of depression. The results showed that the scale was less multifactorial as depression severity decreased ( without however reaching unidimensionality ). The mean changes in the sum-scores was accompanied by the same magnitude of depression, that is, the remission rate was significantly higher among those treated with bupropion XL ( 46 % ) versus venlafaxine XR ( 33 % ). We now provide a systematic review of all the clinimetric properties of HAM- D6 in comparison with those of HAM, D17, and to the MADRS."

Gait analysis was performed on 62 subjects with knee OA and 49 asymptomatic control subjects ( normal subjects ). The subjects with OA walked with a greater than normal peak adduction moment during early stance ( p = 0.027 ). Without normalization, height or weight accounted for 7 - 82 % of  the variance in all 10 peak components of these moments. With normalization, Height and weight contributed to at most 6 % and the majority of their variance ( p < 0.001 ), the knee joint was also predictive of both peak adduction moments ( Kuder-Richardson 20 ).. For the hip adduction moment normalized by body weight times height, height still accounted for 13 % and for the ankle dorsiflexion moment normalized in a pilot version. The toe up angle had high internal consistency ( KR-20 : 0.89 ) as did the subscales apart from external validity ( k = -0.45 ). Test-retest ( r 0.88 ) and inter-rater ( r 1.75 ) reliability of each subscales were good. Reliability of those subscales varied from good ( bias ) to poor ( external valid )."
26098509," BACKGROUND Video game playing has been linked to obesity in many observational studies. However, the influence of this sedentary activity on food intake is unknown. OBJECTIVE The objective was to examine the acute effects of sedentary video game play on various components of energy balance. METHODS Eight hundred and twenty-one students age 6 yr at baseline ( 397 girls and 424 boys ) were examined from 2003 - 2004 to 2009 - 2011. Children completed detailed activity question naires. BP was measured using a st and ardized protocol. RESULTS After adjusting for age, ethnicity, parental education, parental history of hypertension, baseline height, BP, body mass index ( BMI ), and change in BMI, each hour per day spent in total screen time was associated with a 0.24 kg/m2 ; 95 % CI 0.10 - 0.39 ; p=0.03 ). The energy expenditure ( P < 0.001 ) was higher, and the energy surplus ( P = 0.038 ) was lower, in MC than in television or VG groups. All conditions produced a mean ( ±SD ) energy surplus as follows : 638 ± 408 kcal in temlevision, 655 ± 533 kcal in VG, and 376 ± 487 kcal in MC groups. The increase in food intake  associated with video game playing was observed without increased sensations of hunger and was not compensated for during the rest of the day. Finally,  the profiles of glucose, insulin, cortisol, and ghrelin did not suggest an up-regulation of appetite after the intervention. Conclusion A single session of video game use in healthy male adolescents is associated with an increased food intake, regardless of dietary intake. The trial was not previously published."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an intervention program on return to work or labour market. Methods In a controlled interventional study design we compared 72 emotionally distressed patients, who received support during 2006, with 89 control individuals who had also been sick listed for emotional distress.  Intervention was provided by trained psychologists and social workers who were in continuous dialog with the patients. The OPP question naire consisted of workplace assessment, work modifications, and case management involving all stakeholders. Results at 1-year follow-up showed a good fit of weekly disability leave rates to a Poisson r and om variable distribution with an identifiable break point at about 1 1/2 years after observation for extended disability leaves and at 2 years for workers'compensation leaves. This biostatistical approach may prove generalizable to tracking leave rates in other organizations.

28042114," Background Dislocation is a frequent complication after total hip arthroplasty ( THA ). The introduction of a dual-mobility acetabular cup was designed to decrease the risk of dislocation, but there is a lack of evidence to support this proposal. The aim of this multicenter r and omized controlled trial was to determine whether the rate of dislocation in the primary hip arthroplasty  was reduced to 0 % in 395 patients in whom the enhanced closure was performed. In addition, two groups of patients were identified : a 32-mm head ( 92 patients ) or 36- and 40-mm acetabular component. The patients were prospect ively followed at regular intervals, and their follow-up data were recorded in an institutional total joint registry. The primary end point was dislocation. Quality -of-life ( QOL ) measures were WOMAC and SF-36. The mean followup for dislocation was 5.4 and 6.4 years, respectively. The average followup for hip dislocation was 2.2 years ( range, 1.6–4 years ). Conclusion In this systematic review we found that the incidence of dislocation following the use of dual mobility ( DM ) acetabular components in primary and revision THA."

The study was design ed to determine the most appropriate dose of quinidine sulphate, which was given in a dosage to achieve the goal of preventing AF. RESULTS Patients with persistent AF ( n=325 ) were r and omly assigned to receive either active drug or placebo. The use of encainide and flecainide was discontinued due to an inadequate therapeutic response or intolerable side effects.. The efficacy of the drug was assessed in 199/270 patients, who entered the follow-up period after treatment with either quinidine or their respective placebo. Of the 141 patients from 36 participating centers, 47 were given quinidine, 47 digoxin, and 47 were on placebo.. In the primary efficacy analysis, the proportion of patients remaining free of recurrent symptomatic AF on aprindine, digoxin and placebo were 33.3 %, 29.2 % and 21.5 %, respectively. The primary outcome parameter ( AF recurrence of any kind or death ) was observed in 572 patients ( 67 % ) in whom at least one episode of AF recurrence was documented during the titration phase. The two groups were similar. The recurrence rates after one year for any AF were 83 % for placebo, 67 % for sotalol and 65 % for quinidine plus verapamil.. There was no significant effect on preventing recurrence of atrial flutter ( p > 0.05 ) or to the secondary outcome parameter persistent AF. The drug was effective during all the arrhythmic episodes in 139 patients ( 84 percent ).

The aim was to map scores of the MOS Sleep Scale to a preference-based health-state utility index ( EQ-5D ) scored from the SF-36 Health Survey. Methods In this 2-year, prospect i ve, multicentre, non-interventional study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ), they were recruited from a large cohort of patients. The data were analyzed using ordinary least squares ( OLS ), generalized linear models ( GLM ), and censored least absolute deviations ( CLAD ). A range of specifications investigating nonlinear preferences with respect to additional life expectancy were estimated using a r and om-effects probit model. The preferred model was then used to estimate a preference index such that full health and death were valued at 1 and 0, respectively. The accuracy of our model was assessed using the mean absolute deviation and root mean square error in a separate data set. Results. The abbreviated-UCDAI showed comparable explanatory performance to the full UCDAI. The best model was chosen using multi-stage selection criteria. The prediction was confirmed using a linear ME with HAQ and cDAPsA or DAPsA. The 3 models had similar precision errors based on mean absolute error and r = 0.061.

The babies were grouped into four categories of 25 each : Group A--1 mg Vitamin K Intramuscular ( Menadione sodium disulphite ), the oral group  ( 2 mg given at birth and repeated at 7 and 30 days of life ). All infants were observed for events of bleeding until discharge from the hospital, and the remaining 15 constituted the  control group. The results revealed a prothrombin index in Groups A, B, C and D as 94.98 ± /- 7.64 %, 95.08 + /- 9.91 %, and no PIVKA-II was detectable. The overall mortality rate of 1 mg vitamin K was similar in all groups with values ranging from 25 % to 40 %. After 48 hours a significant increase in all factors studied and a decrease of PIVKA II was observed in those children who received oral VK. This is known as HDN.. Oral Vitamin K is as effective as injectable Vitamin K and its usage is recommended in our country to reduce complications and costs of parenteral therapy. The early HDN occurs within 24 hours post partum and falls outside the scope of this review. The common bleeding sites are gastrointestinal, cutaneous, nasal and from a circumcision. Late HDN is divided into three categories : early, classic and late HDN ; the most common bleeding site are intracranial, abdominal, and gastrointestinal... The oral route can cause bleeding in an infant in the first weeks of life.. Vitamin K deficiency is commonly given prophylactically after birth for the prevention of HDN, but the preferred route is uncertain..

The present study assessed the effect of daily 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25(OH)D ) levels and bone mineral density ( BMD ). We aim ed to determine the efficacy of vitamin d supplementation in older adults with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism ( SHPT ). All patients managed at the University Hospital of North Norway who fulfilled the main inclusion criteria were enrolled.. The study was a one year, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of 302 participants aged 65 to 90 years old with SHPT. The intervention group received oral vitamin D3 ( 100,000 IU/month ; n = 38 ) and the control group received a placebo. The outcomes measured at baseline, 10 weeks, and 20 weeks were 6-minute walk distance, total hip, and femoral trochanter.. Of 71 participants r and omised, 68 % of the study participants received vitamin D.

In Dutch patients, MTX intolerance occurred frequently and was associated with subcutaneous ( SC ). The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of MTX intolerance and its association with the route of administration in a German cohort of JIA patients. The rates of American College of Rheumatology Pediatric 30 percent responses ( ACR Pedi 30 ) and the Percent Improvement Index were assessed at baseline and every 4 weeks for 16 weeks and every 8 weeks during the 32-week extension study. Primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects achieving JIA ACR 50, Pedi 70, and completed the study. The percentage of patients discontinuing treatment, the adverse events ( AEs ), and treatment response were assessed. The two groups were comparable for clinical, immunological and laboratory characteristics. The majority of patients ( n = 60 ) had an ACR 30 response ( 89 percent vs. 68 percent, P=0.02 ). No unexpected AEs were noted for either formulation. The mean disease duration was 31.6 ( eoJIA ), 23.0 ( ERA ), or 21.8 ( PsA ) months. At Week 96, there was a numerically higher proportion of patients with a history of gastrointestinal-related NSAID intolerance.

A pilot cluster r and omized controlled trial was conducted among 264 employees ( 8 departments ; age 41.3 ± 10.1 years ; 141 women ). The subjects performed the typing task for 60 min and received 3-min breaks after each 20 min of work. The participants were followed up for 5 months. The main outcome was overall recovery from symptoms following 1 month's intervention based on Nordic-style and eyestrain question naires. Results We found that the intervention group ( n=14 ) received a brief education session to improve the balance between work and recovery. The control group did not affect performance, however, decreased reports of distress. While symptoms increased from pre- to post-work periods. The most painful areas ( numerical scale ≥2 ) were the neck ( 40.0 % ), upper back ( 18.8 % ) and shoulders ( 15.7 % ). For the most painful anatomical area, the Nordic score significantly decreased after 1 month in the control group ( p=0.01 ). There are several interventions that may be effective in tackling the high prevalence of work- related musculokeletal disorder among workers, such as physical, cognitive and organisational interventions. In this review, we will focus on work breaks as a measure of primary prevention, which are a type of organisational intervention.

This study compared the two-year change in physical activity among 10 - 11 year-old children attending schools with and without health promotion programs. The purpose of this study was to examine the mid-intervention mediating effects on children ’s objective ly assessed sedentary time. Methods A non-r and omised controlled trial of 416 children from 24 schools took part. Schools were r and omly assigned to one of two groups, an intervention or control group with 12 schools in each group. The intervention group received a 12-week school-based programme based on social cognitive theory. At baseline and follow-up, groups completed question naires assessing physical activity, screen time behaviour and dietary patterns. On each occasion anthropometric assessment  s of height and weight were taken. Physical activity and sedentary behaviour were measured by accelerometry. Results Significant effects were observed for vigorous, moderate and light activity for the intervention group compared to the control group. Significant intervention effect on sedentary behaviour was observed, neither for self-reported TV/DVD or -to-sit transition counts and steps were also compared with video data. The accuracy of step counts measured by the ActivPAL was also compared against the New Lifestyles NL-2000 and the Yamax Digi-Walker SW-200 pedometers. Results We observed a perfect correlation between the activPAL monitor in time spent sitting/lying, st and ing, and walking in simulated free-living activities. In the study, children who lived with both parents and children with one or more siblings were less likely to reduce sedentary behaviour.

College students ( 52 men, 52 women ) performed a stressful speech task alone or in the presence of a supportive confederate. There was an interactive effect of social support and cynicism on cardiovascular reactivity : Low cynicism participants who received support has smaller increases in blood pressure during the speech than low cynicism participants without support and high cynicism participants with or without support. Participants'psychological stress appeared to mediate the main effects of support on blood pressure reactivity, but not the Support x Cynicism interaction. Results suggest that cynical attitudes may undermine the stress buffering potential of interpersonal support. The social and biological data were collected ; biological data used to assess AL were collected at the Oakl and, CA and Chicago, IL sites ( N=844 ). RESULTS Social strains were most strongly and positively related to overall AL ( Cohen's d=.79 for highest vs. lowest quartile ), and to each of its component biological subsystems, independent of social ties and support as well as sociodemographics and health behaviors. Weak social connectedness, however, is largely regarded as a second-tier health-risk factor in clinical and research setting s. This may be because the mechanisms by which this factor impacts on physical health are poorly understood. Budding research, however.

18457601," OBJECTIVE To assess the knowledge of pregnant women regarding the prevention of neural tube defects ( NTDs ) and to determine how this is affected by time, being folate aware, having seen folate promotional material or being pregnant. RESULTS To determine whether comprehensive preconception risk assessment at the time of a negative pregnancy test followed by referral to primary care services is effective in improving treatment for women with preconception risk factors. METHODS A cohort of women who had been exposed to the family planning preconception program.. Women were assigned r and omly either to a usual care group or an intervention group. Women in the latter group were informed about the risks identified and received an appointment with a primary care clinician who was also informed. The independent variables were maternal age and social class.. In the current situation, only a few women ( n = 1206 ) received a personal letter from their own GP with an offer of pre-conception counselling.. The women were requested to fill in a reply form, indicating if they were interested, had the correct knowledge ( p<0.001 ) and were not interested in an invitation for folic acid supplementation. Although 86 % of women were aware of the importance of folate, they had taken less than the recommendation ( 400 microg SFA/day ) for women capable of becoming pregnant. The proportion of these women who were interested was significantly associated with age. At enrollment, daily multivitamin intake was very low ( 9 % ) and folate-rich foods were consumed in inadequate amounts. The provision of similar preconceptional programs in family planning clinics may prove a useful approach for promoting intendedness of pregnancy."

Design : R and omized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Setting : A large childrens'hospital serving the urban poor in Kolkata, India. Subjects : Children aged 2–35 months admitted with severe ALRI. There was no difference between the two groups in the incidence or duration of colds. The vitamin C group rated their colds as being less severe, but this was not reflected in different symptom complexes or in fewer sick-call visits or training days lost. This study and the literature do not support the prophylactic use of vitamin C to prevent the common cold. Various mechanisms by which vitamin C could assist this type of patient are discussed. BACKGROUND: BACKGROUND According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015, lower respiratory tract infection is the leading cause of infectious disease death... Vitamin C has a role in modulating resistance to infectious agents, therefore vitamin C supplementation may be important in preventing and treating pneumonia.

This study will compare two approaches to increasing physical activity in adults with ID : a lifestyle physical activity ( light-moderate intensity ) approach and a structured exercise ( moderate-vigorous intensity ). The trial will provide details of the Walk Well intervention, design ed for adults with intellectual disabilities, and a r and omised controlled trial ( RCT ) to test its effectiveness. Methods / design This study aims to determine the effectiveness of a walking intervention group or a waiting list control group. The intervention consists of three PA consultations ( baseline, six weeks and 12 weeks ) and an individualised 12 week walking programme. A range of measures will be completed by participants at baseline, post intervention ( three months and those without intellectual and developmental disabilities. The primary outcome measured with accelerometers was change in mean step count per day between baseline and 12 months. Secondary outcomes included percentage time per day sedentary and in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity （ MVPA ), body mass index ( BMI ), and subjective well being. Participants ’ anthropometric measures ( body weight, BMI, waist circumference, time spent in sedentary behaviour ) and well-being. 66.7 % of participants lived in the most deprived quintile on the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation. At baseline, participants walked 4780 ( st and ard deviation 2432 ) steps per day, spent 65.5 % ( stand ard deviation 10.9 ) of time sedentary and 59 % percent had a body mass in this obesity range. After the walking programme, the difference between mean counts of two groups was significant.

19491064," BACKGROUND Vitamin D has been shown to be involved in the host immune response toward Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation of patients with pulmonary TB, either alone or in combination, would improve clinical outcome and reduced mortality. METHODS Two hundred eight healthy black postmenopausal women, 50 to 75 years of age, were assigned to receive either placebo or 20 microg/d ( 800 IU ) of vitamin D(3 ). We included 365 adult patients with TB starting antituberculosis treatment ; 281 completed the 12-month follow-up. The intervention was 100,000 IU of cholecalciferol or placebo at inclusion and again 5 and 8 months after the start of treatment. RESULTS The primary outcome measure was assessed with a functional whole blood assay ( BCG-lux assay ), which measures the ability of whole blood to restrict luminescence, and thus growth, of recombinant reporter mycobacteria. There were no significant effects on mortality overall, but neither alone ( interaction, P=0.03 ), nor in patients treated with vitamin D or placebo. The incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those who were not ( 168 and 154 cases ; hazard ratio, 1.08 ; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.34 ; P =0.51 ). The overall mean monthly serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were higher in those with the placebo group. The frequency of colorectal-cancer screening and wound healing was similar between the two groups. The study showed no significant differences in serum PTH levels or the markers of bone turnover, although there was a transient decline in PTH in both groups.

In order to research on  the strength of the association between the annual maternal and child mortality in 154 countries and social determinants :  corruption, democratization, income ine quality and cultural fragmentation, we used a mixed linear regression model for repeated measures with r and om intercepts and a conglomerate-based geographical analysis. Results : Residents interacted substantially with pharmaceutical representatives. To do so, we examined the linear evolution over time of characteristics such as length of stay and of 21 "" triggering "" conditions susceptible to increase the case mix of a stay. In case of deviant coding, these triging conditions were checked to direct the audit towards fraud-suspected discharge abstract s. Objectives Our primary objective was to systematic ally summarise empirical evidence of that effects of strategies to reduce corruption in health sector. We compared the results from the single-arm and controlled ITS analyses with results based on conventional aggregated analyses of trial data. The findings were largely concordant, yielding effect estimates with overlapping 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) across different analytical methods. However, our analyses revealed the importance of a concurrent control group and of taking baseline and follow-up trends into account in this health sector. The ITS design is valuable for evaluating the effects of interventions that have been tried and to guide future evaluations of promising strategies for which there is insufficient evidence. The aim of this Cochrane review is to assess the extent to which increased transparency in healthcare, including corruption, can take money away from healthcare, lead to poorer quality care and make access to healthcare unfair, and often affects poor people the hardest..- ).A.

DESIGN A 12-week r and omized controlled trial with 6-month follow-up was conducted. SETTING The study was performed in the rural town of Kahoku, Japan, the population of which is considered representative of the older population of Japan. PARTICIPANTS : Fifty-two healthy participants ( 18 men and 24 women ; mean age, 79 years ( range 75 to 87 years ) ) who were r or omized to a training group. Exercise sessions ( 90 minutes, three times per week ) focused on increasing strength and endurance and improving mobility and balance. The controls repeated the strength testing every 15 weeks. The exercise groups were asked to continue usual activities and not to start any exercise program. RESULTS : The exercise group showed significant improvement in measures of endurance and gait. The control group had a large increase in isometric strength ( 1-RM ) and 26 % for extension. In the trained subjects, there were significant improvements in muscular strength ( 2.1 kg ) and muscle size ( 10 % ). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of progressive resistance strength training ( PRT ) to reduce the fatigue of older people. The exercises were fairly resilient to 10 weeks of cardiovascular detraining and retain newly gained muscular strength for at least 5 weeks, but there was a strong trend towards improvements in gait speed. The ROM group also showed some significant decreases in fatigue and weakness. The study showed significant increases in muscle ( and bone ) cross-sectional area and that they may restart their exercise program and also appreciate the generalized fitness benefits that can be ascribed to becoming more active.

This study evaluated the impact of a group-based DPP lifestyle intervention on diabetes mellitus, i.e., r and omized controlled trial. Participants in the intervention group ( n=172 ) and control group were enrolled and randomized to either a routine care group or the control group. Participants were assessed at baseline ( M0 ) and after 12 months ( M1 ) for anthropometric, dietetic, and metabolic parameters. The hypothesis was that high-risk subjects for type 2 diabetes mellitus participating in NEP would show an improvement in these parameters.. The primary endpoint was conversion into normal glucose tolerance. The intervention group had the highest incidences of diabetes, blood pressure, and dietary intakes of fat, saturated fat, and fibre. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.2 years, the participants were, by necessity, not masked to study group assignment, but had significantly lower BMI, waist circumference ( −2.4 vs. 1.0 cm, p < 0001 ). The relative risk reduction was by intention-to-treat. The incidence of overweight/obesity reduced by 6.0 % ( 95 % CI=4.7, 7.3 ) in intervention group and 28.2 % with LSM + MET ( P = 0.002 ). Community-based programs addressing diet, physical activity, and health behaviors have shown significant benefits on the prevention and management of T2DM, mainly in high-income countries.

The study objective was to demonstrate the prognostic utility of the combined index in patients with estrogen receptor ( ER) -positive, HER2-negative breast cancer treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy. The authors used tissue microarrays from 1,942 patients ( 63 % of all trial participants ) who were r and omized to adjuvant chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with HER2 -positive breast cancer.. The patients ( N = 1,246 ) were treated either with six cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide ( CEF ) or with four cycles of FEC followed by eight weekly courses of paclitaxel ( P = 0.001 ). Both prespecified risk scores including cutoff values to determine a risk group ( low, intermediate, or high ) were assessed. The predictive value of p53 protein expression was assessed. A testing algorithm that relies on accurate, reproducible assay performance is proposed. The overall survival ( OS ) was significantly lower than the tamoxifen-treated group ( P <.0001 ). The prognostic performance of PAM50 was significantly associated with the occurrence of distant recurrence in the high-risk, and the low-risk groups. The absence of benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in ER-positive patients. In univariate analysis, p53 positivity was associated with worse OS with either antibody, but only p53 staining with monoclonal antibody 1801 had significantly worse RFS.

The same implant was used without cement ( group 1 ) and with cement. The migration of both groups was linear from six months onwards. The mean migration rate and the incidence of late aseptic loosening were both greater in group 1. The aim of this study was to compare the intermediate-term steady-state wear of highly cross-linked polyethylene compared with that of conventional ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene acetabular liners in a prospect i ve development studies for early technical modifications and for later pre-trial evaluation. The survival curves of cups which had previously shown early migration were considerably different from those without early migration.

In the first two years, this result ed in a complete circumferential cement mantle discontinuity. For the 37 well-performing stems, continuous but small migration was measured between 2 and 12 years of follow-up. Continued subsidence of 0.08 mm/year ( 95 % CI : 0.05–0.12, p < 0.001 ) was seen in combination with continued rotation in retroversion of the implant. The National Joint Registry and other regulatory services are unable to detect failing implants at an early enough stage... At a minimum of seven years postoperatively, the failed acetabular components showed markedly greater and more rapid cranial translation and sagittal rotation. Both cranial and translation ( hazard ratio = 19.9 [ 95 % confidence interval, 4.94 to 80.0 ], p = 0.005 ). The high failure rates of hip arthroplasty implants  have highlighted the need for more careful introduction and monitoring of new implants and for the evaluation of their safety of medical devices."

In this single-center, prospect i ve study, 21 consecutive adults with GH deficiency and 21 adults with adulthood onset GH deficiency, matched for age, gender, body mass index, and number of anterior pituitary hormonal deficiencies, were included. Baseline differences and differences in the responses in body composition, muscle strength, bone mass, and metabolic indices during 5-yr GH replacement were determined. The patients were r and omized to receive either placebo ( n = 13 ) or GH in a dose of 6.1 - 7 or 2 hr after glucose 7.7 - 11.1 mmol/liter ). The mean initial GH dose was calculated using US mortality rates. RESULTS : After a mean follow-up of 2.3 years, there was no significant difference in rates of death, cancer, intracranial tumor growth or recurrence, diabetes, or cardiovascular events. The average length of treatment for the treated group was 3.6 patient years. The overall mortality and the rate of malignancies were similar to the normal population. The estimated cumulative incidence of GH treatment was low. The total bone mineral content ( BMC ) was increased after 3 years of GH replacement ( P < 0.001 ) and without significant difference ( P = 0.617 ).. The incidence of these patients was higher in women ( 2.29 [ 1.86 - 2.82 ] ) than men ( 1.57 - 1.84 ). In addition, a peak increase in BMC and BMD of 7 and 3 %, respectively, was observed in all cases. The long-term efficacy of GH administration in adult patients with growth hormone deficiency ( GHD ) was not associated with an increased risk of CV disease ( CV ), fatal and nonfatal malignancies, and diabetes mellitus.

We investigated the efficacy of acetyl-l-carnitine ( ALC ) in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction. MATERIAL / METHODS Patients scheduled for elective, primary and isolated coronary bypass surgery were r and omized to two groups. The study was performed in a double-blind fashion. Patients received either 12 g piracetam or placebo at the beginning of the operation. Patients were examined neuropsychologically and studied with H215O PET at rest and during activation with a word-repetition task.. RESULTS The study group consisted of 123 children, the control one -- of 127. The overall cognitive function and the degree of cognitive decline after treatment were assessed. The mean change in score from baseline to 6 weeks after the surgery, we combined the six test-scores by principal component analysis.. The patients themselves appeared in favor of placebo. The postoperative cognitive function was not significantly different between the groups.. The combined score derived from the st and ardized neuropsychologic assessment s was analyzed by using an analysis of covariance with baseline and education as covariates. The analysis showed a significant decrease in cognitive performance at  the 10-mL and 30-mL doses and reduced qEEG slowing significantly ( p < 0.05 ). The improvement was limited to nootropics with cholinergic activity. The aim of this paper is to verify, by a systematic analysis of two randomized controlled trials, the effectiveness of cholinergic agents in treating cognitive deficits. The authors believe that the literature is limited, by the fact that acetylcholine was the first neurotransmitter identified in terms of cognitive deficits, in view of  the role played by cholinergic, in this indication."

METHODS A r and om sample of 3,006 persons in Wichita, KS, were characterized according to the presence of no pain, non-widespread pain, and widespread pain. A sub sample of 391 persons, including 193 with widespread pain, were examined and interviewed in detail. RESULTS The prevalence of fibromyalgia was 2.0 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ 95 % CI ] 1.4, 2.7 ) for both sexes. The values obtained at the follow-up examinations were compared with the baseline and post-treatment values. Results. As compared with baseline, symptom severity ( FIQ, SF-36 ), physical function ( p <.001 ) and quality of life ( SF-6 ) still showed improvements six months after the completion of treatment ( p<0.05 ). The studies had similar design s and measurement instruments, including the PI‐NRS, collected in a daily diary, and the st and ard seven‐point patient global impression of change ( PGIC ) ; ( 4 ) ).. Characteristic features of fibromyalgia -- pain threshold and symptoms -- are similar in community and clinic population s, but overall severity, pain, depression, and functional disability are more severe in  the clinic population. CONCLUSION: BACKGROUND Fibromyalgia ( FMS ) is a syndrome expressed by chronic widespread body pain which leads to reduced physical function and frequent use of health care services. Exercise training is commonly recommended as a treatment. This is an up date of a review published in Issue 2, 2002.

We used the evidence that preemptive analgesia with bupivacaine applied in the area of the surgical incision in patients undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer. In addition to causing patient discomfort, the physical act of vomiting may increase intracranial pressure or cerebral intravascular pressure... Patients who underwent mastectomy and were treated according to the ERAS program were included.. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and operative factors were recorded. The patients were r and omly assigned to receive either intravenous cefazolin 1 g or placebo within 30 min prior to skin incision.. The wound exu date s were analyzed for interleukin-1&bgr;. RESULTS : Mean visual analogue scale pain scores were 2-fold higher in patients who underwent surgery, at 4 and 24 h after the surgery to detect the length of hospital stay and protocol compliance. The final study group comprised 106 breast cancer cases. The overall incidence of SSI ( P = 0.25 ) was also similar between the groups. The mean ( + /- SD ) final intraoperative core temperature was less than 15 degrees C ( p < 0.001 ). The majority of patients undergoing breast reconstructive surgery  and to provide evidence -based recommendations for an enhanced perioperative protocol."
27552970," BACKGROUND Activation of ghrelin is a novel endogenous ghrelin receptor and for the growth hormone ( GH ) secretagogue receptor, has two major functions : the stimulation of appetite and regulation of energy homeostasis. The authors to investigate the effects of anamorelin on human ghrelin, on appetite and other endocrine effects in patients with cancer. We conducted a case-control study on 1359 breast cancer cases and 2389 matched controls, treated with ghrelin. The study was performed on 22 patients with resection for colon cancer ( group 1 ). Group 2, functioning as a comparative group, consisted of 22 healthy subjects with elective laparotomic cholecystectomy.. In vitro studies were performed, and the insulin sensitivity index ( SI ) was derived from the minimal model.  Circulating ghrelin and ghrelin levels and H. pylori serum antibodies were assessed by radioimmunologic assay and ELISA method. The plasma ghrelin level was determined in all sample s and significantly lower in colon cancer patients than in controls. In the bypass group, no significant drop in the GH levels ( median 508.0 ng/mL, interquartile range 398.2 - 633.7 ng/l ). The GHRL single-nucleotide polymorphism rs375577 was associated with a lower risk of insulin resistance ( P = 0.023 ) and higher insulin secretion compared with the saline control. At day 8, 81 % of patients were enrolled in group 1, and 81 % in group 2, with a difference in ghrelin concentration ( P between < 0.01 and 0.04 ). In addition, ghrelin was a hormone with multiple physiologic functions, including promotion of appetite, stimulation of cancer tissue, and muscle wasting. The high-dose ghrelin/ghrelin-receptor agonists is a prospect i ve therapy for disease-related cachexia and malnutrition... The present study demonstrates that ghrelin, the receptor, and treatment with GHrelin/ ghrelin in cancer.A+)."
22889123," A prospect i ve epidemiological field study covering a 2 years period has earlier been published. The study has a parallel group design with two intervention groups ( T and S ) and one  control group ( C ) of Visual Display Unit ( VDU ) operators. The present paper covers the period from 2 to 6 years of the study. After 3.5 years, the C group got the same intervention in terms of new lighting system, new workplaces and at last an optometric examination and corrections if needed. The C group reported a significant reduction in pain severity and h and function following six months of keyboard use. However, there was no corresponding consistent improvement in clinical findings in the alternative geometry keyboard groups compared to the placebo group. Conclusion : A height-adjustable task chair with a swivel function can reduce back and hip pain in sewing machine operators.. The findings may be relevant to workers who perform visual- and speech and -intensive manufacturing jobs. In a second field study 37 secretaries used three different formats of a Chair Evaluation Checklist with 14 items. The results of a factor analysis again confirmed the factor structure of comfort and discomfort. Chairs which can prevent abnormal strain of  the neuromuscular system may aid in preventing musculo-skeletal pain and discomfort, while those who received the curved seat experienced a decline of 0.34 ( 95 % confidence interval, 0.28–0.41 ) points. This could provide a unifying focus for ergonomists and design ers, employers dem and evidence for the benefits attributed to an investment in altering workstations. For desk workers, workstation modifications frequently address the work surface and chair. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a curved seat pan can reduce neck and shoulder pain severity among sewing machine workers. The reason for this paper was that chair interventions in reducing workplace musculoskeletal symptoms."
30626326," The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial was a r and omized primary prevention trial to test the effect of a multifactor intervention program on mortality from coronary heart disease ( CHD ) and to describe how these associations vary with age, data on those factors and on mortality for 316,099 men screened for the Multiple Risk factor Intervention Trial ( MRFIT ) were examined. Net average reductions in the intervention factors were 1.2 % ( plasma cholesterol ), 8.9 % ( daily cigarettes ), 0.4 % ( weight ), 2 % ( systolic blood pressure ), and 11 % for a combined risk estimate. Over an average follow-up period of seven years, risk factor levels declined in both groups. The laboratory-based risk score included age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, diabetes, and total cholesterol. In the non-laboratory ( office-based ) risk score, we replaced smoking cessation, with BMI. We recalibrated risk scores for each sex and age group in each country using country-specific mean risk factors levels and CVD rates. We used recalibrated Risk scores and data from national surveys ( using data from adults aged 40 - 64 years ) to estimate the proportion of the population at different levels of CVD risk  for ten countries from different world regions.  Secondary outcome measures were the effectiveness of using cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk scoring ( total risk assessment - TRA ) and at least 20 % for low-income and middle-income countries ( LMICs ). A total of 3163 people had improved discrimination and calibration compared with the modified Framingham score. The CRITERIA study was similarly categorised as high risk or low risk by the two risk scores. The QRISK2 algorithm explained 43 % of total variance in CVD mortality.. the CV risk factors, total CVD incidence, and CV mortality, the CRACR model and the combined risk scores were similarly classified as low or high risk on CR.A+-)."

The bleeding pulp was irrigated with normal tap water until bleeding had stopped and the exposed pulp was covered with calcium hydroxide followed by zinc oxide eugenol, and finally covered with a semipermanent restoration. RESULTS Thirty asymptomatic permanent teeth with pulp exposures were treated by pulp capping, both clinical ly and radiographically, within three months and were free from subjective and objective symptoms through the observation period ( average observation period was 26 months ). The patients also experienced the therapy positively. These findings and those of others have helped gain more recognition for the outcome of some of the more heavily debated issues in recent years. The success rates of cases in which the pulp showed signs of vitality and absence of periapical radiolucency. At 24 months, the clinical and radiographic success rate was 93 % with no evidence of continued root growth.

24529937," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of pulmonary rehabilitation on exercise capacity and health-related quality of life ( QoL ) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ). Using a single-group prospect i ve design, patients were enrolled in supervised aerobic exercise training for the duration of surgical wait time ( TBC ). The exercise group underwent exercise testing before and after 4–6 weeks of pre-trial rehabilitation , and 6 months after r and omisation to surgery. RESULTS There was no difference in pulmonary function tests between the two groups. Intensive physical therapy ( RT, n=24 ) or endurance training ( ET, n =24 ). Patients with known or suspected resectable non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) were eligible.  Exercise testing including measurement of peak oxygen uptake ( VO2 ), spirometry, and single breath diffusion capacity ( DLCO ) was performed on each patient.. The hospital stay was all equivalent between those groups.. After surgery, morbidity and mortality data were collected and correlated with preoperative data. Mortality and morbidity were found to be significantly effected by exercise intervention. The follow-up period was shorter than that of patients who received no treatment. The mean difference ( SD)-131.6 ( 101.8 ) m and -128.0 ( 90.7 ) m in the Rehab... In both groups the 6MWT declined from baseline to 2 weeks postoperative and then improved up to 12 weeks.. A ten-session preoperative exercise intervention may improve post-surgery recovery and reduce mortality..

A randomized controlled trial was design.. The study recruited 34 diabetic subjects [ glycohemoglobin ( HbA1c ) > 8 % ] with a body mass index ( BMI ) ≥ 30 kg/m2. In a multicentre, double-blind, placebo‐controlled trial of 120 mg  orlistat t.i.d. ( n = 249 ) or a control group ( WLC ; n = 52 ). Initial characteristics of those with syndrome X were similar to the placebo, but after 3 months, then completed a 3 month wash-out period and, finally, shifted to orlistat for another 3 months. The OLM intervention included behavior modification, a low-fat ( ≤30 % of total daily calories ) diet, and moderate physical activity ( ≥150 min/week). RESULTS The mean age was 52 years and mean body weight index was 39.3 ( calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared ). Systolic ( SBP ) and diastolic ( DBP ) blood pressures decreased by 15.3 and 11.4 mmHg, respectively, in the group given orlistat plus a hypocaloric diet. After 1 year, the mean weight loss was lower than that of placebo ( 4.6 ± 0.6 vs. 8.3 + /- 0.8 % ). At the end of the study, BMI had decreased by 0.55 %, and the O + LFD ( -8.5 % ), but the difference between these two groups was not significant.

The design consisted of a nonr and omized control trial in a secondary care setting ( a rehabilitation unit at hospital facility ). The subjects included 25 post-stroke male hemiplegics ( 50 males ) and age-matched 80 healthy controls ( 38 females ).. The maximal peak torques of the knee extensors and flexors were measured in each participant at two different angular velocities ( isometric contraction ), 60 degrees, 120 degrees, and 150 degrees/s were measured by using an isokinetic dynamometer ( Cybex Trunk Extension-Flexion Unit ). There were no significant differences in the mean torque and best work between the right and left directions of tension was evaluated using intraclass correlation. Absolute reliability was assessed using st and ard error of measurement from which smallest real differences were derived. FINDINGS Overall, intracelass correlation coefficients were excellent for both hemiparetic (.891 ) and control ( 0.937 ) groups. Intraclass correlation coefficient for each criterion speed were also high for both groups ( > 0.86 ). Measurement error relative to the baseline tortorque varied between 14.1 % and 26.3 % for hemiphemic subjects and 6.0 - 18.7 % for controls.

We have previously shown that partial substitution of refined wheat-derived carbohydrate in bread with protein and fibre. A third, lower-fibre wheat diet provided further information on metabolic changes and cardiovascular risk factors.. Thirty-eight male subjects [ mean age 59.8 ± 0.6 yr, mean body mass index ( BMI ) 28.3 ± 0·6 kg/m2 ] who were eligible for the study ate an isocaloric diet for 8 weeks. The chickpea diet included canned drained chickpea, bread and shortbread biscuits containing 30 % chickpea flour. The diet included the control diet ( C-diet ).. The diets were isoenergetic to the participants ’ usual diet ( LF ), and low-protein diet ( LG ). Body weight and composition and biochemical parameters were assessed. The primary outcome was change in hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ), that was greater than did the group on diet. During the treatment period, the LG diet led to greater reductions in both fasting serum total cholesterol ( TC ) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) ( P < 0.01 ) and the high wheat fiber diet. In all participants, there was a significant increase in serum TC for pinto bean, black-eyed pea and placebo.

The goal was to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of probiotics or prebiotics on the growth rate of infants fed the supplemented and unsupplemented formulas. Methods : A group of infants were enrolled in a single-centre, double-blind, controlled trial. Those who changed to formula-feeding within 4 wk after birth were r and omly assigned to one of the two formula groups. The infant was fed only the formula and were not breastfed due to parental decision. The primary outcome ( weight gain ) and the secondary outcomes ( length, head circumference and formula tolerance ) were measured throughout the study. The mean proportion of bifidobacteria was significantly higher in the group compared with the control group ( P < 0.001 ). The infants in this study had fewer episodes of all types of infections combined ( P = 0.01 ). They also tended to have fewer upper respiratory tract infection episodes ( P= 0.07 ) and fewer infections requiring antibiotic treatment. The cumulative incidence of vomiting, diarrhea, and total infections was not significantly different between the placebo group, ( 27.9, 20.6, and 10.3 %, respectively ). There were no significant differences in mean length and head circumference.

28079254," BACKGROUND Perioperative management of abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) is commonly restricted to men. Recent studies have indicated that they may prevent cardiovascular events in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. The authors therefore conducted a cohort to study whether the highly & bgr;1-specific thrombus, which has previously been implicated in AAA pathogenesis. METHODS To examine an entire community experience with small AAAs, we conducted a population -based analysis of the recognition, reasons for operation, perioperative mortality rates, and late survival  in Olmsted County. The median follow-up time was 68 months and the median age was 74 years ( range 53–89 ). The primary outcome was mortality. The secondary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, postoperative myocardial injury, and stroke. The proportion of deaths caused by vascular diseases was 61 % ( 101/165 ). In the univariate analysis, low preoperative ejection fraction ( EF ) ( p = 0.004 ), and excessive patient anxiety about the aneurysm ( 5 % ).. In patients with AAA, the incidence of mortality was significantly lower among the atenolol-treated patients than among those who were given placebo. The combined rate of operative mortality and severe complications was 9.8 percent in the open-repair group ( 17 of 174 patients ; 95 percent confidence interval, 5.8 to 15.2 percent ) and 4.7 percent in patients with endovascular-repair. The overall survival for the operated small and large aneurysms was similar. The incidence of AAA have an increased prevalence of coronary heart disease, those people with AAA have a poorer rate of survival than healthy controls.. Several studies have shown that despite pharmacological prophylaxis in reducing the risk of AAA, the effectiveness of AAA has not been proven to reduce the mortality and cardiometabolic risk in people with AA.

25686893," OBJECT Reported rates of CSF shunt infection vary widely across studies. The authors have hypothesized that the key to reducing the shunt infection rate is in reducing bacteria in the operating field and wound. This study was to compare the efficacy and adverse effects of vancomycin versus cefazolin as antimicrobial prophylaxis for insertion of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) shunts, a r and omised prospect i ve clinical trial was performed. Over a 16-month period, all consecutive adult patients who underwent CSF shunt insertion at a university hospital with a high prevalence of MRSA infections were included. The scrub nurse selected a sealed envelope, which contained the assignment of each patient to 1 of 2 treatment groups. The mean and median follow-up was 9.2 and 6.5 years, respectively. Of the 176 patients included in this time period, these patients had a total of 825 shunt infections and 4434 subsequent shunt procedures. The differences in infection rates were analyzed with the Fisher exact test with midpoint value correction, and st and ard statistical methods were used to calculate the 90 % confidence interval odds ratio and number to treat. RESULTS The no-touch technique protocol result ed in a clinical ly significant threefold decrease in infection rate from 9.1 % to 2.9 % ( p = 0.058 at 0.10 level, odds ratio 0.305, confidence interval 0.084 - 1.11 ). We conducted a systematic review of the current evidence of shunt infection incidence. The use of  BioGlide catheters  ( odds ratio [ OR ] 1.91, 95 % CI 1.19 - 3.05 ; p =.007 ) and the use of AMS for CSF shunt surgery wound closure is safe, effective, and may be associated with a reduced risk of postoperative shunt infection."

15330925," BACKGROUND & AIMS This study aim ed to determine whether brief psychodynamic-interpersonal ( PI ) psychotherapy is more efficacious than a psychological control for patients with chronic, intractable functional dyspepsia ( FD ). The subjects were only selected if their symptoms had not improved with st and ard medical treatment over the previous 6 months. At 3 months, the treatment group showed significantly greater improvement than the controls on both gastroenterologists'and patients'ratings of diarrhea and abdominal pain, but constipation changed little. Good prognostic factors included overt psychiatric symptoms and intermittent pain exacerbated by stress, whereas those with constant abdominal pain were helped little by this treatment. This study has demonstrated that psychological treatment is feasible and effective in two thirds of those patients with irritable bowel syndrome who do not respond to standard therapy. The control group received psychiatric treatment inaddition. The experimental group showed a significant improvement compared with the control group on dyspeptic symptoms [ days of epigastric pain ( p = 0.050 ), nausea ( p= 0.024 ), heartburn ( p < 0.001 ), and constipation ( p ≤ 0.047 ) ].

21328298," Background : Laparoscopic surgery has been cl aim ed to hasten recovery and reduce hospital stay compared with open operation. The aim of this r and omized trial was to compare postoperative recovery of patients undergoing major intestinal surgery. The authors investigated the use of a multimodal package in colorectal surgery, to adjust treatment comparisons for prognostic factors, and to undertake subgroup analyses. METHODS : A sample of 50 consecutive patients undergoing appendectomy to an early feeding with opioid-sparing analgesia and traditional care group.  The study was not blinded regarding the mode of postoperative rehabilitation. The primary research question was whether ERAS protocol s lead to less morbidity and mortality. The secondary endpoints were postoperative recovery, time to bowel sounds and passage of flatus or stools, tolerance of solid diet and facial visual pain score. RESULTS The data of two groups such as gender, surgical procedures, complications, TNM stage of tumor, age, operation time and intra-operative blood loss were similar. The mean postoperative hospital stay in FT group was significantly shorter than that in control group ( p = 0.01 ). The median hospital stay was 2 days, with 32 patients staying 2 days after surgery. There were no significant differences in postoperative morbidity, mortality, or readmission rate. The ERAS multimodal strategy was similar ( 69.3 vs. 73.0 years ). the median stay was significantly reduced in the ERAS group ( 5 vs. 7 days ; P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test )..

26864742," OBJECTIVES To establish the usefulness of ultrasonography ( US ) for diagnosing gout and to determine whether there are sonographic features that are characteristic for gouty patients requiring urate-lowering therapy ( ULT ). METHODS To be included in this prospect i ve single-centre study, patients needed toexhibit ( 1 ) proven gout by monosodic urate ( MSU ) crystals in synovial fluid and ( 2 ) US- evidence d urate deposits ( double contour [ DC ] sign and /or tophi ) before starting ULT ( allopurinol [ n=4 ], febuxostat. At baseline and after six months of ULT, one trained sonographer assessed the characteristics of gout and gouty arthritis. RESULTS An optimal model was identified with low number of bones required for scoring ( 7 bones/foot ), high reliability and ability to capture a high proportion of disease. This model included the following characteristics of the  first metatarsophalangeal joint ( 1st MTP ). In 46 patients, a total of 1380 foot joints were investigated. In 1309 joints that were not clinical ly involved, US detected signs indicative of joint inflammation in 9 % ( 121/1309 ). Talo-navicular joint and the first MTP joint were the joints in which the highest number of US findings were found at mid-foot and top-foot, respectively. At MTP joint level, the double contour sign was seen in all patients. In those patients who achieved SU levels of < 6 ml/dl, this sign had disappeared at follow-up. After adjusting for potential sociodemographic and general-health confounders, gout-specific variables significantly impacted on HAQ, including polyarticular involvement OR 3.82 ( 1.63, 8.95 ), presence of tomographic crystals and three to six times of MSU crystal aggregates..

18843614," BACKGROUND To compare the outcomes of home-based ( ST ) in walking capacity in patients with intermittent claudication ( IC ) compared with walking training ( WT ) effects. METHODS Thirty patients with IC were r and omized into ST and WT. Both groups trained twice a week for 12 weeks at the same rate of perceived exertion. ST consisted of three sets of 10 repetitions of whole body exercises. WT consisted of 15 bouts of 2-minute walking. Before and after the training program walking capacity, peak VO(2 ), VO(1 ) and total cholesterol ( DBP ) ), ischemic window, and knee extension strength were measured. The incremental shuttle walk began at 3 km x h(-1 ), and increased by 0.5 kg x h (-1 ) every minute, whereas the constant-pace shuttle walk was performed at to the fixed pace of 4 km xh(-1 ).. Claudication distance ( CD ), maximum walking distance ( MWD ), heart rate ( HR ),, and blood pressure were assessed in each testing session. The patients also completed a test preference question naire. RESULTS CD and MWD for both shuttle walks were greater than the corresponding walking distances achieved in the control group. Ankle index and MPBF increased in groups 1 and 2, but were unchanged in group 3. The activities of Cyt-ox and CS decreased with operation. In the supervised hospital-based exercise group, 68 % ( 51 patients ) had iliac disease vs 32 % ( 24 patients ) with femoral disease. The coefficient of variation between the prediction of walking distance on the basis of the new protocol s and the measured distances were in  the range of 0.05 - 0.6. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicated that shuttle walk testing exhibits similar test-retest reliability as the conventional exercise programmes on IC, the effects of exercise programmes are a relatively inexpensive, low-risk option compared with other more invasive therapies for leg pain on walking and improvement in quality of life."

The study was a cost-effectiveness analysis of a multidisciplinary fall prevention program in older adults. The economic evaluation carried out within a single-arm randomized controlled trial. The intervention consisted of center-based exercise sessions 3x weekly for 8 weeks, 2x weekly from weeks 9 to 24 and weekly behavioral counseling for 10 weeks. Participants : All those aged 65 and over in the least active four fifths of the population responded to a baseline survey. There were 2283 eligible participants from intervention practice s and ( ii ) a trial ( control group ). The analysis was carried out with three different time perspectives. The mean fracture-related cost the year after the intervention was estimated. The average cost per participant was $ 14,221, € 12,544 and € 2,147, respectively. The cost effectiveness was measured as the incremental cost of implementing the exercise programme per fall event prevented.. The overall cost of this intervention was $ 429.18 and the ROI was 127 %. The estimated cost of maintaining the program for older people was not significant. In this case, the total costs were $ 529.86 and $ 1,001 for the PA and health education interventions. The results are preliminary and a longer study is required to treat.. The program was not cost-effective. The health promotion interventions were cost effective. The costs per person were lower than the economic evaluations, but home modifications were not. The study participants were mainly elderly people. In addition to method ological challenges arising from the study, there were no economic evaluations for this study. The PA intervention costs and QALYs gained are comparable to other studies. The economic evaluations of health promotion activities for older population are acceptable with the exception of cost effectiveness that are discussed and to what extent specific methodAR-.) ."
26836148," OBJECTIVES Fluctuations in progesterone levels during the menstrual cycle have been shown to affect physiological and subjective effects of cocaine. Furthermore, our laboratory has demonstrated that following drug-cue exposure, cocaine dependent women with high levels of circulating progestinone display lower diastolic and systolic blood pressure responses and report lower levels of anxiety and drug craving compared to cocaine dependent men and drug-naïve women under double-blind conditions. In the current study we examined the role of the progestin derived neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone ( ALLO ) on stress arousal, inhibitory control and drug addiction in cocaine dependent subjects. METHODS Plasma levels of ALLO were measured using GC/MS in 46 treatment-seeking cocaine independent men and women on day 5 of a 7-day treatment regimen of micronized progesteron ( 15M/8F ) ( 400mg/day ) or placebo ( 14M/9F ) administered in a double blind, r and omized manner. As a control, levels of  the testosterone derived neurosteroid and rostanediol ( ADIOL ) were also measured. All subjects participated in laboratory sessions on days 5 - 7 and they were exposed to a series of 5-min personalized guided imagery of either a stressful situation, cocaine use or of a neutral setting and dependent variables including subjective craving, mood, Stroop task as a measure of inhibitory control performance and plasma cortisol were assessed. Participants were grouped by high or low ALLO levels with no sex differences. There were no effects of micronization progesterolone on the use of any substance.."

Prospective study of referrals by general practitioners to specialist outpatient clinics between June 1990 and January 1994 and detailed comparisons of three phases -- October 1990 to March 1991 ( phase 1 ), October 1991 to April 1992 ( phase 2 ), and October 1993 to January 1994 ( phase 3 ). The frequency of consultations per patient increased in both groups during the study period ( p < 0.01 ). Diabetic patients had more contacts with the physicians than nondiabetic subjects ( p< 0.05 ). In the year before achieving fundholding status both groups were referring more patients than were being seen. Two years later, referral and attendance ratios had increased by 13 % and 36 % respectively for fundholders and 32 % and 59 % for controls. The proportion of total healthcare expenditures spent on drugs increased by a third or more in all types of practice. The study was conducted in a PHO composed of 7 hospitals and approximately 2,900 physicians ( 900 primary care providers [ PCPs ] and 2,000 specialists ). Of the approximately 300 PCP practice s, 21 practice s with at least 2 physicians each were selected for their monthly antidepressant prescriptions, whereas those from non-fundholding practice s increased by 12.9 %.. This is the first up date of this review. Policy-makers are under pressure to control pharmaceutical expenditures without adversely affecting quality of care.. Financial incentives seeking to influence healthcare expenditures after the introduction of generic drug coverage in the UK have continued to grow in countries of all income categories. This study shows that the majority of prescribers'behaviour include budgetary arrangements at primary care and hospital settingA/- .). ). system."

The authors examined the efficacy and safety of the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor sertraline hydrochloride in patients with panic disorder, there is no well-tested, selective noradrenergic ( NA ) and selective serotonin uptake inhibitors. The present study provided systematic data from a double-blind study of paroxetine and placebo, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale. This study was to test the comparative efficacy of selective NA and placebo in a single-blind, randomized controlled trial. The same assessment battery was used in both studies. The outcomes were assessed by the Panic Disorder Severity Scale ( PDSS ). The primary outcome measure of efficacy was panic attack frequency at week 10 compared to baseline. The number of full panic attacks decreased in all three groups during the 12-week study, and improvements continued with long-term therapy. The results indicate that : ( 1 ) the administration of fluvoxamine, as compared with placebo, led to a significant reduction in panic attack severity, while no differences for anticipatory anxiety and avoidance were found. The study also showed that the incidence of panic attacks was not affected by treatment. The evidence base for escitalopram versus placebo was similar. The evidence for efficacy of citalopram versus placebo in panic disorder continues to evolve.

26138144," OBJECTIVES To determine the efficacy of prophylactic nitrofurantoin in preventing bacteriuria after flexible cystoscopy ( FC ) and determine whether prophylactic norfloxacin reduces this incidence compared with placebo. PATIENTS AND METHODS A double-blind trial was performed, r and omizing 234 patients to either 400 mg of norfloxacin or placebo prior to FC. All patients provided a midstream urine specimen ( MSU ) before the procedure, as well as at day 3 and day 7 after FC. In addition, a telephone question naire was performed to correlate the nature and severity of any symptoms associated with UTI. RESULTS Interim analysis was performed because of the low recruitment rate, and a significantly lower infection rate than expected. The incidence of UTI in the intervention group was 0.7 % and in those who received placebo group was 3 % ( p = 0.17 ). There were no statistical differences in demographic characteristics or final diagnoses between groups. The majority of patients ( 5 % ) who had bacteriuria was considered from > 105 CFU /ml.. The frequency of bacteriuria was 3.1 ( range 0 to 10 ) during the study and 0.6 ( range0 to 7 ) 15 minutes after the procedures. The overall infection rate ( de novo and secondary to existing bacteruria ) after FC was 0. In a subgroup of 25 patients who were given prophylactic antibiotics for various reasons, 6 ( 24 % ) reported new symptoms. There are no formal guidelines, and this may be due to a lack of formal summary of  the data."

20512292," In a 6-month prospect i ve study, the efficacy of sublingual nifedipine and nifedipine in the management of hypertensive crisis. We studied 40 patients with diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) greater than 120 mm Hg, and who were without signs of acute target-organ damage. The mean blood pressure was recorded before and after the treatment.. The blood pressure fell after 5 min ( group 1 ) to 171/95 mm Hg and after nifedipine ( group 2 ; n = 10 ), and 10 mg. The greater effect of nifedipine was observed than that of the other drugs. In the first 3 h of treatment, nifedipine capsules induced a faster and greater hypotensive effect than did nifedipine, through the small intestinal mucosa where nifedipine is primarily absorbed. After 15 to 20 min the hypotensive effect was reached in both groups : 157/91 and 158/92 mm Hg. After 24 h, both drugs showed a similar efficacy without significant statistical variations.. For hypertensive urgencies, it is not known which class of antihypertensive drug provides the best results. The reduction in blood pressure persisted up to 6 h. The most significant differences in side effects were observed between the 2 groups. The need for treatment is considered urgent with nifedipine-capsules ( 71 ± 4/52 ± 4 mm Hg ) and with captopril ( 100 + /- 14 min ; p < 0.01 ). If the increase of blood pressure is not associated with risk to life or acute tissue damage, blood pressure control must be implemented slowly over 24 hours. For hypotensive urgencies.

The authors conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing finasteride ( Proscar ), a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, with placebo in the treatment of symptomatic BPH. A total of 75 patients, aged 52–78 y with lower urinary tract symptoms due to mild/moderate BPH, treated for 3 months, were enrolled to treatment with either placebo, or saw palmetto.. Patients were evaluated using the International Prostate Symptom Score, a sexual function question naire, and the prostate biopsy for zonal tissue morphometry and semiquantitative histology studies. RESULTS The mean symptom score decreased from baseline to endpoint. Prostate volume and post-void residual urine volume were assessed by transrectal and transabdominal ultrasound respectively. In addition, the I-PSS and its associated quality of life ( QoL ) score were determined and adverse events were recorded. Baseline parameters were comparable between the active treatment and placebo. After 9 weeks of Permixon ® treatment Qmax increased ( 6.0 % ) and ERc in 12 of 17 cases. In the BPH group treated with S. repens extract on the contrary, ERn were negative for both binding classes ( P = 0.001 ).

This study explores whether mini fibre-reinforced composite ( FRC ) anchors increase fracture resistance of reattached fragments. Materials and methods : Leaving half of the anatomic crowns exposed. The other half had the incisal-proximal edge sectioned by a diamond saw. The reattached tooth were subjected to three reattachment protocol s : ( i ) Simple reattachment, ( ii ) Overcontour preparation, and ( iii ) Internal dentin groove. The first and second groups were divided into 10 subgroups, and the third group into five subgroups ( n = 10 per group ) with respect to five different adhesive systems ( Prime&Bond NT, Adper Single Bond II, adper Prompt L-Pop, Clearfil S(3 ) Bond, G Bond ). A one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test ( alpha=0.05 ) were used to evaluate the influence of material s and technique on the SBS. The fracture resistance was evaluated in a universal testing machine under a compressive load ( 1 mm/min-1 ). The results showed that the choice of material and type of adhesive material affected the fixation strength. The “ taster ” review ( 273 records ) allowed a quick overview of fracture resistance, whereas the resin composite buildup provided the highest fracture resistance. The composite resin reattachment was a procedure that offers advantages, such as preservation of tooth structure and maintenance of color, shape, and even translucency. The aim of this study was to analyze the reattachment procedure to improve the restoration of anterior tooth fractured by trauma."
22265381," Objective Research studies focussing on the fear-avoidance beliefs model ( FABM ) have exp and ed considerably during the last years, however, there has been very little research directed at the elderly. The objective of the present study was to investigate the validity of this FABM in older patients with chronic low back pain ( CLBP ). Method In a cross-sectional study, a group of elderly patients with CLBP ( N=103 ) was compared with an age-matched group of pain-free individuals ( N =59 ) to test the constructs inherent in the FABM. Constructs include  fear avoidance beliefs ( FABs ), disability, disuse, and physical activity. In addition, the relationship of these constructs was also investigated in  the patient group. CLBP- patients had an average age of 71.41 years ( SD=5.2 ) and pain-Free individuals of 71,19 years (SD=4.73 ). Level C represented inconclusive data and level D indicated that no studies met the criteria. Based on a literature search of more than 900 studies, 37 good- quality prospect i ve studies were analysed in detail. RESULTS The results indicated level A evidence for the following interrelations : ( 1 ) Psychosocial variables, especially chronic distress in daily life, depression and work dissatisfaction were clearly associated with the onset of back and neck pain ( 2 ). Psychological variables, and age predicted functional capacity, but not physical activity, and level C represented the transition from acute to chronic pain and disability. Lumbar flexion was predicted by FAB and age. Patients were more fear-avoidant, reported more disability, and displayed less paradoxical, social or objective occupational variables. Among the pain-related cognitions, catastrophizing and fear-Avoidance-beliefs yielded the most empirical support. Among coping behaviour passive coping stretegies such as avoiding behaviour was most important. Patients who tended to suppress or ignore pain in order to finish all activities they started, who were unable to integrate phases of passive relaxation into the daily routine displayed a high risk of chronicity of pain.."

The doses were venlafaxine 75 mg/day or fluoxetine 20 mg /day from days 1‐4, the Raskin Depression Scale ( RASS ), and a Clinical Global Impression. The dropout rate due to side effects was also statistically significantly lower for fluoxetine, but not for mianserin, than placebo. The mean prescribed doses were 15.7 and 15.8 with tianeptine and fluoxetine, respectively ( ITT population ) ( p = 0.944 ). No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups either in frequency or in severity of adverse events. The overall study examined international dosage differences in antidepressant clinical trials, using a data base formed and maintained as a component of a Cochrane review of comparative clinical studies of fluoxetine. The results indicated that the overall efficacy of fluoxetine was greater than that of the other drugs. The majority of patients in the fluoxetine group ( 52.9 % ) had significant improvement over baseline compared to the placebo group. The clinical efficacy of this study was thought to exist in dosages used by clinicians treating mood disorders."

25053215," BACKGROUND The use of financial incentives and penalties to encourage uptake of healthy behaviors is increasingly seen as a viable intervention in developed countries. This study evaluated the efficacy of a low-cost reinforcement intervention to produce initial weight loss.  All identified smokers ( n=56 ) were r and omized to one of two intervention groups : st and ard behavior therapy ( SBT ) ; SBT with supervised walks ( SW ),. The study also examined a no delay vs. 2-day delay of the cash alternative. Generally, cash was selected at 80%-90 % of voucher face values.  A total of 51 adults age 50 + from the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina participated in the study in April-May 2007.  Smoking abstinence at 12 months was the primary outcome used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net monetary benefits.. The intervention group received a fixed payment of $ 50 plus up to $ 25 more per week depending on the number of weekly aerobic minutes ,, and a nominal incentive. The prevalence of a positive tuberculin test was 18.3 %. CONCLUSIONS Monetary incentives dramatically increase the return rate for TB skin test reading among drug users, from attending for vaccinations to taking part in regular physical activity. There is a growing body of research about the effectiveness of financial incentive interventions for health behaviours.. Although the results of these early studies are promising, there is no framework that categorises these interventions. This limits the research community's ability to clearly establish which components of financial incentiv interventions are more and less effective, and how these components might interact to enable behavioural change. We propose a framework for describing health-promoting financial incentives interventions.. There has been some recognition that the nature of this interventions make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about what makes an effective incentive, for whom and under what circumstances. Whilst there was some recognition of  the theoretical complexity of Financial incentive interventions, the majority of studies have not been able to distinguish between the different components of a financial incentive program.."
27452342," OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of direct and indirect composite restorations  in single- or multi-surface cavities. In 157 patients, 176 restorations were made to restore maxillary premolars with Class II cavities and one missing cusp. The specimens were r and omly divided into 3 groups ( n=16 ). In the control group, the cavities were restored with the composite Filtek Z250 ( 3 M ESPE ). Follow-up period was at least 4.5 yrs. The restorations were evaluated clinical ly using modified United States Public Health Service criteria. Replaced or repaired restorations were observed to be excellent or acceptable. The worst finding of all the assessment s was the overall assessment of the restorations.  Clinical performance was evaluated using modified USPHS parameters, while marginal adaptation was judged on replicas, using SEM and a st and ardized evaluation technique. RESULTS Clinical results after 3.5 years revealed a 100 % retention rate with no fractures, sensitivity or recurrent caries for both types of restorations. The reasons for failure were fracture of restoration ( four fillings, five inlays ), deterioration of surface texture quality, marginal and restoration integrity ( p<0.05 ). Marginal restoration fractures ranged between 1 and 2 %, marginal tooth fractures between 3 and 9 %. Differences between the restorative techniques and after the different time observation periods were not statistically significant."
27218592, BACKGROUND : Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) is the most prevalent vaginal infection worldwide and is characterized by depletion of the indigenous lactobacilli. A number of clinical studies indicate that re-colonization with Lactobacillus acidophilus vaginal-probiotic containing oestriol ( Prob ). We conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 54 women with an HPV+low- grade squamous intraepithelial lesion diagnosis in their vagina. The intervention group received a daily probiotic drink during the study period ; the control group received no treatment. All patients were given 200 mg of LACTIN-V at 2 × 109 colony-forming units (cfu)/dose or placebo for 5 initial consecutive days. There have been no published studies addressing Saccharomyces species use in pregnancy. Probiotics are unlikely to be transferred into women with BV. The study was followed up at 1 week and 10 weeks after intervention.. The probiotic group had a significantly higher cure rate of BV ( 87.5 % ) than the placebo group ( 50.0 % ). This study extends the work of research ers who systematic ally investigated the scientific literature on probiotics to prevent or treat urogenital infections.
30514444," AIM To evaluate the clinical and histological response of human dental pulps capped with two different types of dental pulp capping materials, namely, MTA ( mineral trioxide aggregate ) or CaOH. METHODS Forty-eight human premolars were scheduled for extraction due to orthodontic treatment. The teeth were mechanically exposed and r and omly assigned to two groups ; CH and MTA. After root canal treatment, the pulp was capped with a small ( n = 5 ) or the same material. After 30 and 60 days, there were extracted and processed for histological examination and the effects on the dental pulp were scored. The data were subjected to Kruskal-Wallis and Conover tests ( alpha = 0.05 ). RESULTS In five out of the 40 tooth specimens, they were extracted, stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Brown and Brenn for recognition of bacteria. The clinical and radiographic success rate was 93 % with no significant difference between the two material s. The patients were followed for 6 months. The wound area was covered with dentin. The dental pulp tissue was repaired with MTA than in the control group. The histological features showed that groups 1 - 4 were quite similar and inferior to group 5. In the EMDgel-treated tooth, the pulpal response varied from acute inflammatory cell infiltrate with varying degrees to necrosis. The study showed the effectiveness of bio material s and techniques by means of a systematic review and meta‐ analysis."
28003033," BACKGROUND This study examines the predictive value of the Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ), which includes walking, balance, and chair st and s tests, to predict mortality in older adults with a high health status. The subjects were 7,250 community-dwelling non-disabled older adults aged 65 years and older that initially reported no disability.. Pretreatment GA included evaluation of cognition, depression, distress, physical function ( PF ) ( self-reported and objective ly measured ), and comorbidity. RESULTS After the baseline visit, the SPPB, timed 4-m walk, and balance tests.  Data on subsequent hospital admissions and discharge diagnoses were obtained from the Medicare data base.. The prevalence of cardiac dysfunction was 12 % in the 65 - 74 group and 23 % among the ≥75 group. The multivariate models could explain 15 % and 23%, respectively. The mean baseline SPPB score on a scale of 0 - 12, with 12 corresponding to highest performance, was 7.5. In the younger age group,  the mean follow-up time was 2.6±0.46 years, and the adjusted hazard ratio ( HR ) for mortality was 1.78, 95 % confidence interval, 1.45 - 2.17 ). In a multivariable discrete-time survival analysis, patients with poor physical performance had a greater risk of mortality ( hazard ratio 2.52 - 1.57 ) and those with poor mobility ( HR = 1.64,95 % CI 1.24 - 2.16 ). The cardiac dysfunction prevalence in this elderly Russian population was found to be comparable to, but with conflicting results in different subsets of participants. The aim of this study was to perform a meta- analysis investigating the relationship between SPPB scores and all-cause mortality . The chair st +.).A.} "

The Singapore Chinese Health Study is a prospect i ve population -based cohort that enrolled 63,257 women ( aged > or = 65 y ) who had completed a 3-y, cohort-specific, food-frequency question naires ( FFQ ).. We here investigate the association between dietary acid load and bone mineral density ( BMD ), osteoporosis, and fracture risk by renal function status.. The primary outcome was the change in BMD, in men and women combined adjusted for sex, age and non-dietary factors were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry... In multivariable-adjusted models for protein intake, the mean total calcium intakes of the supplemented and placebo groups were inversely associated with all fractures, with a hazard ratio ( HR ) ( 95 % confidence interval ) of 0.72 ( 0.54 - 0.95 ), and 4-hr calcium excretion after an oral load ( P = 0.023 ). In a preplanned analysis of covariance with repeated measures, there was no significant association with total fracture ( RR = 1.05, 95 % CI : 0.55, 0.78 ). The dietary protein intakes  for bone health were adequate.. Adequate supplies of dietary proteins are required for optimal bone growth and maintenance of healthy bone..

30099652," BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES In patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ), alterations in gut microbiota are responsible for producing uremic toxins and contributing to the progression of renal failure. We investigated whether oral administration of a probiotic formulation of enteric bacteria could improve the quality of life in patients with end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ). This study was to evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation for 3 months on plasma biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. The study group consisted of 36 nephrectomized and 7 non-nephrectomy ( control ). Patients were r and omized to a placebo group ( nutritional counseling + placebo ). Clinical history and the evaluation of Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale were performed. Gut microbiome composition was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction from fecal sample s. All subjects were followed for 2 months. The tendency towards publication bias was greater with observational and laboratory-based experimental studies ( OR = 3.79 ; 95 % Cl = 1.47 - 9.76 ). The primary outcome was serum IS, total and free ( unbound ) concentrations, and gastrointestinal symptoms in patients of the test group ( P =.0344 ). Additionally, we have confirmed the presence of publication bias in the cohort of clinical research studies.. The mean change in BUN concentration during the probiotic treatment period ( −2.93 mmol/L ), serum creatinine levels decreased in 20 patients ( 43 %, no statistical significance ), and urinary excretion. Conclusion The intake of probiotics in CKD patients was associated with a reduction in serum IL-10. The studies pertaining to probiotic supplementation in ESRD patients were limited and of poor quality overall./.A and). )}+}."
32428841," Background : Dietary energy restriction ( ADF ) is one of the treatment options for  obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) in patients with overweight or obesity. However, the effects of moderate energy restriction on OSA severity are not yet known. In a prospect i ve, controlled trial, twenty-two overweight adults ( mean age 41·0 years, BMI 27·3 kg/m2 ) were assigned to either the nutrition programme ( n 10 ; two fasting days of 730 kcal/d ( 3050 kJ/d ) ) or the control group. Participants were r and omized to 1 ) ADF ( alternating every 24-h between consuming 25 % or 125 % of energy needs ) ; 2 ) CR ( consuming 75 % of needs every day ).. Comparison of microarray and mRNA sequencing showed strong correlations, which were also confirmed using RT‐PCR. In the energy restricted subjects ( body weight reduced by 5 % during a 12 weeks intervention ), there were clear signs of enhanced lipolysis as monitored by mRNA in adipose tissue as well as plasma concentration of free triacylglycerol. The results was the same regarding waist circumference ( −0.4 ± 0.2 vs. 0.3 +/- 0.1 % ). The proportion of small LDL particles decreased ( P<0.005 ) and B-HB ( 0.36+/-.13 vs. 2.23+/-1.00 mmol/l, P = 0.05 ). Higher levels of adiponectin, resistin, total cholesterol, and TNF-α did not change in either intervention group compared with control groups. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, no systematic review and meta- analysis has evaluated the cholesterol-lowering effects of intermittent fasting ( IF ) and energy-restricted diets ( ERD ), respectively. The aim of this review and Meta- analysis was to summarize the influence of IF and ERD on lipid profiles."

In this study, the quantitative relationships between alcohol or other drug use and psychotic symptoms were examined by analysis of prospect i ve data from 4994 adult household residents sample d in a multisite survey of schizophrenia.. Genetic variants were employed as instruments to assess the significance of concurrent associations between cannabis and CUD  and symptoms of psychosis, depression and anxiety at each age... We retrospectively ascertained a large cohort ( N=455 ) of cannabis users and nonusers. The strongest finding across the different analyses was CADM2, which has been associated with schizophrenia and depressive symptoms and disorders at age 26 ( n=759 ). The groups were initially compared on key demographic variables including sex, race, age, age at onset of SZ, parental socioeconomic status, premorbid IQ, education level and global assessment of functioning.. The results suggest that inhibition of an and amide deactivation may contribute to the antipsychotic effects of cannabis. The corresponding estimate from observational analysis was 1.43 ( 95 % CI, 1.19–1.67 ; P-value for heterogeneity = 0.76 ). The genetic markers did not show evidence of pleiotropic effects and accounting for tobacco exposure did not alter the association.

29564527," BACKGROUND Catheter ablation is an established treatment for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( AF ). The potential cost-effectiveness of RFA for AF, relative to antiarrhythmic drug ( AAD ) therapy, has not been fully explored from a US perspective. Methods and results — This study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety outcomes of the treatment with cryoballoon ( CB ) versus AAD. The primary end point was freedom from atrial arrhythmia with absence of persistent complications. In group C, PV ablation was done with a single A rct ic Front balloon ( 23 or 28 mm ), and two 300-second applications per PV. Patients were followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months with 7 days of ambulatory ECG monitoring. RESULTS A total of 172 patients were enrolled at 21 sites, where 161 patients had a study catheter inserted and 160 patients underwent radiofrequency ablation. In the base case scenario, cumulative costs with the RFA and AAD strategies were $ 26 584 and $ 19 898, respectively. Over 5 years, quality -adjusted life expectancy was 83.0 % in group C and 25 ( 68 % ) patients in group R ( odds ratio 0.43 ).. The rate of successful PVI was 63.1 % in CBA versus 97.4 % in RFA ( P = 0.08 ). Procedure times were shorter in the CBA group compared to 167 ( 136 - 202 ) minutes for CRYO and 278 ( 243 - 327 ) minutes to the control group ( log rank test, P =.03 )."
26293406," BACKGROUND Dual-chamber ( AV ) pacing can reduce atrial fibrillation, but the effects on health-related quality of life ( QOL ) are uncertain. We prospect ively studied a 312-patient ( pt ) subgroup of MOST ( MOde Selection Trial ), a 2010-patient, to assess the effect of pacing mode on QOL. The purpose of the study was to identify the incidence and possible predictors of pacemaker implantation  in patients with sinus node dysfunction. The task force was appointed with the advice and consent from the manufacturer. The primary end point was death from any cause or the Pacemaker Syndrome Scale. Functional estimates based on the Canadian Cardiovascular Society criteria were significantly more reproducible ( 73 % ), but not significantly more valid. The Specific Activity Scale was determined from stored pacemaker data. Baseline QRSd < 120 ms was observed in 13% of patients ( 707 DDDR, 632 VVIR ). The average rate of death was not significantly different between the dual-chamber group ( 21.5 % ) and the ventricular-paced group ( 23.0 % ). In long-term follow-up, the time‐dependent covariate Cum%VP was a strong predictor of HF hospitalization in DDDR ( hazard ratio [ HR ], 0.66 [ 95 % CI 0.44 - 0.99 ].. The incidence of late complications following pacemaker implantation is low and compares favourably with early complication rates. The majority of patients in the control group were asymptomatic, but in 93.2 % of simulations at a threshold of $ 100 000. In the rhythm-control group, there were significantly higher rates of pacing -related adverse events ( SSS ) and atrial fainting. The only effective treatment for patients suffering from bradycardia may be implantation of a single-chamber pacemaker, though the only effective modality for treating symptomatic bradieA-R/)...

The second study was conducted to determine the effect of dietary oil supplementation with different FA compositions on anthropometric and biochemical parameters in obese women on a hypocaloric diet. Twelve postmenopausal women ( 58.8 ± 3.7 year ) consumed a low-fat diet ( A16 oil ) or coconut oil. The diets were provided to the participants. Anthropometrics included body weight and lipid profile, total cholesterol, and lipid metabolites. During the study, the total plasma cholesterol level fell significantly compared with baseline values ( P less than 0.001 ) and during the coconut oil ( ChG, n = 19 ), and the soybean oil placebo group ( PG.. These test fats were incorporated separately at two-thirds of 30 % fat calories into high-protein Malaysian diets.. The baseline there were no differences in serum cholesterol, TC ( + 18.2 ± 22.8 mg/dL ), low-density lipoprotein ( LDL cholesterol ) and total and LDL cholesterol concentrations as much as did palm oil. There was no statistically significant difference in the anthropometric, HDL-C, and LDL-C levels between the 2 diets. The study showed that the average plasma TC, LDL cholesterol, Δ% = −8.54 ± 5.6 ; P = 0.01 ). The coconut oil is high in saturated fat and may, therefore, raise serum cholesterol concentrations, but beneficial effects on other cardiovascular risk factors have also been suggested. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the impact of coconut oil consumption on serum cholesterol levels compared with other cooking oils. and.A+-R/). ,}) even  fields single"

The Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension ( STOP‐Hypertension ) was a prospect i ve study that we conducted as a post-marketing survey. We conducted a prospective observational study of the efficacy and safety of these combination therapies in older ( ⩾65 years ) and younger ( < 65 years ) hypertensive patients. The treatment regimen was as used in the main trial : indapamide SR 1.5 mg ( plus perindopril 2 - 4 mg ), the total numbers of patients with the same target blood pressure of less than 150/80 mm Hg. The primary outcome was all stroke, and secondary outcomes were mortality, cardiorenal events, and total mortality. In the study, patients were r and omized to one of three treatment groups : “ conventional ” antihypotensive therapy with beta‐blockers or diuretics ( atenolol 50 mg, metoprolol 100 mg, pindolol 5 mg, or fixed‐ratio hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg plus amiloride 2 - 5 mg ). The mean blood pressure while sitting was 15.0/6.1 mm Hg ; the incidence of stroke was similar between the 2 groups ( p = 0.99 ).

Design Multicentred cluster r and omised controlled trial, with secondary prevention. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of AF. We performed a retrospective cohort study of a self-applied wearable electrocardiogram ( ECG ) patch in patients aged 65 years and over in the primary care centers of the Spanish National Healthcare System. RESULTS We enrolled 2580 patients, 65 years of age or older, with a CHADS-VASc score ≥2, in whom a pacemaker or defibrillator had recently been implanted. We monitored the patients for 3 months to detect sub clinical atrial tachyarrhythmias ( episodes of atrial rate > 190 beats per minute for more than 6 minutes ) and followed them for a mean of 2.5 years. The mean age was 59.2 years ( 95 % confidence interval, 58.6 - 59.8 years ). An analysis comparing alternative combinations of start age and screening interval found that less frequent screening with a later start age may be more cost-effective than an annual screening.. Clinical events and patient attitudes/experience were also evaluated. Results : We studied 1001 patients ( 500 iECG, 501 RC ) who were 72.6 % and the blood pressure device showed superior specificity compared with pulse-check ( p < 0.001 ). The primary end point was the incidence of AF, which was 17.7 % ( 14.1 - 21.3 ). In 10 % of patients, AF was not known prior to screening, the screening program was not identified..

A previous study of the EuroQol Group was to quantify the effect of these agents on the incidence of stroke and the prognostic value of AF. We aim to determine the efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with warfarin. The cohort of patients with an implanted ICM ( Reveal XT, Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, Minn ). Data from the EQ-5D ( EQ‐5D‐3L ) question naire, was used to study validity. A cohort of 1753 patients with AF or atrial flutter were r and omly assigned to receive apixaban ( 5 mg twice daily ) or aspirin ( 81 - 324 mg per day ). The mean follow-up was 1·1 years. The primary efficacy outcome was stroke or regional embolism, the primary safety outcome was major bleeding. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for identifying patients with any AF were higher than the control group ( 3.0 % at 36 months ).. The modified “ dependency ” question had excellent sensitivity ( > 85 % ), specificity ( > 79 % ), and accuracy ( > 82 % ) for identifying dependency after stroke.

Sixty human third molars were sectioned 3 mm below the occlusal level and then r and omly divided into six groups of five each. The authors placed 30 restorations with the SE material ( Clearfil SE Bond, Kuraray America, New York ) and 36 restorations with Prime & Bond NT ( Dentsply Caulk, Milford, Del. ). After caries removal, each group was subdivided into two groups for two-step ( SE Bond ) or one-step treatment with 17 % EDTA. The specimens were then transversally cut just above the pulp chamber using a diamond saw ( composhave 4255 Intensiv ) thus obtaining twenty coronal fragments and 20 radicular fragments. Bond strength data were analyzed using three-way ANOVA and Tukey's test. For interfacial nanoleakage evaluation using a field-emission scanning electron microscope, caries was similarly removed from the remaining thirty carious molars, bonding was performed as for bond strength testing, and the teeth were sectioned. RESULTS Mean µTBS values and st and ard deviations in MPa were : G1 = 11.89 ± 4.22 ; G2 = 19.41 ± 5.32 ; G3 = 11-34.05 ). The dentin surface pretreatment with SE adhesive resulted in a significant reduction in bond strength. The application of the above-mentioned surface pretreatments did not affect the bonding of SE adhesives. The bonding of dentin to 5 % NaOCl treated with SE and SE adhesive was not statistically different from each other.

25609995," BACKGROUND Pain is the primary indication for total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) ; however this may not be the case after this procedure. A group with no pain and one with severe pain at 5 years were statistically compared. The following were significant predictors of poor pain outcomes :  age below 60 ( 17 % ) compared with above 60 ( 7 %, P <.05 ). Previous research has suggested that high levels of both catastrophizing and depression are associated with elevated acute postoperative pain. The study sample consisted of 120 patients ( 73 women, 47 men ) with osteoarthritis of the knee who were scheduled for TKA... The mean age, pain catastrophizing, twelve, and twenty-four months postoperatively. The Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ), Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ), and demographic data were obtained . In all the active treatment groups, patients reported greater pain-related anxiety and less acceptance of pain than the other groups. The results suggest that the pain catastrophizing is a construct that reflects anxious preoccupation with pain,  in the months and years following surgery. In the present study, only pain catastrophizing contributed significant unique variance to the prediction of postoperative pain intensity. The number of comorbidities per patient predicted the presence of pain, while the number of pain catastrophizing and the level of pain intensity on day 2 ( P =.009 ), were not. Pain catastrophizing was a significant predictor of chronic pain, as measured by the Pain Rating Index subscale of  the MPQ. After adjusting for these predictors, we found that patients with chronic pain following TKA, especially those with pain catastrophizing, had a higher incidence of pain..A+).-/} R) and, ]  even-."

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, r and omized multiple-dose ( 0, 375, or 750 mg per day for 3 months ) study in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In a rand omized crossover design, 20 adults were randomized to receive either 1500 mg of decaffeinated GTE or placebo ( cellulose ) daily for 4 weeks. The 49 subjects who completed this study were predominantly white with an average age of 65 years and a median duration of diabetes of 6 years. At baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment, anthropometric measurements, fasting glucose levels and a lipid profile were measured from both groups. At 6 weeks, participants of each group consumed their design ated beverages with breakfast and consumed lunch 3 h after breakfast. Venous blood sample s were collected in the fasted state ( 0 h ) and at 2, 4 and 6 h after lunch. Postpr and ial glucose concentrations were 3 % lower in those who received GTE. The relationship between cocoa flavanol levels and interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) concentrations was quadratic, suggesting that a maximum effective dose was achieved ( quadratic contrast, P=0.01 ). There were no significant effects on measured indices of glucose regulation, nor on those of total 8-isoprostane, CRP and insulin-6 concentrations, when compared with the placebo. This systematic review evaluated the effect of GT/GTE on insulin resistance and glycemic control in people with pre-diabetes/type 2diabetes mellitus ( T2DM )."
28506257," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment for fibromyalgia.. We conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial with fibromyalgia, which included two groups of patients with fibromyalgia. The primary outcome measure was the difference in pain intensity. The secondary outcome measures were the number of tender points. The study was conducted to treat the fibromyalgia syndrome. The patients were treated with the following treatments : group A ( n = 8) received the usual care and group B - the acupuncture. The outcome measures used in this study were pain intensity ( visual analogue scale ( VAS ) and the McGill pain questionnaire. The treatment group were significantly better than the control group in all measures of pain, and in 5 of the SF-36 subscales. After the 6 months, the pain score ( U = 25.0 ; P = 0.022 ) in group B decreased significantly. The largest difference in mean FIQ total scores was observed at the end of 4 weeks.  Positron emission tomography ( PET ), that is, pain intensity, were significantly improved in the homeopath care group compared with those the placebo group.. There were no significant differences in any other outcome measures... The quality of life was significantly improved after the study.. Rehabilitation of fibromyalgia ( FM ) is the most common type of treatment.. the total score for AMSTAR was significantly higher in RES-C ( 92.0 + /- 7.5 % ) than in RES ( 82.8 +.. ).

22796243," Study Design. A clinical trial comparing a  back pain group with a pain‐free group.  Objectives. To investigate the main effects and interactions of postural and cognitive difficulty on postural control in people with chronic low back pain ( LBP ) compared with healthy participants.  Postural performance was quantified by RQA % recurrence, % determinism, entropy and trend.  People with nonspecific LBP ( n=22 ) and healthy controls were enrolled.  Center of pressure parameters were measured by two piezo-resistive electrogoniometers and a force platform for the conditions as follows : ( 1 ) quiet stance with and without vision, and ( 2 ) in anticipation of postural instability due to a ballistic arm movement or ankle muscle vibration. The postural stability was measured by a numeric rating scale ( NRS-11 ), an equal number of patients ( n = 11 ) was enrolled per pain score. The results confirmed increased postural instability in pain sufferers compared to healthy controls. In addition, regression analysis revealed a significant and linear increase in postural sway with higher pain ratings for all included COP parameters.. The high prevalence of back pain demonstrates the importance of pain management in the treatment of osteoporosis. Furthermore, the finding of self-reported back pain as a determinant of both balance and functional mobility suggests that this measure may deserve attention when screening women with LBP. The research question to be answered in this review was : "" Is there any difference in postural control between subjects with or without LBP across several sensory manipulation conditions? "". The present data suggest that postural deficit may be dependent on experimental conditions in which subjects with LBP have been assessed. The dual-tasking did not change the postural performance of nonspecial LBP subjects with low level of pain and/or disability...  Is this difference of postural sway between subjects without and without LBP at any level of and.A).."
24166727," OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of dietary low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol intervention on fat intake and fatty acid compositions in children with cow's milk allergy ( CMA ) and multiple food allergies ( MFA ). STUDY DESIGN Hypoallergenicity was determined by performing blinded oral food challenges in 31 consecutive children with documented CMA.  Growth, tolerance, and biochemical response were evaluated during a nonr and omized feeding study with each child serving as his or her own control. RESULTS Of this IgE-associated CMA cohort ( ages 3 to 41 months ), 14 % ( 95 % CI = 7. 7%-22.7 % ) were determined to have soy allergy, 12 definitely at entry and 1 possibly after 1 year of soy ingestion. The latter child experienced severe failure to thrive at enrollment and exhibited improved growth while receiving soy during follow-up but was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis at study completion. Improved growth ( P <.05 ) occurred in the non-soy-allergic cohort ingesting soy formula ( 579 31 mL/d ).. Dietary elimination of those taking supplements still did not meet their RDA. Patients on budesonide had fewer courses of systemic corticosteroids and more symptom-free days than did those on placebo. The intake of unsaturated fat differed only slightly. Dietary ratios of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids ( PS ratios ) of the intervention and control diets were 0.44 and 0.33, respectively ( P=0.0001 ). The removal of dietary antigens significantly improved clinical symptoms and esophageal histology in 98 % of patients.. Feeding an AA result ed in improved growth compared with feeding eHF, despite similar dietary intakes. The current recommended treatment for food allergy is strict elimination of all the allergens from the diet."

12917993," In 1983, a multicenter trial of recombinant human growth hormone ( GH ) was started in girls with Turner syndrome. Fifty-four patients were r and omly assigned to receive GH, 8 IU/m2 3 times/week ( group 1 ) or in combination with 25 ng/kg.day ethinyl estradiol ( E2 ; group II ). The mean pretreatment height velocity was 3.8 cm/yr for both groups. Twice daily injections were given as one third in the morning and two thirds at bedtime. All girls who were older than 12 years at the beginning of the study received low doses of estrogen. During the 1st year of therapy, there was a striking increase in height velocity ( HV ) in both groups, from 4.0 + /- 0.8 to 6.3 cm/year.. Height velocity expressed as the SD score for chronological age ( Turner references ) was 0.0 - /- 1.2 for group I and 0.2 + / - 1.4 for group II. The last height measurement obtained, which was considered as ( near ) final height, was approximately 20.9 cm, compared with their mean original projected adult height. These results, combined with those of a prospect i ve GH dose-response study, suggest that better long-term results can be obtained with early and prolonged treatment and if the GH dose is individually adapted to the short-term growth response.. The overall growth velocity ( mean ( SD ) ) was not significantly different between the once daily and the twice daily regimens ( 7.6 ( 2.3 ) v 5.1 ( 3.2 ) cm ). Untreated women are approximately 20 - 21 cm shorter than normal women within their respective population s.

24529402," BACKGROUND Remote in-home monitoring ( RM ) of symptoms and physiological variables may allow early detection and treatment of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ). The current authors postulated that a simple and well-st and ardised, low-intensity integrated care intervention can be effective to prevent such hospitalisations. The study aimed to provide a comprehensive description of the method ologies used in home telemonitoring interventions for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. A total of 111 patients were suitable for inclusion and consented to be r and omized. Participants in the intervention group received a telecare device kit and they were asked to monitor their oxygen saturation, pulse rate and respiration rate using the device and to transmit the data to an online network platform. The primary and secondary outcomes were the St George's Respiratory Question naire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression and the EuroQoL EQ-5D quality of life scores before and after pulmonary rehabilitation, and then periodically during the trial. There were significant and clinical ly important improvements in terms of patient satisfaction, total admissions, pulmonary function, hospital re-admission and use of emergency room services. After the study, there were no differences between the groups for the use of both homecare and hospital care. CONCLUSION Capturing the full potential of these new technologies will require a much more fundamental reorganization of work than just a simple deployment of technology."
24618584," BACKGROUND This study evaluated the effects on smoking behavior of providing contingent reinforcement for  nonsmoking  versus  reduced smoking  afternoon breath carbon monoxide ( CO ) target levels. This study was design ed to increase workplace smoking cessation rates by offering both a choice of intranasal ( LAIV ) and injectable ( TIV ) influenza vaccines to eligible employees. Evaluation was based on cohort and cross-sectional surveys. RESULTS Of 10,000 total employees in treatment work sites, 2041 and 270 participated in weight control and smoking cessation programs.  Weight losses averaged 4.8 lbs, and 43 % of smoking participants quit. Net 2-year reductions in smoking prevalence in the treatment vs control work sites were about 9 % and 20 %, respectively. We conclude that financial incentive interventions have been suggested as one method of promoting healthy behaviour change.. The intervention group received a fixed payment of $ 50 plus up to $ 25 more per week depending on the number of weekly aerobic minutes ,. Receiving all scheduled injections were 77 % of incentive versus 46 % of control participants ( p=.107 ). A significantly larger percentage ( 74 % versus 51 % ; p=.016 ) of participants were smoking cessation within the first 6 months after enrollment and rates of participation in and completion of smoking-cessation programs. BACKGROUND The incentive group had significantly higher rates of smoking cessation than did the information-only group 9 or 12 months after enrolment ( 14.7 % vs. 5.0 %, P<0.001 ). Rates of TIV increased by 15.9 percentage points for the Choice Plus arm versus Control for workers aged > or = 50 years ( p=0.024 )."
25329390," OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of an 8-week, 24-session weight-bearing physical conditioning program on disease signs and symptoms in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. METHODS In a within-subjects, repeated measures design, 25 subjects, ages 8 - 17 years, with chronic polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis ( JRA ), were enrolled in a r and omized, single-blind controlled trial. Both groups participated in a 12-week ; 3-times-weekly training program consisting of high-intensity aerobics in the experimental group and qigong in  the control group. Subjects underwent exercise testing measuring submaximal oxygen uptake at 3 km/hour ( VO(2submax ) ) as the primary outcome, maximal oxygen uptake, and peak power at the beginning and end of the program. Physical function was measured using the Child Health Assessment Question naire ( C-HAQ ). RESULTS The exercise program was well tolerated in both groups. There was no difference in VO( 2submax ), and any other exercise tests between the groups through the study period and no indication of improvement. Subjects exercised twice a week at their rheumatology center and once a week on home, using a commercial exercise video-tape supplied by the investigator. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that activity programs with or without an aerobic training component are safe and may result in an important improvement in physical function. The intensity of exercise training did not seem to provide any additional benefits, as well as identify potential determinants of leisure participation."
27460566," OBJECTIVE To assess the survival rate of two different post systems after 5 years of service with a prospect i ve r and omized controlled trial. METHOD AND MATERIAL S One hundred patients in need of a post were studied. Half of the patients received long glass fiber-reinforced posts ( GFREPs ) were restored using Snowpost : 34 incisors, 12 canines, 25 premolars and 16 molars. The posts were cemented with RelyXUnicem and the core was made with a resin composite ( Dentocore Automix ). Every tooth was covered with a metal-ceramic or all ceramic crown. Statistical analysis was performed using the log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Additionally, a Cox regression was performed to analyze risk factors. RESULTS The success rate of fiber-reforced posts was 71.8 %. In the metal screw post group, the analysis of variance ( anova ) followed by Tukey's test ( alpha = 0.01 ). Metal posts result ed more often in more unfavorable complications ( eg, root fractures ).. After 84 months of observation ( mean = 71.2 months ), 7 restorations failed ( n = 17 ), which presented the highest fracture resistance values. In Group A the failure observed was 6.67 % and in Group B it was 26.20 %. The follow-up test showed that the post lengths were not crowned after obturation. The authors were not able to predict the fracture resistance of prosthetically restored roots. These results suggest that it is not necessary to perform excessive intra-radicular post-space preparation to improve the healing of teeth. Exact 95 % confidence intervals for the difference between the 2 experimental groups were calculated. CONCLUSIONS At the 1-year recall, no failures were reported. The present systematic review aim at assessing data from the literature on endodontic and single crowns ( SCs ) or fixed dental prostheses ( FDPs )."

MATERIAL S AND METHODS : A total of 150 patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer following EBRT in 58 cases, and IRT in 42 ( 28 retropubic ) and ( 14 transperineal ). Clinical information was obtained from a systematic review of the literature. Therapy for PSA relapse after RP is defined by PSA < 0.5 ng/ml. The primary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival ( OS ), and the secondary end point was time to pain progression ( TPP ). RESULTS A 33 % reduction ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = 0.67 ; 95 % CI, 0.57 to 0.77 ). This trial pre date s the requirement for clinical trial registration. In most trials, the median overall survival was 11.9 months in the group given docetaxel and /or placebo. The median survival was not reached... treatment of prostate cancer was the same as the control group.. The majority of patients ( 92 % ) had a total PSA decline of at least 50 % and this must be confirmed by a second PSA value. The treatment effect was also observed with the use of an unadjusted Cox model and a log-rank test ( p =.006 ). Treatment of CRPC was similar to the treatment with docetaxel, and no significant difference in prostate cancer mortality was observed.

30185438," BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is the most common arrhythmia to occur after cardiac surgery. An exaggerated inflammatory response has been proposed to be one etiological factor. We tested whether the use of intraprocedural corticosteroids to limit the extent of tissue edema and /or inflammation alters the prevalence of spontaneous and adenosine-induced acute AF recurrence. METHODS A total of 125 patients with paroxysmal AF who received radiofrequency ablation treatment  were r and omized to a 3-month course of colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily or placebo.  C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and interleukin ( IL)-6 levels were measured at baseline and after a 12-month follow-up. Patients underwent 30 day event monitoring  ( 3 days ). During the blanking period, 51 of the 138 ( 37.0 % ) patients experienced ER after atrial fibrillation ablation. The steroid group had a lower rate of ER than the control group ( 15/64 [ 23.4 % ] versus 36/74 [ 48.6 % ], P=0.003 ). There was no difference between the 2 groups about late recurrence of AF during the first 24 months after ablation... The incidence of postoperative AF was significantly lower in the colchicine group ( 7/23 % ) versus 1 in  the placebo group ( 1.3 %, p = 0.03 ).. Treatment with steroids led to higher reductions in CRP and IL-6 levels. The 1-year freedom of  AF recurrence after catheter ablation ( 26 [ 22.2 % ] vs. 13 [ 14.6 ].

We conducted a long-term, double-blind trial ( n=36 patients ). Fourteen patients with BPH ( mean age 67.9 + /- 7.8 years ) were enrolled to receive either the alpha-blocker ( T-N group ) or the anticholinergic agent ( n = 44 ). Before and 4, 8 and 12 weeks after treatment, International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS ), and maximum urinary flow rate ( Q(max ) ) and Qmax were determined. In the placebo group at 12 weeks, 6 items of IPSS, total prostatic volume ( TPV ) and the residual urine volume were compared between the groups. RESULTS : The mean total IPSS. the PVR, the improvement of voiding symptoms and quality of life ( QOL ) tended to improve in both groups. The risk of BPH progression was significantly greater in patients on placebo, than for those on the A1d receptor. The overall efficacy did not differ significantly between two groups, and no difference in IPSS improvement was observed between them. The risks of acute urinary retention and transitional zone volume were significant decreased in 5alpha-reductase inhibitor groups ( P < 0.001 ) and finasteride ( P = 0.003 ). In regard to voiding function the maximum urinary stream rate was significantly higher in those who had BPH. The treatment aims are to relieve symptoms and prevent disease-related complications. The 75 mg/day administration was to reduce the incidence of urinary retention. and.A)."

The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of a 9-month jumping intervention on current and future low back pain in adolescents. Methods. A total of 10 type 2 diabetic subjects and 7 healthy men ( control subjects )  were included in this study. The other 27 who did not perform in any kind of regular physical activity other than that programmed during the compulsory physical education courses comprised the control group.  Bone mass and areal density were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ). In general, qualitatively similar responses were obtained in both groups. During the clamp, leg blood flow was higher ( P < 0.05 ) in trained versus untrained legs.. A positive attitude to aerobic exercise  and high performance in the nine-minute run test among the boys and the girls decreased the risk of smoking.  Leisure sports activities together with body mass index at young ages were the most powerful predictors of adult biological risk factors. The ratio of BMC to MVC ( BMC /MVC ) in upper and lower limbs was compared using Student's t-test... At the age of 40, the Baecke sports index was an independent predictor of total body BMD, whereas the two-h and lift performance significantly predicted BMD ( after BMI ).

Methods — This study incorporated 2 complementary strategies : a prospect i ve, single-center, cohort study and an analysis of Scottish routine hospital discharge data. The study comprised 24 stroke patients ( aged > or = 50 ) with chronic stroke and the nondominant arms of 10 similarly aged healthy persons.  Torque-generation parameters were assessed at baseline and 6 months, respectively, 1.4 ( 95 % CI, 0.92 to 2.07 ) times the rate of hip fracture in the general population.. The two BWSTT periods of 1 week each, with or without supplementary treatment,, and gait analysis, were compared. The BMD values ( g/cm2 ) were determined the same day and after 6 months. The baseline and poststroke BMD values were found to be significantly different. Upper and lower limb BMDs were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Additionally, the pattern of changes was significantly higher in patients with stroke than that of the control subjects. The mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin B concentrations in patients were significantly lower than in those of their control group ( P < 0.05 ). The hip BMD was decreased significantly compared with the paretic side ( p<0.01 ). In the nonaffected ultradistal radius there was significant correlation between the level of bone changes  post-stroke...

The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ), the secondary outcomes were the incidence of depression.. The placebo group was included to the study. The efficacy was assessed by the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( HAM -D ) total score and CGI - Severity score. A comparison of duloxetine with placebo was performed but no comparison with venlafaxine, which is another antidepressant in this therapeutic class with a significant market share. There were no statistically significant differences between duloxetine - and placebo -treated patients. The majority of duloxetine versus placebo was similar. The mean time to onset of depression was significantly higher than placebo... In the absence of relevant data to assess the place that duloxetine should occupy in treating depression, duloxetine and placebo were used to create meta-analyses.

In the present study, the prevalence of depression treated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS ) and its relationship with age is unclear.. The study targeted the elderly population. The HADS was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the intervention for older adults with GAD. RESULTS The GHQ-28 was an internally consistent measure. Cronbach's alpha, split-half coefficients and test-retest reliability were 0.9, 0.89 and 0.58 respectively. The overall prevalence of these groups were compared with regard to their functioning, subjective well-being, and use of health care services, while controlling for potentially confounding variables. CONCLUSIONS Twelve weeks of 10 to 20 mg/d of escitalopram ( n = 85 ) or matching placebo ( N = 92 ). The two-factor structure proved reasonably stable when the study group was r and omized.. Using a loading of 0.6 or greater, their use of appropriate care was generally low. The results showed that the anxiety measures had a greater reduction of symptoms than CBT on anxiety ( Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ; HARS ) and various disease-specific quality of life outcomes. The impact of age is shown but the majority of participants ( 57 % ) were healthy. The majority of respondents were elderly.

25913420," BACKGROUND Low levels of physical activity appear to be associated with insulin resistance. However, the detailed associations of these complex relationships remain elusive. We examined the prospect i ve associations between self-reported TV viewing time, objective ly measured time spent sedentary, at light-intensity activity, and at moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity ( MVPA ). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In 192 individuals ( 81 men and 111 women ) with a family history of type 2 diabetes, we measured  physical activity and anthropometric and metabolic variables at baseline and after 1 year of follow-up in the ProActive UK trial. Physical activity  was measured objective ly by accelerometry. Insulin resistance was expressed as fasting insulin and the homeostasis model assessment score ( HOMA-IR ). Analysis was done by intention to treat. This study is registered, number IS RCT N92162869. FINDINGS Of 593 eligible individuals, 99 were assigned usual care, 248 the diet regimen, and 246 diet plus activity. Outcome data were available for 587 ( 99 % ) and 579 ( 98 % ) participants at 6 and 12 months. In longitudinal analyses, higher baseline sedentary time  was associated with 3-year increases in fasting glucose, average HDL size, Apo A1 and HDL-cholesterol ( partial r = 0.28 to 0.50, p <.027 ), whereas SED was not ( Partial r = -0.003 [ −0.007 to -0·01 )... The association remained significant after adjusting for time invested in activity of moderate or vigorous intensity. However, our results must be interpreted carefully due to possible effect-modification by gender and a low sample size."

Methods : In the present double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in seven centres in five West European countries, 830 healthy infants were enrolled and r and omized to either 0.4 g/dL or with 0.8 g/dl oligosaccharides. The infants were recruited before the age of 8 weeks, either having started with formula feeding or being fully breast-fed ( breastfeeding group ). At study day 1 and study day 28, the fecal species, colony forming units ( cfu ) and pH were measured and analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance. Infants were to be seen at DOL 14, 35, 56, 84, and 119. The incidence of gastroenteritis was lower in the supplemented group than in those controls ( P = 0.04 ). The stool characteristics were compared between the groups. The prebiotic and control groups showed similar mean weight, length and head circumference, skin fold thicknesses, arm circumference gains and stool frequency. The mean stool consistency was higher in infants that were exclusively formula fed. The study group had a lower stool mean pH and an increased proportion of acetate and a decreased proportion of propionate. The median number of bifidobacteria ( P < 0.0001 ) and lactulose, and the mean pH of the formula group were higher than control at 30 and 60 days, whereas at 52 weeks were strikingly smaller. The administration of formulae supplemented with pro- and /or prebiotics compared with unsupplemented formulae."
22008401," BACKGROUND To investigate the effects of incentive spirometry to pulmonary complications after surgery for non-malignant gynecologic disorders.. A r and omized trial was conducted to determine whether a systematic use to prevent postoperative pulmonary function... The authors prospectively rand omized 54 patients undergoing a midline laparotomy incision to the lungs.. Patients were given the spirometer and instructed in its use, as often occurs in clinical setting s. RESULTS : Patients with chronic airflow limitation following CABG surgery were consented in the study. The patients, all of whom performed mobilization and cough procedures, were divided into two groups : exercise control ( EC ), performing only the abovementioned procedures. The control group was instructed to use the incentive spirometer for 3 breaths, once per day, while the others received routine treatment. RESULTS The groups were considered homogeneous in relation to demographic and surgical variables. The incidence of atelectasis was significantly reduced after surgery ( 55 % of the initial value ) and on postoperative days 1 to 5.. During the rehabilitation phase, the percentage of patients with atelectasis was not significantly different between the groups. The mean inspiratory capacity ( IC ) was significantly higher with IS ( 24/1000 patient-days ) compared with the control group ( Kendall ; Neustadt, Germany ). The oxygen saturation was the only variable that was completely recovered on the seventh POD, also without significant differences between groups. CONCLUSION There were not observed significant differences in maximal respiratory pressures, spirometric variables and oxygen saturation in patients undergone surgery, with 2.29 vs. 0.82 L, and 2.56 vs. 1.34 L, respectively. The ICU admission rate was significantly lower. The postoperative respiratory function of patients undergoing surgery, the ICU admission rates, and the IC, were significantly higher than the controls.. Although the authors believe that the pulmonary functional recovery after surgery was significantly greater than control group."
30320723," BACKGROUND Although radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation has long been the st and ard of care for atrial fibrillation ( AF ). We investigated if PV electrical isolation from the left atrium is feasible and safe for the treatment of paroxysmal AF. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety, and procedure times for two such ablation procedures. METHODS AND RESULTS : A total of 360 consecutive patients with atrial flutter or AF undergoing PVI using the CB1 ( 106 patients ) or the CF-RF ( n = 58 ). The mean age was 60 years with 63 % men, a mean LA size of 42 mm. The procedure duration ( 74 ± 17 versus 120 ± 49 minutes p < 0.05 ) was shorter for CB2. The rate of successful ablation was achieved in 98 vs. 93 % patients in the cryoballoon and RF ablation, respectively. Follow-up with Holter monitoring was performed.. The time-course patterns were comparable between the groups for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) value ( P = 0.804 ) and PVs isolated ( 1.5 ± 1.4 versus 1.6 ± 1 ). During the same time period, the rate of patients without AF recurrence and free of antiarrhythmic drug at 12-month follow-up was similar ( cryoablation 44.2 % and RF 41.4 %, P =.25 ). A significant improvement of quality of life ( QoL ) and the duration of AF ablation was observed in both groups ( 6.7 % versus 67 %, p = 0.001 ). Patients undergoing RF ablation were more common after cryoablation, with a systematic stepwise mapping approach, but not the RF ablation ( P= 0.001 )."
30397494," OBJECTIVE To evaluate and vali date appropriate premeal insulin dose reductions for postpr and ial exercises of different intensities and duration s to minimize the risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Eight healthy individuals with type I diabetes were tested on two separate occasions, during which either a 30-min MOD or IHE protocol was performed... MOD consisted of continuous exercise at 40 % Vo(2peak ), while the SCORE protocol involved a combination of continuous work at 40 ° Vo(twopeak ) and moderate-intensity exercise ( MOD ) in r and om order. Patients were r and Omly assigned to 30 min intense exercise ( 65 % peak oxygen uptake [ Vo( 2peak ) ) ), or 0 g of glucose preexercise but performed brief high-intensity intervals interspersed every 2 min ( 0 G + MOD/INT ). During exercise, BG, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, cortisol, glucagon, and insulin-like growth factor-1, blood lactate, heart rate, and gas exchange variables were measured. For 60 min of recovery from exercise, glucose levels remained higher in IHE compared with MOD ( P < 0.05 ). Furthermore, the plasma glucose was significantly smaller for B ( p = 0.024 ) and tended to be smaller for A and C compared to CON. No differences were found for post-exercise interstitial glucose, acute hormone response, and carbohydrate utilization between HIIE and CON for A, B, and C. The health benefits of physical exercise in this condition are many, but more than 60 % do not participate, mainly from fear of hypoglycemic. This systematic review explores the effects of exercise modes on blood glucose levels in adults with the two occasions ( DeltaAUC insulin : -2.1 + /- 3.9 vs. 1.5 +/- 6.2 pmol. l(-1 ). h(-1 )."
32242450," OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy and safety of fluoxetine in children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ).. The efficacy of fluoxetine was compared with placebo in children with OCD, placebo-controlled, and there is a small body of evidence indicating that fluoxetine may be effective in this group. The study consisted of a 6-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of fluoxetine or placebo in pediatric and adolescent OCD. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline in the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale ( CY-BOCS ). Subjects who had not responded after 6 weeks could have their dosage increased by 20 mg daily, for a maximum possible dosage of 60 mg daily. The  L-5-HTP – induced cortisol and PRL responses were significantly higher in fluoxetine-treated than in tricyclic-treated or unmedicated major depressed patients. The latter two groups did not differ significantly in their cortisol or PRL responses to fluoxetine. CONCLUSIONS Fluoxetine was associated with significantly greater improvement in OCD as assessed by the CY- BOCS ( p =.026 ) and other measures than was placebo. The adjusted mean difference, -3.45 in favor of fluoxetine compared to placebo, was statistically significant ( 95 % confidence interval=-5.60 to -1.29, p=.002 ). The most common drug side effects were mild to moderate in intensity. A total of 10.2 % ( 10/98 ) of fluoxetine treated OCD patients were not significant ( P =.14, d = 0.34 ) ; however, a numerical trend toward significant between-group differences was found to the treatment of OCD in children & adolescents. As a result, a systematic review, which is a more powerful method to calculate the effect size, those studies had small sample sizes..

27820540," Background and Purpose — The effectiveness of a treadmill and overground walking program for the secondary prevention of stroke survivors. The objective of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of an 8-week supervised strengthening and conditioning program ( supervised ) with those who did not receive treatment ( waiting-list controls )  in five urban communities. Methods : A comprehensive literature search was undertaken to identify the outcomes of a single-blind RCT of a 12-week program versus usual care. The participants were 155 elderly stroke survivors who were admitted to a geriatric rehabilitation department. Stratified r and om sampling generated intervention and control groups. The intervention was design ed to work together with the routine rehabilitation program. The primary outcome was walking speed over 6 minutes, and secondary outcome measures were Human Activity Profile, Medical Outcome Study 36-Item Short-Form survey ( SF-36 ), and functional capacity. The group difference was significant, and remained so when age, sex, disability and sBP at discharge were accounted for ( p = 0.04 ). Baseline and postintervention assessment s included the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment ( 14.0 points ; P=0.007 ) and the Lawton Scale of Instrumental ADL. The mean age was 72 ( range, 37 to 95 ). These deficits were found to be addressed by those providing care for stroke patients in order to improve patient satisfaction. Conclusion : Through an integrated system of education, the intervention was effective in improving mobility, functional capacity, and balance, and therefore should decrease the likelihood or recurrent stroke or vascular event. The secondary prevention behavioural interventions, which address one or more modifiable lifestyle risk factors for recurrent stroke, tobacco use, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol consumption."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and activity of a geriatric assessment tool in the oncology setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients age ≥ 65 years with cancer, who enrolled on cooperative group cancer trials, were eligible to enroll on Cancer and Leukemia Group B ( CALGB ). Patients were prospect ively recruited in an observational trial. The clinical behaviour of common malignant diseases, e.g. breast, ovarian and lung cancers, lymphomas and acute leukaemias, was evaluated. Overall, the rate of complete remission was 70 % ( p = 0.466 ). Pretreatment CGA and mini geriatric assessment ( GA ), time to first progression ( TTP1 ) and safety were secondary endpoints. RESULTS : Between July 2006 and November 2008, 22 patients ( 46 % ) were enrolled. The median age was 73 years ( range, 65 to 91 years ). The number of QoL responders ( CG arm, 12 % ; CP arm, 5 % ) was not significantly different. Overall R-CHOP and R-miniCEOP are similarly effective for elderly “ fit” patients with DLBCL.

27820577," The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of providing a telehealth intervention to patients with heart failure, to improve clinical outcomes and self-management behaviors.  Patients were recruited from 10 home health agencies ( HHAs ) across the United States. We used a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based intervention ( telephonic, home visit ) on outcomes of heart failure patients in the home. Patients at a Midwestern Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center were r and omized to telephone, videophone, or usual care for 6 months. The study participants were either eliminated prior to or withdrawn after enrollment from the study based on Health Buddy ® issues. In-person visits were more than 3 times longer than telenursing visits ( p < 0.0001 ), only partially due to added travel time. Patient self-care adherence, medications, health status, and satisfaction did not significantly differ between groups.. Telehealth interventions following hospital discharge in various setting s have been reported to decrease mortality, rehospitalization, and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS This pilot study demonstrates that RM can be successfully implemented in non-homebound HF patients and may reduce readmission rates.. The median age of the cohort was 59 + /- 15 years and 68 % were male. The population had similar baseline characteristics and outcomes. Congestive heart failure results in clinical signs of edema, shortness of breath, and decreased quality of Life."
29478018," OBJECTIVE To examine whether adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease and cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING This is a multi-centre cohort study.. The aim of this study was to assess whether Mediterranean diet influences both C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and adiponectin in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. The sample included 1587 males and 2260 females. MDP was defined “ a priori ” by summing the st and ardized residuals of nutrients and foods after adjusting for the other three sites : Pan Yu, 58 men, 95 women ; San Francisco, 166 men, 192 women ; Sydney, 95 men, 73 women.. Method : Food-frequency question naire over a 7 week period. A high/healthy score was taken as ≥4 for men and ≥3 for women. At baseline visit and at 1 year, body weight, HOMA index, CRP, and adipocectin and its fractions were assessed. A higher degree of adherence than the lowest Mediterranean diet score, even after adjustment for relevant confounders ( P < 0.01 ). In comparing the four geographical regions, the participants in the highest tertile of the diet score had, on average, 19 % lower odds of death from CVD ( HR 0·66 ; 95 % CI 0·49, 0·89 ). The percentage of those with a high score in all sites was greater than among elderly Greeks consuming a more traditional heart-healthy Mediterranean diet. Conclusion : Considerable variations in Chinese dietary patterns exist with respect to age, gender and geographic location. Overall, there is evidence to support the notion that Mediterranean diet, which is generally recognized as a healthy diet, appears restricted to older people and to rural areas, whereas urbanized young people depart from it."
25939649," BACKGROUND The use of digoxin is recommended for patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF ). The study reported that digoxin may decrease overall mortality among patients with heart failure and depressed left ventricular systolic function. We studied the effect of digoxin on mortality and hospitalization in a "" real world"" study of patients with AF, the incidence of digoxin treatment for AF, and the relationship between digoxin use and mortality. In the current study, we examined the impact of digoxin ( placebo group, n = 46 ) or the presence of heart failure. The main outcome was the primary outcome of the study. We also performed a sub- analysis considering only cardiovascular ( CV ) deaths. The patients were r and omly assigned to digoxin or placebo. Of the 614 patients, 212 ( 27.28 % ) received digoxin as initial therapy and 1329 received no digoxin at baseline. The outcome measures were compared between digoxin and placebo. The digoxin group had a higher mortality than those without, patients on digoxin ( HR = 2.0, CI 1.7 to 2.5 ), treatment in an internal medicine ward ( hazard ratio ( HR ) = 1.58, 95 % confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.94 ). There was no difference in mortality between the digoxin group and placebo group ( p = 0.99 ). Among the patients with digoxin use, the mortality was not associated with a greater risk for all-cause mortality ( HR : 0.92 ; 95 % CI, 0,62 - 1.9 ; P=.4 ).. There were no differences in mortality ( AKI, AKI, and mortality ), nor in the group with AF...

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of catheter ablation in patients with AF. We sought to identify the patient, procedural, and follow-up factors associated with arrhythmia recurrences after AF. METHODS AND RESULTS In this retrospective study, 200 patients ( 75.5 % male, 57.8 ± 11.6 years old, 68.8 % paroxysmal AF ) who underwent RFCA.  We analyzed preprocedural sinus rhythm ECGs obtained in the absence of antiarrhythmic drug, and all enrolled patients were categorized into 4 groups based on the quartile values of the PR interval ( 166, 182, and 202 ms ), and were analyzed according to the left atrium ( LA ) volume ( CT ; Computed tomography ), LA voltage ( NavX )... The univariate predictors of AFR were : type of AF ( non-PAF vs. PAF, P=0.001 ), normalized left atrium area ( NLA ≥10.25 vs. NLA < 10.25, P = 0.012 ). A Cox regression analysis showed that the baseline AF ( per month, hazard ratio [ HR ] 1.003, 95 % CI 1.001 - 1.006 ), the AF recurrence. The receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated a BMI cut point of 22.1 kg/m(2 ), with an area under the curve of 0.773.. In the first redo procedure, patients with rhythm control treatments ( P<0.0001 ) and AF progression. The more common factors have been used to formulate risk stratification scores, to help predict the outcomes of rhythm control or arrhythmmia progression.

The participants were divided into two groups of 33 women with postmenopausal bone loss, the control group and 2 supplementation groups which were given either placebo or 1 g of calcium/day for two years. The bone mineral content of the femur was determined before and after the intervention. The study was conducted in a 2-year multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in women who were living independently and were consuming < 1 g/day of calcium. The differences in net percentage changes ( calcium group minus placebo group ) in bone density were -3.53 + /- 1.24 % ( placebo ), and the mean bone loss was not without controversy ( Kanis 1989 ; Nordin 1990 ). The mean bone mineral density ( BMD ) was measured every six months by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The difference between the three groups was significant ( p = 0.023, chi2 ).. The percentage change in BMD in the lumbar spine ( the distal forearm and spine ) was not the same as the placebo group. The placebo group had the lowest BMD. The BMD at lumbar spine, -2.12+/-4.06 and + 1.22 +/- 4.25 percent ( P=0.02 ). the BMD at the calcium tablets or the milk powder group was similar to placebo. The group had a three-arm, r and omized, parallel design. The calcium supplementation was not significant at all skeletal sites after one year, but the difference was significant only for total-body bone loss.

19370677," A placebo-controlled crossover design, with each treatment period lasting 6 weeks, was used to investigate effects of dronabinol in 15 patients with a diagnosis of probable Alzhemer's disease who were refusing food. The 6-item  Philadelphia Geriatric Center Affect Rating Scale was design ed for the use of research and other staff in assessing positive affect ( pleasure, interest, contentment ) and negative affect ( sadness, worry/anxiety, and anger ) by direct observation of facial expression, body movement, and other cues that do not depend on self-report, among 253 demented and 43 nondemented residents. Each affect scale was highly reliable, expressed in estimated portions of a 10-minute observation period when the affect expression occurred. Validity estimates were affirmative in showing discriminant correlations between the positive states and various independent measures of social and other outwardly engaged behavior and between negative states and other measures of depression, anger, anxiety, and withdrawal. Limited support for  the two-factor dimensionality of the cannabinoid system was obtained, although positive and Negative affect were correlated, rather than independent. Some hope is offered that the preference and aversions of Alzheimer patients may be better understood by observations of their emotional behaviors and that such methods may lead to a better ability to judge institutional quality. BACKGROUND: BACKGROUND Following the discovery of an endogenous cannabinoid system and the identification of specific cannabinoid receptors in the central nervous system, much work has been done to understand the main effects of these compounds. There is increasing evidence that some cannabinoid system may regulate neurodegenerative processes such as excessive glutamate production, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Neurodegeneration is a feature common to the various types of dementia and this has led to interest in whether cannabinoids may be clinical ly useful in treating the cognitive dysfunction of people with dementia. Recent studies have also shown that cannabinoids may have more specific effects in interrupting the pathological process in Alzheimer ;s disease. OBJECTIVES To determine from available research whether cannabinoids are clinical ly effective in treatment of dementia."

In the present study, we aim ed to compare the effects of ramipril versus placebo on these risks in type 2 diabetes. We used a r and omised controlled trial comparing the outcomes of ramipril ( 1.25 mg/day ) with placebo ( on top of usual treatment ) for patients with diabetes. The study was conducted in the United Kingdom. Patients with diabetes, who were not taking ACE inhibitors, were included to receive either ramipril ( 10 mg once a day ) or placebo. We compared the groups with regard to the time to a primary endpoint of any complications or deaths related to diabetes and all cause mortality. The secondary aggregate outcomes : myocardial infa rct ion, stroke, and death from any cause. In I‐SHARP, target BP⩽135/85 mmHg, as recommended by the Swiss Society of Hypertension, was the goal for 25 % of patients for diabetes, 28 % ( 95 % CI 16–39 % ). During the 5-year follow-up period, no difference was observed between intensive versus moderate blood pressure, except for cataract extraction.. In each group, the incidence of any adverse event was lower than the baseline value ( p=0.02 ). In both groups, there was no difference in mortality... The primary endpoint was not significantly different between the captopril group and the placebo group ( p = 0.33 ). The other endpoints included the renal function.

27071989," Objective : The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between concussion severity and cognitive performance in collegiate athletes. Several studies using traditional neuropsychological measures have found a relationship between a previous history of concussion and reduced cognitive abilities. This new classification system is binary ( ie, “ simple ” versus “ complex ” concussions ). In the present study, we examined the association between a self-reported concussion history and neurocognitive performance and symptoms between 48 male collegiate athletes who had sustained concussion and who were divided into two groups : those reporting concussion. The Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Test ( ImPACT ) and a subgroup of athletes also were assessed with 7 measures from a neuropsychological test battery. Results : Few cognitive differences were found between the athlete groups at the baseline or postseason assessment s. On univariate analyses, the majority of the concussion survivors demonstrated significantly higher levels of depression from baseline at 2 days ( P≤.001 ), 7 days  ( P=.006 ), and 14 days postconcussion. There were no significant group differences on baseline or post-concussion verbal memory, visual memory, reaction time, and total reported symptoms. On 2 postseason cognitive measures, there were no sex differences in depression levels. The addition of neurocognitive testing at 14 days was significantly associated with the odds of suffering prolonged symptoms. Conclusion The immediate post concussion assessment and cognitive testing tool was not predictive of concussion. Given the validity of concussion diagnosis, the current study suggests that the following:.. The impact of concussion testing is unclear to the extent that it can be used to support the clinical practice.. Background The Immediate post concussion Assessment & Cognitive Testing test covered all aspects of validity ( e.g., cognitive performance and the vestibular ratio ) to predict the occurrence of concussion in the ImPAC test, thusA.})."

We preformed a prospect i ve collection of data covering the perinatal period until discharge from the SEN1500 network. This network, set up by the Spanish Society of Neonatology, targets VLBW and ELBW infants ( 400 to 1500 g ).. Feeding was initiated within 30 hours of birth. Daily enteral and parenteral volumes, caloric and protein intakes, growth, enteral intolerance, and clinical complications were recorded. Cox regression analysis was used to determine primary outcome, the time to achieve full enteral feeding. RESULTS The continuously fed infants achieved full enteral feeds significantly faster than the intermittently fed infants ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = 1.86 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] =1.07 to 3.22 ). In stratified analysis according to birth weight,  the improvement was even more pronounced in infants under a postmenstrual age of 26 weeks. Hyaline membrane disease was diagnosed in 53.9 % of the newborns and bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) in 10.46 %.  Mechanical ventilation  was employed in 69.1 %, surfactant in 50.3 %, and steroids for BPD.

The study was designed to test the feasibility of an in-home early recovery management intervention to improve physical and psychosocial functioning in the hospital. The intervention began at discharge ; those receiving an audiotape of information on expected physical sensations and their management ( Cardiac Home Information Program [ CHIP ] ) were r and omly assigned to either an experimental or a control group. The effect of the intervention, which was implemented by a cardiac rehabilitation nurse specialist, was assessed by a knowledge test and a state anxiety inventory. RESULTS Although no statistical differences between groups were found, the treatment group had significantly lower than the control group at day 2 at home.. A more sustained decrease in anxiety, self-care behaviour, readmissions, and hospital readmission rates were observed. The impact of these interventions on the rate of readmission, performance of specific health behaviours, depression, anxiety, and cognition during the post-hospital discharge recovery period. CONCLUSIONS A significant difference was found in terms of total energy expenditure ( F ( 2, 231 ) = 131, p < 0.001 ), and the need for a more focused, directive intervention.. The effectiveness of individualized patient education interventions to st and ardized patients on improving the quality of life. The incidence of readmissions was significantly higher than controls.

22889860," This experimental, r and omized controlled study was conducted for children with cancer who are 7 to 12 years of age and receiving chemotherapy treatment to detect the impact of appropriate nursing interventions on decreasing the fatigue syndrome. The objective of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of a revised Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale ( MSAS ) in patients aged 7 - 12 as an instrument for the assessment of symptoms in young children and adolescents with cancer. The MSAS ( 7 -12 ) was administered to 149 children ( in patients and out patients ) who were undergoing treatment at either the Royal Marsden NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom or The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia. The findings illustrate the significant impact of chemotherapy-related fatigue in children and adolescent. A factor analysis of variance yielded two factors that distinguished three major symptom groups and several subgroups. The major groups comprised psychological symptoms ( PSYCH ), high prevalence physical symptoms ( PHYS H ), and low prevalence mental symptoms ( P <.00 ). The main findings from the study are that patients have more problems with fatigue in the first few days after the start of a cycle of chemotherapy.. Corticosteroid use and haemoglobin value were associated with significant increases in fatigue that were sustained for several days and reached the highest level of fatigue at day 5 for those receiving concurrent steroids. The association of chemotherapeutic agents with fatigue varied between patient self-report and parent report, but the majority of the instrument used to measure fatigue was not associated with most changes in fatigue."

19821358," OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of the probiotic lactobacilli in the management of bacterial vaginosis ( BV ). The study included women with vaginal discharge and the vaginal flora, as well as c and idal vaginitis , we design ed a crossover trial during which patients were examined monthly for their vaginal microbiota and their use of probiotics.  Treatment with probiotics was quite effective, but recurrences are common. A total of 55 vaginal sample s from 11 women with BV. The use of probiotic lactobacilli for the treatment of BV... The majority of women with vaginosis were treated with oral or vaginal application of lactobacilli twice daily. The result was favorable indicating that the continuous correction of vaginal pH and lactobaccillus flora is crucial for normal vaginal ecology. The number of lactobacilli was significantly related to vaginal colonization ( p<0.001 ) and to the rate of early pregnancy loss. The results showed that lactobacilli in healthy vaginal mucosa were significantly higher than in BV, while the bacteria were significantly lower. The presence of lactobacilli in vagina was not associated with the eradication of BV, and therefore the use of lactobacilli-containing tampons. The eradication of lactobacilli from vagina was the least specific and treatment with lactobacilli-treated subjects compared to placebo tape. The association of lactobacilli with this condition was significant and thatA. The study showed the efficacy of probiotic treatment."

25572192," OBJECTIVE : To compare the efficacy of intravenous ( IV ) iron administration to oral iron in treating anemia in patients with chemotherapy-associated anemia ( CAA ). In a r and omized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, 90 premenopausal women with hemoglobin levels between 8 and 10.5 g/dL and ferritin values less than 13 & mgr;g/L received either oral iron sucrose ( 200 mg ) or intravenous iron sucrose. The iron sucrose dose was calculated from the following formula : weight before pregnancy ( kg ) × ( 110 g/L ) - actual hemoglobin ( Hb ). Transfusions of red blood cells and transferrin saturation ( TSAT ) were assessed at baseline and then again after 2 weeks. The intravenous iron group had higher increases in Hb ( 3.0 vs. 0.8 g/dl ; p < 0.0001 ). The mean increase in Hb was significantly higher in the iron group compared to the oral iron group ( p<0.05 ), and the change in Hb values was also higher in patients receiving intravenous iron compared with control subjects ( P = 0.0028 ). No serious adverse drug reactions were observed. In addition, the mean platelet count was significantly increased in patients ( 95 % CI, 59.1 % to 74.0 % ). Treatment with intravenous iron but not oral iron was also associated with decreased plasma ascorbate and alpha-tocopherol levels and increased oxidized glutathione/reduced glutathione ratio. In conclusion, intravenous iron preparations can provide a true balance of efficacy and safety."

The aim of this study was to obtain consensus among experts about the effects of testosterone gel ( 1.62 % ) on serum testosterone, total and free T, and body composition. The invited participants were randomized to receive either placebo ( n = 20 ) or testosterone enanthate ( TRT ). At baseline, there were no significant differences between the T group and placebo group. In men receiving T gel, circulating total T and estradiol ( E(2 ) ) were significantly raised compared with baseline, and a significant improvement in verbal memory was observed. For men receiving DHT gel, serum DHT levels increased and T levels decreased significantly compared with placebo. The main outcome variables were serum total, free T, dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ), and prostate-specific antigen < 2.5 ng/mL. The initial item pool of 206 patients was reduced to 9 items in three Delphi rounds. The final criteria list ( the Delphi list ) was not an inclusion criterion. We obtained serial measurements of BMD of the lumbar spine and hip by using the same method. At 3 months, the mean testosterone level was higher in the placebo group ( from 266±25 seconds at baseline to 284±23 seconds after 4 weeks and to 292±24 seconds after 12 weeks.

However, the additional influence of neurofeedback over treatment as usual ( TAU ) on neurocognitive functioning for children with ADHD. The current study examined the potential additive effect of neurofeedback to ( 1 ) optimally titrated methylpheni date and ( 2 ) a semi-active control group - during resting and active ( effortful ) task conditions to determine whether NF can induce sustained alterations in brain function. METHODS Using a multicentre three-way parallel group RCT design, 112 children with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of ADHD, aged 7 - 13 years, were initially included. NF training consisted of 30 sessions of theta/beta training at Cz, and 30 in a group that received methylphenidate ( MPH ). The neurofeedback intervention consisted of approximately 37 sessions over a period of 25 weeks, and the placebo group. The PA intervention was matched in frequency and duration to NFB.  ADHD core symptoms were recorded pre-/post-treatment, using parents ’ and teachers ’ forms taken from Barkley ’s Defiant Children. The combined therapy was especially suitable for children and adolescents with ADHD, that had to be moved up into space. A transfer session without feedback tested learning retention as a proximal measure of transfer to everyday life. RESULTS Analysis of covariance revealed a significant difference between the groups at evaluation in favor of neurofeedback, and for the parent/self-report difference ( 0.21 ± 0.04, p <.0001, d =.60 ). In addition the group targeting rIFG, however, showed a transfer effect, which correlated to ADHD symptom reductions, to PA ( ηp ( 2 )) =.07...

26793356," Background Antihypertensive drugs are used to control blood pressure ( BP ) and reduce cardiovascular disease. The authors hypothesized that blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor with an angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) could improve arterial stiffness, which has been translated into improved outcome. Methods : One-hundred and fifty-six subjects with hypertension were enrolled and r and omized to treatment with either irbesartan or atenolol.  The present study was conducted to compare the effects of valsartan ( n=66 ), an ARB, with that of amlodipine ( n = 65 ). At baseline and 6 months after the treatment, 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring, echocardiography , and measurement of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity ( baPWV ) were performed. Results : After the 6 months of treatment. The patients were divided into two groups.. Arterial stiffness was reduced ( p<0.01 ) from 145±4/101±2 and 147±6/98±2 to 128±4/-11.7 mm Hg for amlodipine, respectively. The mean age of patients in both groups was similar ( amlodipine group : 54.9 ± 4.5 years ; P = not significant ) and the mean arterial pressure ( AP ) was unaffected by treatment.. The ARB group showed the largest reductions in PP and brachial and central BP, and in augmentation index ( −2.1 ± 0.8 mmHg ), while the L-type Ca channel blocker yielded no improvement. The results of our study showed that ARB treatment was associated with the greatest reductions in central aortic BP and vascular endothelial function, and at least partially with a decrease in BP variability in hypertensive patients."
26358358," BACKGROUND Both nutritional and genetic factors are involved in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. We compared the effects of high-fructose and matched glucose intake on hepatic triacylglycerol ( TAG ) concentration and other liver parameters. The study was done in a double-blind study, we r and omly assigned 32 healthy but central ly overweight men to groups that received either a high-fat or high-glucose diet ( 25 % energy ). These diets were provided during an initial isocaloric period of 2 weeks, followed by a 6-week washout period, and then again during a hypercaloric 2-week period. The primary outcome measure was hepatic level of TAG, with additional assessment s of TAG levels in serum and soleus muscle, and high sucrose ( HS ). Fasting hepatic glucose output ( HGO ) was measured with 6,6 - 2H2-glucose. The results indicate that in a diet high in saturated fatty acids and cholesterol, fructose increases the levels of lipid targets, especially in hyperinsulinemic men. To up date the evidence on the role of fructose in mediating  cardiovascular disease ( low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL]-C, apolipoprotein B, triglycerides, P < 0.001 ) and the control diet ( from 10.3 + /- 0.5 %, P = 0.11 ). The high-frequency diet also produced an increase of 0.8 ± 0.9 in  total cholesterol, and HDL-C.

In a multicenter, prospect i ve, open-label study, children with ADHD Combined Type, aged 7 to 9.9 years, were assigned to receive either methylphenidate, methylphenidate, or placebo. The authors present the case for psychiatry's adoption of the practical clinical trials model, which is widely used in research in other areas of medicine. METHODS We reconducted r and om-effects regression ( RR ) analyses, adding factors defined by moderators ( sex,  prior medication use ,  comorbid disruptive or anxiety disorder , and public assistance ). Outcomes were assessed in multiple domains before and during treatment and at treatment end point ( with the majority of children and adolescents receiving methylphenidate.. In total, 1323 patients received OROS MPH ( n=850 ) or placebo, and the possible superiority of Beh over CC on 5 effectiveness and 4 service use domains. RESULTS The MTA medication strategy showed persisting significant superiority over Beh and CC for ADHD and oppositional-defiant symptoms. For those with anxiety disorders, however, behavioral treatment yielded significantly better outcomes than community care ( and was no longer statistically different from medication management and combined treatment ).. The groups differed significantly in mean dose ( methylpheni date equivalents 30.4, 37.5, 25.7, and 24.0 mg/day, respectively ). The dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day was associated with intermediate efficacy between placebo and both the 2 higher doses, suggesting a grade d dose-response. The present analysis addresses NICE's appraisal of methylphenidate, atomoxetine and dual-drug treatment of ADHD."
28492950," The total concentration of THC, a major active constituent of cannabis, is attracting growing attention in medicine for its anxiolytic, antipsychotic, antiemetic and anti-inflammatory properties. The level of the main psychoactive compound, Δ 9 ‐tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ), is measured in marijuana and hashish. In contrast with imported marijuana, Nederwiet hardly contained any cannabidiol ( CBD ). To be able to perform suitable exposure risk analysis, it is important to know if there is a linear relation between THC. In a 3-day, double-blind, within-subject laboratory study was to assess the influence of CBD ( 0, 200, 400, 800 mg, p.o. ). During successive bouts, participants smoked 0, 3, 6, 9 and 18 % THC. Participants smoked four cannabis cigarettes containing 0, 29.3, 49.1 and 69.4 mg THC.. Non-treatment-seeking, healthy cannabis smokers ( n=31 ; 17 M, 14 F ) completed eight outpatient sessions..

29684790," Study Design. A prospect i ve study was conducted on a group of patients with unilateral nonspecific low back pain ( LBP ) and healthy controls. This study aim ed to determine whether an adaptation of the Roman chair exercise would induce more fatigue in back muscles than in hip extensors. An experimental study was design ed that tested the lumbar spine and hip joint kinematics and coordination in subjects with and without sub-acute lumbar back pain.. The purpose of this study was to compare the amplitude and timing of spinal and hip  motions  during two, seated reaching activities in people with or without a history of recurrent low back Pain ( RLBP ). Analysis using the Student's t-test revealed significant differences for hip joint range of motion, stride time, and the linear regression coefficients between these deviations calculated. The ranges of motions of lumbar spine, thirteen obese subjects with cLBP, and eleven healthy subjects were enrolled. Results. Pelvic asymmetry was characterized in terms of relative Fourier phase, and coupling strength was assessed by means of cross-spectral analysis. A change of muscle activation pattern was emphasized throughout the exercise bout, with some lower back muscles showing an increase followed by a decrease or leveling off of activation. The lumbar region displayed no significant between-group differences. The order in which the spinal segments achieved peak velocity in cross-reaching was reversed in RLBP compared to controls.. Most power of segmental residual rotations was below stride frequency ( ~1 Hz ). In this frequency range, trunk residual rotations had less power than pelvis or thorax residual rotations.Conclusion : Currently, there is a widespread reliance on self‐reported question naires to assess low back back pain patients. The aim of these study is to systematic ally review which kinematic /kinetic parameters have been used to assist clinical assessment."
29760482," BACKGROUND Oral glucose has been shown to decrease the energy density of foods with the intention of affecting weight loss or weight maintenance. In this study, subjects ( n 26 ) completed four experimental sessions ( in counterbalanced order and after an initial practice session ) during which they were given a 500 ml drink 30 min prior to completing a cognitive assessment battery. We evaluated the effects of a low-energy d-xylose preload, with or without sitagliptin, on glucose, tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 and von Willebr and factor ( vWF ). The taste stimuli were not swallowed.. The subjects were studied on four separate occasions each. A preload drink containing 40 g glucose, 40 g tagatose/isomalt mixture ( TIM ), and a 75-g glucose load. We tested the intra-individual variability with respect to fasting status. Blood glucose and insulin concentrations were measured every 15 min within the first hour of preload consumption and every 30 min for the subsequent 2 h. In conclusion, the current data suggest that the sweeteners sucrose and saccharin activate a CPIR, but that a moderate dose ( 100 mg/kg ) was associated with greater than placebo. The primary outcome was the proportion of individuals consuming one or more foods, beverages, or packets containing carbohydrates. The overall postpr and ial GLP-1 response was greater after glucose, 3OMG, and TIM than after sucralose ( P = 0.05 ). Conclusion / objectives Nonnutritive sweeteners ( NNSs ) are zero- or low-calorie alternatives to nutritive sweeteners, such as table sugars. A systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials was conducted to quantitatively synthesize existing scientific evidence on the glycemic impact of NNSs."
31266163," OBJECTIVES To evaluate the clinical success of a self-adhesive resin cement to the hybridized dentin with different bonding systems. Material and Methods Fifty-six healthy human third molars were prepared for full-coverage crowns. 20 zirconia copings were made ( LAVA, 3 M ESPE ) and cemented. In 121 patients were r and omly divided into 7 experimental groups ( veneer preparation/resin composite veneer placement/endodontic therapy, RelyX Unicem ( P ), and Maxcem ® ( E ) ) and immersed in 10 % safranin for 72 hours. Shear bond strength measurements were obtained before and after thermocycling. At baseline, 6 months, and 1, 2, and 4 years after placement, the restorations were assessed by two calibrated investigators using modified USPHS criteria. Ten selected sample s of each group were evaluated at BL and 24 months after placement. The restorations were evaluated the bonding of 2 ceramic systems, Ceramco II ( Group I ) and IPS Empress 2 ( Group II ). The presence of a liner or base of glass-ionomer cement result ed in a risk for failure twice as large as that of restorations without adhesive systems. The mean observation period of the adhesive systems ( 2-step etch- and -rinse and 1-step self-etch ). No significant differences were observed between the group s were observed for marginal adaptation and marginal discoloration.. The adhesive systems were not significantly related to microleakage. For RXU + E, adhesive systems are continuously introduced to be used by clinicians. Different technologies are changing the therapeutical options to do indirect restorations. In Groups I A and II A. The bonding system was applied immediately after the restoration and the composite system was used to achieve the best results. The adhesive system was found to have the highest adhesive system, followed by BisCem ( 5.1-A.) . The composite system can be used for the indirect restorations  on the dental tissues."

Design : Two groups ; parallel design ; prospect i ve, r and omized controlled trial. Setting : Postural control laboratory, arenas, September 2001 to December 2002. Participants : Forty-four young adult soccer players ( 61 girls and 242 boys ). They had played h and ball for 14.9 ( ±3.2 ) years, 4.7 ( ±2.8 ) years at the top level. The three-dimensional movements of the platform versus the ground were documented weekly by using a computerized optoelectronic digitiser. The experimental subjects showed significant improvements in both the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior parameters of postural sway when compared with a control group. The study was repeated by independent raters to create a second set of individual and consensus ratings. The subjects were instructed in the program and supplied with an instructional video, poster, six balance mats, and six wobble boards. The results showed that the group using the intervention program had a significantly higher number of traumatic injuries ( 16 vs. 6 ). The duration of each training session was approximately 15 minutes. There are several studies that have evaluated the ability of balance training to improve balance ability in a healthy population.. The balance program decreased the numbers of both traumatic and overuse injuries. The differences in balance ability between the groups were significant during the first intervention season ( OR, 0.87 ; CI.50–1.52 ; p = 0.62 ). There was a significant improvement in dynamic balance between test 1 and test 2.. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the impact of balance rehabilitation on improving balance ability among the healthy population with no general consensus...A).}) }."

31763928," BACKGROUND Although modifiable cardiovascular disease risk factors are common, some patients eschew conventional drug treatments in favor of natural alternatives. Pycnogenol is a proprietary bark extract of the French maritime pine tree ( Pinus pinaster ssp. atlantica ) that exerts antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-platelet effects. METHODS Pycnotogenol ®, 100mg/day, was used as a supplement for 8 weeks by a group of 60 women. A comparable group of 35 women with identical cardiometabolic risk factors was included as the control group. All women were instructed to participate in a best management plan of menopause. The cognitive tasks comprised measures of attention, working memory, episodic memory, and psychomotor performance. The biological measures comprised levels of clinical hepatic enzymes, serum lipid profile, human growth hormone, and lipid peroxidation products. Statistically significant interactions were found for memory-based cognitive variables and lipid peroxides.. Baseline characteristics did not differ between the study groups. Over the 12-week intervention, the sum of systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 1.0 mm Hg ( 95 % confidence interval, -4.2 to 2.1 mm Hg ) in the pine bark extract-treated group compared to the placebo group ( P =.05 ). In CAD  patients, Pycnidogenol, but not placebo, augmented FBF response to ACh, from 13.1±7.0 to 18.5±4.0 mL/min per 100 mL tissue ( p<0.05 ). SNP-stimulated vasodilation was similar before and after 2 weeks of treatment. The supplementation with PycNogenol® improved the quality of life of perimenopausal women and normalized a series of cardiorenal risk factors.."
29350873," Background : Pain responses to 2 types of preoperative heat stimuli were not independent clinical ly relevant predictors for postoperative pain after total knee arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a Mulligan's mobilization with movement ( MWM ) technique improves talocrural dorsiflexion, a major impairment following ankle sprain, and relieves pain in subacute population s. Methods : Patients with severe pain with a simple knee range-of-motion test prior to TKA had a 10 times higher likelihood of moderate to severe pain at 6 months. A total of 25 consecutive patients meeting inclusion criteria completed a  pain diagram  before undergoing the intradiscal electrothermal annuloplasty procedure.  The location, intensity, and familiarity of any pain provoked during disc heating were correlated with presenting symptoms and duration of heating. Results. During disc heating, 68 % of patients reported exact reproduction of their presenting pain, in both pain quality and location... The pattern of pain reproduction was consistent ; pain originated proximally and progressed distally as stimulus intensity increased. The ICC for pain threshold was the only consistent predictor for both groups ( Kappa<0.6 ). Intraobserver reproducibility for both height and weight, and PPT ( time until removal of the h and from the water ) were measured six times over a 3-h period, subsequent to the administration of each medication. The mean IO‐R ( r = 0.83 ) to be used in clinical practice. The interobserver agreement for all outcome measures was good, but systematic differences in assessment between the physiotherapists were found in individuals with peripheral joint pain ( PJP ). CONCLUSIONS : Examination of muscle strength and PPTs in knee OA is important to help identify patients at risk of poorer outcomes and might provide direction for future research into mechanism-based treatment approaches for these patients."
25631639," BACKGROUND BACKGROUND Decreased 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25(OH)D ] concentrations have been associated with an increased prevalence and severity of asthma and a lower response to inhaled corticosteroids. OBJECTIVE The objective was to investigate the cross-sectional and prospect i ve associations between serum vitamin D levels and subsequent severe asthma exacerbations. A total of 466 ( 78 % ) children were examined at birth, 440 ( 74 % ) at age 9 months and 178 ( 30 % ) At age 9 years. In addition to the treatment as per GINA guidelines, one group received oral vitamin D3 ( Cholecalciferol ) 60,000 IU per month for 6 mo and the other group received placebo powder in the form of glucose sachet with a double blinded design. Monthly follow up of every patient was done and during every visit change in severity, level of control, Peak expiratory flow rate ( PEFR ), steroid dosage, number of exacerbations and number of emergency visits were assessed. Results : There were no associations between maternal vitamin D concentrations and  the child's body size or measures of the Child's intelligence, psychological health or cardiovascular system. Monthly doses of vitamin D significantly reduced the requirement of steroids ( p = 0.013 ) and emergency visits ( p= 0.015 ). Control of asthma was achieved earlier in patients who received monthly vitamin D ( OR 5.40, 95 % CI, 1.1 - 26.65, P=0.038 ). CONCLUSION Vitamin D insufficiency is common in this population of North American children with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma and is associated with higher odds of severe exacerbation over a 4-year period. The primary outcome was time to first asthma treatment failure ( a composite outcome of decline in lung function and increases in use of β-agonists, systemic corticosterones, and health care ). The associations between vitamin D deficiency and asthma were age-dependent. The study was supported by the high prevalence of asthma incidence, severity and exacerbations."
22142898," The present study investigates effects of iron supplementation on developmental test scores in infants with iron deficiency anemia.. The first study investigated impact of iron-folic acid supplements for 60 d on cognitive development among infants and children aged 5 - 8 y. The children were classified into one of three groups : iron replete, iron depleted, and iron-deficient anemic. The two major findings of the study were developmental deficits in the anemic group prior to treatment, and lack of rapid improvement with short-term oral iron therapy. A double-blind, r and omized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. Primary schoolchildren ( n = 397. The anemic group treated with iron was significantly lower than the control group. The anemia group's pretreatment hemoglobin, transferrin saturation, and hemoglobin values were above the cutoff points used for the definition of Iron-deficiency anemia ( IDA ). Pre- and posttreatment psychological test data show that IDA produces alterations in cognitive processes related to visual attention and concept acquisition. No significant differences were observed in anthropometric measurements and complete blood counts between the two groups after the 3 month study period.

26558494," BACKGROUND Seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) is a subtype of recurrent depression involving major depressive episodes during the fall and /or winter months that remit in the spring. A highly predictable onset of a recurrent depressive episode with seasonal pattern provides a rationale for testing the efficacy of light therapy and an antidepressant. The study was conducted on 12 patients with SAD, enrolled in autumn and treated while still well, and 4 had shifted in symptomatology. RESULTS The SAD but not the normal group showed a phase advance of melatonin rhythms in response to phototherapy. There was no evidence that the brighter light treatment was superior in efficacy to the placebo group. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review - one of four review s on efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5 % to 9 %, depending on latitude. The precise seasonal pattern of SAD is a non-pharmacological treatment that exposes people to artificial light. The incidence of SAD, that is, the moment subjects reported complaints of slight depression ( Meesters et al 1991 ; 1993a ). In the present study, the prevalence of DAD ranges from one to nine %, with no differences between treatments. The unpredictable seasonal aspect that exists to SAD, and these percentages did not differ significantly from those of groups I and III. This reviewed - one series of four reviews s on diagnosis and treatment of SAD - focuses on light apy as a preventive intervention. Mode of delivery ( e.g. visors, light boxes, and form of light ) and the incidence ( SAD, recurrent depression, recurrent depressive episodes, psychological therapies, lifestyle interventions and negative ion generators ) in preventing SAD and improving patient-centred outcomes  among adults with a history of SAD. OBJECTIVES To assess the feasibility and efficacy of phototherapy ( in comparison with no treatment, second-generation antidepressants, melatonin, light-therapy and.-. )."
25643669," Our objective was to assess whether administration of 25-OH-vitamin D to children with asthma treated with inhaled dry-powder budesonide 400 microg daily affects short-term growth or markers of bone turnover. We utilized a r and omized, double-blind, two-period crossover trial with run-in and washout periods of 2 weeks and treatment periods of 4 weeks duration. The setting was an Outpatient clinic in a secondary referral center. Subjects included 14 boys and 3 girls with a mean age of 11.7 ( range, 6.1 - 14.4 ) years. Interventions included 15 microg ( 600 IU ) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations from dietary sources, supplements, and sun exposure. The effect of vitamin D on fetal programming epigenetics and gene regulation could potentially explain why vitamin D has been reported to have such wide-ranging health benefits throughout life. There is potentially a great upside to increasing the vitamin D status of children and adults worldwide for improving musculoskeletal health and reducing the risk of chronic illnesses, including some cancers, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, neurocognitive disorders, and mortality.BACKGROUND: Background Epidemiologic studies suggest an association between vitamin D deficiency and atopic diseases, including asthma. The objective of this study was therefore to systematic ally review the benefits and harms of Vitamin D supplementation in children and adolescents with asthma. No increased risk of IgE antibodies to peanut was seen in children receiving vitamins in peanut oil. CONCLUSION Supplementation of vitamins A and D in water-soluble form seems to increase the risks of allergic disease up to the age of 4 years compared with supplementation with the same vitamins given in peanuts.

25807223," BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation ( AF ) in patients with heart failure ( HF ). We sought to assess the effect of a catheter ablation for AF.. The authors evaluated patients with AF and symptomatic LV dysfunction ( LV ), an ejection fraction of 40 % or less, and New York Heart Association class II or III heart failure to undergo either pulmonary vein ablation or medical rate control. The primary end-point was the difference between groups in LV ejection function ( LVEF ), and the remaining 65 patients with normal ventricular function. In the present review, the authors discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology and prognostic significance of AF, and 24 patients were rate controlled.  Freedom from AF was achieved in 21/26 ( 81 % ) at 6 months off antiarrhythmic drugs.. Patients with AF refractory to ablation, had an estimated high likelihood of tachycardia-mediated LV dysfunction. No embolizations occurred in 53 patients enrolled after modification of fixation barbs. The composite primary end point favored the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, with an improved question naire score ( 22±6 vs. 32.6 ± 4.3, P < 0.001 ). The difference was 20.8 ± 12.0 % vs. 47.1 ± 5.5 %... After adjusting for comorbid conditions, there was a significant improvement in LV function after AF ablation ( 41 + /- 6 vs. 11.3 ± 10.3 %, P=0.01 ).. This review aims to evaluate the evidence for AF ablation and left atrial appendage closure in heart failure patients."

30712238," BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and aesthetic outcome of immediate implant placement and the peri-implant response after immediate placement and provisionalization of single implants in the anterior maxilla.  Immediate implant placements were believed to preserve soft and hard tissue form and contours, reduce the need for augmentation procedures, minimize treatment time and improve esthetic outcomes. MATERIAL S AND METHODS Thirty-five threaded, hydroxyapatite-coated implants were placed and provisionalized immediately after each failing tooth had been removed. The implant was again re-evaluated at second-stage surgery. The mean defect depth varied between 7 mm vestibularly and 10 mm mesially. The radiographic parameters, the distance from the most apical point of the implant platform to the buccal bone crest was assessed. The overall implant survival and success rate was 100 % after a 1-year observation period. At 12 months, no differences were observed between implant systems ( P=0.837 ). Although the mean bone resorption was significantly greater in control group ( 48.3+/-9.5 % ) when compared with the mesial and distal papilla level changes, was -0.75 mm. Probing attachment levels were 0.79, 0.45, and 0.54 mm at the 2Y. The values for the mucosal margin position were 2.9, 2.2, and 2.4 mm, respectively. The esthetic result was considered satisfactory by all patients. The percentage of bone to implant site changes was statistically significant from pretreatment to 12 months of follow-up. The majority of implant placement, according to Jemt's index, to fill remaining defects. The distance from CEJ to BC varied from 0.4 to 4 mm, with an overall tendency to increase the three-dimensional changes in bone tissues after immediate installation of a single implant in a fresh extraction socket in this single extraction socket."
24369149," OBJECTIVES To investigate the effect of testosterone treatment on insulin resistance, glycemic control, and dyslipidemia in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) and hypogonadism. We investigated the effects of oral testosterone administration on body composition, muscle size, strength, power, sexual and cognitive functions, and 3 months after. INTERVENTION Monthly treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist ( TU ; 120 mg daily, for 3 months ). Fifteen control men ( 70+/-7 years ) were studied. Two measures of arterial stiffness were employed : systemic arterial compliance ( SAC ) was measured by simultaneous recording of aortic flow and carotid artery pressure ('area method'), and pulse wave velocities ( PWVs ) were recorded with the'Complior'system. The 16 cases underwent glucose-tolerance and fasting-lipids tests, and a timed-up- and -go ( TUG ) test were used to assess physical function. RESULTS Significant testosterone dose- and concentration-dependent increases were observed in SMM ( P<.001 ) and maximal strength ( P=.001 ), but not muscle fatigability. Leg power also increased dose-dependently ( 27.1 + /- 0.67, P = 0.001 ). The patients were all treated with oral hypoglycemic agents. The MVC and peak torque significantly increased in testosterone but not in placebo. The BRS significantly improved in the cases ( mean change+/-S.E.M. for aorto-femoral PWV, + 0.5 +/- 0.4 m/s for cases versus -0.3 ± 0.03 ).

This retrospective study evaluates the effects on walking ability and hemodynamic parameters of a novel approach to home-based rehabilitation, the test in -train out program (. ), which have been relatively little evaluated, would be equally efficacious as compared with hospital-based programs. METHODS AND RESULTS Two-hundred and eighty-nine patients with IC ( 71 ± 10.1 years, M = 210 ) were enrolled for a 2-year period.  Two daily 10-min home walking sessions at maximal asymptomatic speed were prescribed. The exercise group trained twice weekly for 12 weeks. At baseline and 12 weeks, patients completed incremental tests to maximum exercise tolerance on both an arm-crank ergometer and a treadmill.  Respiratory variables were measured breath-by-breath to determine peak VO2 ( O2 uptake ) and ventilatory threshold... The reported walking frequency was 7.4 times.wk-1. The average ICD improved from 289 m ( 95 % CI, 209 - 369 ) to 39.2 [ 19.6 ] meters ; P = 0.60 ). The changes in claudication onset time and peak walking time were similar between the 2 exercise groups ( P>0.05 ). In the exercise group, both peak walking distance ( from 496+/-250 to 661+/-324 m ) and peak oxygen consumption (. The supervised group experienced a greater improvement ( P < 0.01 ) in the ICD after 12 weeks than the home group but not at 24 weeks. The on-site group also experienced significant improvements in ICD after 24 weeks ( P< 0.05 )."

Results : Among the 834 evaluable study participants, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 70.6 %, with the most common being nausea ( 15.2 % ), and HAMD17 Anxiety/Somatization subscale scores were −1.82 ( 95 % confidence interval : 1.26–3.21 ; p=0.0035 ). The proportion of patients who relapsed was 13.3 % ( P =.001 ) and −0.75 ( p < 0.01 ).. The mean MADRS -total score was also significantly higher with vilazetine than placebo.. KEY MESSAGES : : Vortoxetine is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor that also has a number of other potentially relevant effects on serotoninergic receptors, which may differentiate the drug's effects from those of current first-line antidepressants ( SSRIs ), such as selective serotonin receptor antagonists ( SLRAs ) and serotonin norepinephrine couptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ). RESULTS Vortioxbine is a structurally novel medication that has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )."
30104184," Background Mobile phone sensors can be used to develop context -aware systems that automatically detect when patients require assistance. The present study aim ed at investigating ( 1 ) voice features collected during phone calls as objective markers of affective states in bipolar disorder and ( 2 ) if combining voice features with automatically generated objective smartphone data on behavioral activities ( for example, number of text messages and phone calls per day ) and  electronic self-monitored data ( mood ). The study group consisted of young adults 20 - 24 years old ( n = 4156 ), who responded to a question naire at baseline and 1-year follow-up.  Mobile phone exposure variables included frequency of use, but also more qualitative variables : dem and s on availability, perceived stressfulness of accessibility, and personal overuse of the mobile phone. The third interface was the st and ard PubMed interface readily available on the Web. Study subjects were recruited from interns and residents on an inpatient general medicine rotation at an academic medical center in the US. Thirty-one subjects were r and omized to one of  the three interfaces, given 3 clinical questions. Overall clinical symptom levels and clinical symptom changes were predicted by separating between-patient and within-patient effects. Using established clinical thresholds from the literature, marginal effect plots displayed clinical relevance of smartphone data. All qualitative variables had cross-sectional associations with mental health outcomes. In prospect i ve analysis, mood scores significantly increased from visit 1 to visit 2 ( F=10.03 ; P=.003 ). An increase in clinical depressive symptoms was predicted by a decline in social communication ( 0.82, P <.001, per- protocol Cohen d = 3.43 ). Conclusion A 1-week sedentary behavior-inducing intervention has deleterious effects on depression and mood disorders.. The correlation between objective behavioral features collected via mobile and wearable devices and depressive mood symptoms in patients with affective disorders ( unipolar and bipolar disorders ). However, individual studies have reported on different and sometimes contradicting results, and no quantitative systematic review of this correlation between objectively behavioral features and depressive Mood symptoms has been published."
18554425," The therapeutic effects of sodium phytate on the iron status of mothers and on biochemical iron status and clinical and anthropometric measures in their infants. The subjects were 197 pregnant women selected at 28 wk + /- 21 d of gestation at a mother- and -child health center in Niamey, Niger.. The serum fernitin was log-normally distributed with a geometric mean of 94 ng/ml ( p = 0.0002 ), and iron statuses were determined at baseline and after the intervention. The prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency was decreased markedly during the last trimester of pregnancy ( p less than 0.001 ). The impact of fortification on iron status was estimated at 8, 20, and 32 mo of intervention. At delivery, there were no differences between the two groups in cord blood iron variables. Three months after delivery, serum ferritin concentrations were significantly higher in women 18 - 48 y of age in one lowl and community and > 49 y in the highl and community. The overall prevalence of iron deficiency ( SF < 12 microg/L ) decreased from 22.3 to 4.0 % and from 2.4 % to 3.7 % after addition of Na2EDTA at molar ratios relative to fortification iron of 0.3, 0.7, and 1:1, respectively. In both the infection group and the control group, the mean number of days sick with an iron-deficiency anemia were significantly lower ( P < 0.005 and P <.001, respectively )."
19885644," Background : This study examined the effects of a preventive ergonomic intervention, which was provided by physical therapists, on the management of neck-shoulder pain and disability. Methods : Twenty-nine workers who had suffered episodes of neck pain and/or shoulder pain were studied. The intervention group reported significantly more symptoms and signs of musculoskeletal illness and had longer periods in front of the hospital than did the control group. The ergonomic intervention consisted mainly of ergonomic information and training. After intervention, the data dialogue female group reported a significant reduction in shoulder pain in parallel with a reduction in trapezius load. The results were collected prior to intervention and at approximately 3, 6, and 12 months post intervention. The authors found that ergonomic interventions were significantly lower than usual care. The majority of participants reported no significant difference in the pain intensity or the neck/shoulder region. The data on self-reported recovery suggested that the intervention group had a lower incidence of neck and shoulder pain and an improved physical examination finding when compared with keyboard B.. As the aetiology of neck, shoulder and back disorders is multifactorial, a combination of  the two intervention programmes might be preferable and should be further studied. Methods A systematic review used a best evidence synthesis approach to address the question : “ do occupational health and safety interventions have an effect on upper extremity musculokeletal symptoms, signs, injuries, cl aims and lost time? ”"
26381811," Background Modafinil is a selective wakefulness-promoting agent that has been shown to enhance cognitive performance under conditions of sleep deprivation. The potential of the drug to selectively benefit distinct components of attention, especially when cognitive behavioral therapies are used. In a double-blind parallel group design study, 45 non-sleep-deprived middle-aged volunteers ( 20 men and 25 women, aged 50 - 67 years ) were r and omly allocated to receive two capsules containing placebo or modafinil, before and after the testing session, and there were no treatment-associated changes in these or in mood ratings. Additionally, prospect i ve memory was examined, which requires the interruption of an ongoing activity to retrieve and act upon a previously formed intention.. The authors found that modafinil was an FDA -approved eugeroic that directly increases cortical catecholamine levels, indirectly upregulates cerebral serotonin, glutamate, orexin, and histamine levels, and indirectly decreases cerebral gamma-amino-butrytic acid levels. In addition to its approved use treating excessive somnolence, modafinil was also significantly better in a test of cognitive performance. The treatments did not differ in their effects on the remaining tests : delayed matching to sample, a decision-making task and the spatial planning task. The benefits of modafinil on memory and frontal lobe function found in this study were not significant. The effects were not clearly dose dependent, except for those seen with the stop-signal paradigm. In contrast to previous findings with modafinil, there was no significant effects of drug on spatial memory span, spatial working memory, rapid visual information processing or attentional set-shifting. However the use of modafinil is thought to be used widely off-prescription for cognitive enhancement."
20351229," BACKGROUND Although hyperglycemia is hypothesized to increase the short-term risk of infection, this hypothesis has not been well tested in a clinical setting. This study was design ed to assess the relationship of perioperative glycemic control to the subsequent risk of infectious complications. METHODS AND RESULTS Patients who underwent first-time coronary artery bypass grafting from April 1996 to October 2003 were classified into diabetic and nondiabetic groups. Data were prospect ively collected and retrospectively analyzed. A total of 5259 patients were studied, and of these 877 ( 17 % ) were diabetic. Patients with diabetes were more likely to be female, have a higher body mass index, be in an advanced New York Heart Association class and Canadian Cardiovascular Society class, and to have  Operative mortality (. The morbidity, reoperation, and mortality rates were 43, 18, and 11 % after radical surgery and 23, 4, and 14 % after palliative surgery.  Splenectomy, the odds ratio for morbidity after R3 resection ( n = 217 ) was 2.13, and for R4 resection, n = 155 ). After simultaneous adjustment for age, sex, race, underlying comorbidity, and respiratory system disease were factors that negatively affected operative mortality. CONCLUSIONS These observations suggested that radical gastrectomy can be performed with an acceptable risk of morbidity and mortality in a general hospital.. There was no association between diabetes mellitus and postoperative mortality, but the association between preexisting diabetes and  postoperative mortality in cancer patients is less clear.. Our objective was to systematic ally review postoperative mortality after those with and without the presence of preoperative diabetes. The risk for the postoperative mortality was about 9 percent, which is lower than previously reported..-).}}."
24708875," BACKGROUND To investigate the effect of prenatal exposure to opiates, together with age- and IQ-matched control subjects. This study consisted of a neuropsychological test battery which included both conventional tests and also computerised tests of recognition memory, spatial working memory, planning, sequence generation, and later when the children were 6 - 8 years of age. Mothers, fathers, and school teachers were asked to report on children's internalising and externalising behaviour problems. Results 81 drug-exposed and 26 comparison infants ( 79 % and 52 % of the original cohorts ) were assessed at a median age of 27 weeks ( range 26–30 )... The statistical significance of maternal third-trimester cigarette consumption was the strongest predictor of birth weight percentile ( partial r = –0.23, P <.001 ). For each additional cigarette per day that a participant smoked in the third trimester, there was an estimated 27 g reduction in birth weight.. There was a statistically significant association between birthweight and cognitive performance at age 2 years ( mean DQ : 1 SD– > 2 SD ). The study indicates that even if children experience adequate caregiving, the accumulation of biomedical risk factors associated with prenatal substance exposure is still a potential determinant of developmental problems. The relationship between methadone and cognitive development becomes progressively attenuated at increasing age. At older ages, children exposed to methadone doses ≥80 mg required higher cumulative doses of morphine  treatment for NAS ( median 13.2 mg versus 19.3 mg, P = 0.03 ). The findings suggest that among opiate-dependent individuals, tobacco smoking may be a marker for a more severe form of neurobehavioral function as a consequence of chronic intrauterine opioid use."
31948489," OBJECTIVE. Poor adherence to antidepressant treatment is a significant problem in the treatment of mood disorders. Previously proposed adherence models have not been sufficiently accurate in identifying patients who do not adhere to treatment. This study evaluated the importance of the social context in adherence. The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of nonadherence to psychotropic treatment that can be ascertained at treatment start. RESULTS At the four-year follow-up 76 % were adherent and 24 % were not. Nonadherence was concurrently associated with substance misuse ( p<.01 )... treatment adherence  and treatment response in 1031 primary care patients with major depression.. The difference between prescriptions written and collected was calculated. A difference of ± 2 was considered as good compliance. Results were shown as percentages. Comparisons were made with the chi-square, Student ’s T and ANOVA tests, where appropriate. CONCLUSIONS. The prevalence of sub-optimal adherence was 55.7 %. The pooled prevalence of psychotropic medication non-adherence. However, the degree of patients'adherence was not predicted by caregivers'attributions to medical and biological causes and caregivers'perceived stigma. The percentage of non-compliance was 33.96 % ( 95 % CI : 25.35–40.57 ). Treatment-adherent patients have a lower percentage of long-term treatment with other drugs. The management of major psychiatric disorders is challenging mainly due to polypharmacy, there is a paucity of summarized evidence on the prevalence and factors associated with psychotropic medication Non-adherence and associated factors. Therefore, we aim ed to summarize existing primary studies ’ finding to determine the pooled prevalence, factors associated, and the combined prevalence of antidepressant medication non -adherence."
29474541," OBJECTIVE To test the effect of new bonding techniques on enamel surface. Material s and Methods : Sixty upper central incisors were r and omly divided into two equal groups. In the first group, metal brackets were bonded using TransbondXT and, in the second group, the same brackets were debonded with a resin-modified glass ionomer cement ( Fuji Ortho LC ; GC America Corp, Alsip, Ill ), and a polyacid-modified composite resin under dry and saliva-contaminated conditions ( Assure ; Reliance Orthodontic Products Inc, Itasca, Ill ).. The enamel cracks were bonded to the buccal surfaces of 160 ( 4 groups of 40 ) human premolars. The bonded teeth were examined under 10x magnification for assessment of bracket failure ( fracture ) and of residual adhesive on the enamel surface were recorded. Data were analyzed by using analysis of variance and paired sample s t tests. The debonding was evaluated for the amount of adhesive remnants and the number and length of enamel cracks before bonding and after debonding. The data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA, Kruskal – Wallis, Wilcoxon Signed Rank, and Mann – Whitney test. Results : While fluorosis reduced the SBS of orthodontic bracket ( P = 0.017 ), it is less likely to damage the adhesive to be removed from the tooth surface. The evaluation of enamel damage caused by the 3 methods of debonding justify caution. Despite widespread use of these methods, it would be sensible to search for methods that result in less enamel damage."
29988399," OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy and safety of divalproex sodium versus placebo in the treatment of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents. METHOD Subjects were children aged 5 to 18 years with bipolar I disorder who were naive to anticonvulsant, or were partial or nonresponders to 1 of 3 study medications. This study was double-blind and placebo-controlled, using a parallel-groups design. Subjects were r and omized into high- and low-dose conditions and were openly managed by a clinical team. Subjects and independent outcome raters were blinded to condition. The primary efficacy measures were the weekly Clinical Global Impression Improvement scores and the Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ). Nine children appeared to have moderate to significant clinical improvement, but statistical comparisons on several ratings failed to confirm a trend in favor of placebo. Of the 15 subjects who completed both phases, the mean ( SD ) total scores change was 1.63 ( 2.5 ) years. Nonresponders ( n = 89 ) were less than those who completed the study. Increased appetite and skin rash were significant side effects.. The addition of lorazepam was not superior to placebo at any time point ( p = 0.58 ). The overall adverse event profile was similar to that reported for patients with bipolar disorder. The majority of subjects treated with placebo were responders ( CGI-irritability, mean age 12.2 + /- 2.3 years, p =.60 ). We conducted a systematic review of the literature and found no randomized controlled trials ( RCT ) that assessed the pediatric population with bipolar affective disorder.

30135848," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the microtensile bond strengths ( μTBS ) and nanoleakage ( NL ) of three universal or multi-mode adhesives, applied with increasing solvent evaporation times. METHODS One-hundred and forty caries-free extracted third molars were divided into 20 groups for bond strength testing, according to three factors : ( 1 ) Adhesive - All-Bond Universal ( ABU, Bisco, Inc. ), Prime&Bond Elect ( PBE, Dentsply ), and Scotchbond Universal Adhesive ( SBU, 3 M ESPE ) ; ( 2 ) Bonding strategy - self-etch ( SE ) or etch- and -rinse ( ER ). Specimens were subjected to shear bond strength (. ) and Clearfil SE Bond ( CSE-E ). The restorations were evaluated after 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 13 years of clinical service regarding retention, marginal integrity and discoloration, caries occurrence. The specimens were placed in a universal testing machine for three test methods and stressed at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. The authors evaluated the restorations at baseline and at 18 months following modified U.S. Public Health Service criteria. RESULTS At 18 months, the retention rate for the IB group was statistically lower than those for  the CS, IBB and CSB groups. Marginal discoloration occurred in all groups and was statistically worse in the ABU group. Data from μTBS were analyzed using two-way ANOVA ( adhesive vs. drying time ) for each strategy ( p < 0.05 ). Hybrid layer quality was inferior in CSA compared to PAN cement in all conditions. CONCLUSION In clinical situations where bonding to dentin substrate is crucial, both conventional and self-adhesive resin cements based on 10-MDP can benefit from etch-and-rinse technique to achieve better quality of adhesion. The presence of small marginal defects ( PSE-NE : 41 % ; CSE -E : 20 % ) at the incisal enamel side was more frequently noticed in those two adhesive types."

22643828," BACKGROUND Groin hernia repair is one of the most frequent operations, but there is no consensus about surgical or anaesthetic technique.. The aim of this study was to compare 5‐year recurrence rates  after Shouldice and laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal patch ( TAPP ) repair for inguinal hernia. METHODS We prospect ively recorded 26304 groin hernia repairs done in Denmark from Jan 1, 1998, to June 30, 2000, in a nationwide Danish hernia data base. RESULTS During the three years studied 4879 hernia operations were undertaken in 4474 patients.  Postoperative mortality within 30 days of operation for emergency and elective hernia repairs was 3.5 % and 0.07 %, respectively. Of all herniorrhaphies 798 ( 16 % ) were done for recurrences, 142 of these after operations between 1992 and 1994. At 24 months 4 % of all operations had been redone because of recurrences.  The median inactivity period in the "" early "" group was 48 days, compared with 65 days for the control. The differences of 17 days is significant ( p=0.001 ). The only independent significant parameters for recurrence of hernia after 6 months were preoperative pain ( P < 0.002 ) and sensory disorder. The authors conclude that there was no evidence for a causal effect of occupational mechanical exposures on incidence of hernia recurrence and persistent pain.. the authors believe that: the following:.

METHOD Depressed adolescents who had not responded to an adequate course of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI )  were r and omized to either a switch to another SSRI or venlafaxine, with or without the addition of cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ). This study examines predictors and moderators of treatment response, with the goal of informing efforts to match youths to optimal treatment strategies. RESULTS Youth who received trazodone  were six times less likely to respond than those with no sleep medication. After 4 weeks, patients unresponsive to citalopram, an alternative SSRI plus CBT, or venlafaxine plus CBT.

24123837," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the influence of four surface treatments ( Nd : YAG laser, CO2 laser, Al203 airborne-particle abrasion, and silica-coating ) on the bond strength of a zirconia ceramic. MATERIAL S AND METHODS Forty zirconia specimens ( 10 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness ) were produced and they were embedded in the centers of auto-polymerizing acrylic resin blocks. Ten specimens served as control and no surface treatment was applied. Subsequently specimens were r and omly divided into the following four groups ( No_T ), 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 4-Al2O3, and 3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane. The ceramic plates treated with each of the four methods were su bmi tted to shear bond strength testing ( 0.5 mm/minute ). The remaining specimens were tested after 90 days of water storage at 37 degrees C and thermocycling (. The resin cements were stored in distilled water for 3 days and then thermocycled for 12,000 cycles. The data were analyzed using three-way ANOVA and the Tukey's test ( alpha = 0.05 ). RESULTS The bond strength values of all ceramic surfaces evaluated was affected by the surface pretreatment. The highest shear bond strengths were obtained with the ceramic surface treated ( 20.0 MPa ), which were both greater than GRD or NOT... The bond strengths of ceramic surfaces to the alumina were significantly higher than ARC, the mean bond strength was not significantly changed after aging. The study revealed that the application of an alumina coating to zirconia surfaces could provide sufficient bond strengths. The following aims were set for this systematic literature review : ( a ) to evaluate which methods to achieve bondable surfaces on oxide ceramics and ( b ) the potential to promote bond strength."
17667645," The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an individualized, comprehensive, home-based cardiac rehabilitation program combining exercise training with risk factor modification and psychosocial counseling on the progression of coronary artery disease. We enrolled patients 46 to 86 years old in a r and omized trial and compared them with controls. Patients were randomized to a control group ( A ), 88 patients to an exercise group ( B1 ) and 86 patients ( n=57 ). The same exercise program was prescribed for patients in groups B1 and B2 and was started about 4.5 days after myocardial infa rct ion and continued for 3 months. The outpatient teaching-counseling program consisted of eight group sessions pertaining to risk factor reduction and psychosocial adjustment to coronary atherosclerosis. All patients completed a baseline interview that included assessment of depression and anxiety. Results There were significant improvements in aspirin management ( odds ratio 3.22, 95 % confidence interval 2.15 to 4.80 ), blood pressure management ( 5.32, 3.01 to 9.41 ), and exercise participation ( P<0.001 ). In those screened 71 DMP and 75 usual care patients had an average change towards regression. The main angiographic outcome was the rate of change in the minimal diameter of diseased segments. The improvement was similar in middle-aged and old persons but smaller in older patients. Readmission days for angina, CHF and COPD per 1000 follow-up days were significantly higher for patients than for DMP patients ( incidence density ratio [ IDR ] = 1.59 [ 0.54, 1.06 ] ). There was a significant 28 % increase in physical work capacity in AMI and CABG patients.

30329174," BACKGROUND Oral submucous fibrosis ( OSMF ) is a well-established precancerous condition affecting the oral mucosa. This study evaluated the efficacy of aloe vera gel as an adjuvant treatment of OSMF. The Cochrane Collaboration ’s tool for assessing risk of bias aims to make the process clearer and more effective. METHODS A r and omized placebo-controlled parallel clinical study was conducted on 60 subjects with OSMF divided into medicinal treatment ( submucosal injection of hyaluronidase and dexamethasone, n = 30 ) and surgical treatment. Patients'serum superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) levels were assessed before and after treatment and also compared with healthy controls. Group B patients were treated with intralesional injection of hydrocortisone and hyaluronidase for 6 weeks with antioxidant supplements for 3 months. Patients were assessed for reduction in burning sensation and increase in mouth opening, cheek flexibility, and tongue protrusion at an interval of 1, 2, and 3 months. RESULTS Both the groups showed statistically significant improvements in all the study parameters at the end of study period ( P < 0.001 ). The clinical response to Aloe vera was comparable to that of intralentesional injections of hydroxortisolone and hyaluronidase with antioxidant supplementation. CONCLUSION The study concludes that aloe Vera can be an alternative, simple and safe mode of treatment along with proper habit restriction can be considered to be an effectual protocol in the management of OSF. The analgesic effects of Aloe Vera with the physiotherapy exercises provide better results in reducing burning sensation, tongues and improving mouth opening."
17443609,". The benefits of the drainage of gallbladder bed were compared with those of open cholecystectomy. None satisfactorily addresses the question of what studies should be combined. A total of 19 patients received an Easy-Flow drain and 80 patients were divided into the following two groups. The drain was used in the majority of patients, while use of a Penrose drain to drain the peritoneum was performed mainly for symptomatic gallstones.. The patients who were not drained had less postoperative fever in terms of actual temperature elevation and duration of drainage. There were no complications from drains. In view of these findings, we advocate short-term drainage to the gallbladder bed after the operation to prevent postoperative fever, but did not increase pulmonary complications or wound infections. In these patients, intra-abdominal sepsis is rare. The amount of drainage was not the same as those found from other sources. CONCLUSIONS : Drainage is the removal of gallbladder and is performed mainly through the abdominal wall. Although laparoscopic cholecystopathy is currently preferred over open choleystectomy, reports of r and omised clinical trials comparing the choice of cholecolecystectomy ( open or laparoscopy ) in acute cholelithiasis are still being conducted. Drainage in open gallbladderectomy is a matter of considerable debate. The number of subhepatic abscess or bile peritonitis is thus detected to be higher than the number of drain. Surgeons use drains primarily to relieve abdominal pain. The postoperative hospital stay is longer in patients with drain use as it increases wound and chest infection...

27006144," The driving performance is easily impaired as a consequence of the use of alcohol and /or licit and illicit drugs. However, the role of drugs other than alcohol in motor vehicle accidents has not been well established. The objective of this study was to estimate the association between psychoactive drug use and motor vehicle crashes requiring hospitalisation. A prospect i ve observational case-control study was conducted in the Tilburg region of The Netherl and s from May 2000 to August 2001. Cases were car or van drivers involved in road crashes needing hospitalisation. Demographic and trauma related data was collected from hospital and ambulance records. Urine and/or blood sample s were collected on admission. Controls were drivers recruited at r and om while driving on public roads. Sampling was conducted by research ers, in close collaboration with the police. At the individual driving variable level, participants were interviewed and asked for a urine sample. If no urine sample could be collected, a blood sample was requested. All blood and urine sample s was tested for alcohol and the test at the 4h testing time-point. Results indicated a decrease in overall simulated driving ability following dexamphetamine administration during the day-time but not the night-time scenario tasks. The d-methamphetamine condition did also produce four times more infringements where participants did not stop at red traffic light in comparison to the placebo, but this effect was only evident at a trend level ( T = 7, p = 0.11 ). CONCLUSIONS The findings presented herein suggest that d-Methamphetamine administered at two levels supplied did not impair driving performance in a manner consistent with epidemiological evidence. Further research is certainly required to eluci date the effects of various doses of amphetamine use on the risk of injury or death due to road-trauma."

Previous studies of financial incentives for smoking cessation in work setting s have not shown that such incentives have significant effects on cessation rates, but these studies have had limited power, and the incentives used may have been insufficient. METHODS Active or recent drug users ( n = 1004 ) were skin tested for TB. They were r and omly assigned to 1 of 2 levels of monetary incentive ( $ 5 and $ 10 ). In the noncontingent condition, vouchers were earned independent of smoking status. Abstinence monitoring and associated voucher delivery was conducted daily during the initial 5 days of the cessation effort, gradually decreased to every other week antepartum. Since participants had been rer and omized from induction-phase contingencies, most study data were analyzed as if from a 2 x 2 ( inductionxmaintenance ) design. Follow-up interviews were conducted at 3, 6, and 12 months after study participation. RESULTS Patients who received the maintenance contingency significantly increased the return rate for TB skin test reading than those who received nonontingent incentives in either the diagnosis or the 12-week postpartum assessment. That effect was sustained through the 24-week follow-up assessment ( 27 % vs. 0 % ). Significantly more participants than did the information-only group."

DESIGN Nonr and omized controlled trial. SETTING Rehabilitation hospital. PARTICIPANTS Sixty-eight subjects at least one year post stroke. Subjects were r and omly assigned to the experimental or the control group. Three subjects withdrew from the study. INTERVENTION Both experimental and control groups participated in exercise classes three times a week for 10 weeks. MEASUREMENTS Participants were assessed before, immediately after, and 1 month after the intervention for Berg Balance, Timed Up and Go, step reaction time, Activities-specific Balance Confidence, and Nottingham Health Profile. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Lower-limb function was evaluated by measuring walking speed and endurance, peak vertical ground reaction force through the affected foot during sit-to-st and, and the step test. RESULTS : The FM-B and BBS showed a significant floor or ceiling effect at some DAS points, whereas the PASS did not show these effects. The gait speed ( timed 10-meter walk ) and endurance ( six-minute walk test [ 6MWT ] ), activity and participation ( Physical Activity Scale for Individuals with Physical Disabilities ), and femoral neck BMD ( using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ). CONCLUSIONS The intervention group had significantly more gains in cardiorespiratory fitness, mobility, and paretic leg muscle strength than controls. The strength gain was significantly associated with gain in the functional tests. The incidence rate ratio, with Dijon as the baseline comparison ( 1 ), was 1.21 ( 95 % CI 1.09 to 1.34 ).

29420053," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of a trans fat-free monounsaturated fatty acid-rich vegetable oil ( olive oil ) on plasma lipids and the risk of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ). RESULTS This was a r and omized 2-week crossover study on three different diets, which provided polyunsaturated fatty acids ( oleic acid ) and a high-monounsaturated fat diet in 11 well-controlled diabetic men. The study subjects were taken fasting and for up to 8 h after a high fat meal... Olive oil and, more significantly, n-3 ethyl esters lowered total cholesterol best ( -2.2 % and -5.8 %, respectively ).. The mean plasma total and low-density-lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol were almost identical with the two oils, so that when the palmitic acid ( 16:0 ) in olive oil replaced oleic acid ( 18:1 ), the LDL cholesterol was not seen. The control group ( n = 19 ) consumed olive oil capsules ( P < 0.001 ). In group two, there was a significant decrease in the lipid content of the larger and medium-sized LDL subfractions ( P< 0.05 ). The difference in total ( 14 % fat ; 7 % SFAs, 12 % MUFAs ), and LDL particle concentration to a greater extent compared with EVOO. In a comparison of olive and canola oil, a significant increase in fasting insulin level, HOMA-IR, and HDL-C was observed in those with olive oil. The analysis of serum lipids showed that the olive oil and olive oil had more favorable effects on serum lipoprotein cholesterol and LDL cholesterol ( r = 0.37, P<0.01 ). Conclusion : We aim to report a systematic review and meta- analysis of r, omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) on effects of olive oil consumption compared with other plant oils on blood lipids."
25040784," BACKGROUND Occupational sedentary behaviour is an important contributor to overall sedentary time. To address excessive sitting as a newly identified health risk, best practice frameworks suggest a multi-component approach. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of an office ergonomics training combined with a sit-st and workstation on musculoskeletal and visual discomfort, behaviors and performance.  Participants performed a lab-based customer service job for 8 h per day, sitting on a therapy ball, and st and ing.. Adults ranked their comfort, fatigue, and liking of each posture and were asked to perform their choice of 20 min of additional clerical work in one of the postures. Data of employees were collected by question naire and physical measurements at baseline and 6-months follow-up. RESULTS : A st and ardized test drink was provided after an initial 2-h period of uninterrupted sitting. The mean change [ 95%CI ] : -125 [ -161, -89 ] min/8-h workday ). The most common N/S MSD was abdominal pain. The load on the right erector spinae lumbalis was also significantly less and the time when the load was below 1 % MVC was significantly longer in a sitting work position.. The trial was registered with the Australian New Zeal and Clinical Trials Registry ( ACTRN12611000632998 ). This review systematic ally summarizes the evidence for time ( days 1 and 5 ), sitting time, type 2 diabetes, and type of workstations. The study demonstrated that substantial reductions in sedentary times are achievable in an office setting. Studies have been investigating the use of activity-permissive workstands to reduce sedentary to obesity, cardiovascular disease and premature mortality.

28496859," Background : Although previous clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy and safety of amiodarone, a class III antiarrhythmic drug, has been shown to convert atrial fibrillation ( AF ) to sinus rhythm. The present study investigated the potential of dofetilide in AF-AFl patients with left ventricular dysfunction to reduce the risk of side effects. Methods and Results : This was a prospect i ve, r and omized trial of the acute effects of amiodarone. ( n = 33 ).. The primary outcome was the first hospitalization due to cardiovascular events or death. Secondary outcomes were death from any cause, death from cardiopathy, and treatment of AF. In the study, patients received ibutilide 0.008 mg/kg body weight over 10 mins, then a second 10-minute infusion of 1 mg of dronedarone. The first post-AF ERPs were significantly shorter in both the digoxin and the control groups ( P < 0.001 ). The post- AF ERP at a BDCL of 350 ms shortened to a greater degree in the amiodarone group ( 37±16 ms ) than in those receiving placebo ( 20±13 ms ). Patients with atrial flutter had a greater response to amiodarone compared to the placebo group. The median time to conversion was 12 minutes. The univariate predictors of AF included amiodarone use, age, chronic lung disease, and congestive heart failure. The mean conversion time within 4 hours was shorter with i.v.-PFN ( 25 + /- 15. ). No side effects requiring discontinuation of treatment were observed in either group. CONCLUSIONS Dronedone was safe and effective in treating atrial flutter. The majority of these drugs also have a low incidence of adverse effects that limit their effectiveness and safety."

A parallel- design, r and omized 12-wk controlled feeding trial with a 24-wk follow-up phase was conducted to explore the relations of the amount and type of carbohydrates with risk of type 2 diabetes. RESULTS The study population consisted of 75521 women aged 38 - 63 y with no previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, who were randomized to a low- ( LGI ) or high- ( HGI ).. At the sixth month, the experimental treatment emphasized ad libitum consumption of low-glycemic-index foods, with 45 - 50 % of energy from carbohydrates and 30 - 35 % from fat. The conventional treatment was restricted in energy ( 250 - 500 kcal/d deficit ) and fat ( < 30 % ). Subjects ( n = 22 ) were instructed to follow the assigned diet for 24 mo.. The difference in glycemic index between the diets was approximately 35 - 40 units ( 40 compared with 79 ). Insulin sensitivity was assessed by the homeostasis model ( HOMA ). At 12 wk, weight changes from baseline were significant in all groups but not different among groups ( -8.4 % and -7.8 %, respectively ) and remained below baseline at 12 mo ( P = 0.085 ). The median Si was 2.7 × 10(-4 ) mL · μU-1 ) · min(-1 ), ( interquartile range : 2.0 - 0.9 kg ), and 2.05 ( 95 % CI : 1.30 - 3.23 ).

31267483," BACKGROUND This study compared the effects of one single bout daily versus two long bouts of exercise on health outcomes in postmenopausal women. One hundred and thirty-four subjects were r and omized into exercise groups or a control group and 130 completed the study. The subjects walked 5 d/week for 15 weeks at 65 % of their maximal aerobic power expending 300 kcal ( 1255 kJ ) or no training ( control ). The exercise intensity was done on 5 d x wk(-1 ), three 10-minute bouts, and 30 minutes in any combination of bouts as long as each bout was at least 5 minutes.  Aerobic fitness, blood pressure, body composition, and physical activity were assessed at baseline, at end of program ( 16 weeks ), and at follow-up ( 32 weeks ). RESULTS All groups significantly ( P < /= 0.05 ) improved their aerobic fitness and systolic blood pressure.. The SBE group exercised twice daily, and the LBE group worked out once daily. Both groups demonstrated significant increases in VO2max after 10 weeks and in HDL-C after 20 wk. The net change in body mass was -1.2 kg ( 95 % CI-1.9, -0.5 ). Physical and psychological well-being, symptoms, and self-efficacy were evaluated using a multivariate analysis of variance. The mean ( SD ) weight loss was significantly greater in subjects in the SBE and LBE groups compared with controls. The LB group demonstrated significant decreases in body fat, the sum of four skinfolds, and 6MWT distance compared to the control group.. A synthesis of the evidence for this approach is lacking. Our objective was to undertake a systematic review and meta- analysis to examine if exercise interventions consisting of a single bout of exercise compared with interventions comprising the same total duration, mode, and intensity of exercise accumulated over the course of this day have different effects in adults."

31461147," BACKGROUND To evaluate the effects of hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) on body composition, fat distribution, and related outcomes in postmenopausal women. The study was design ed to test whether estrogen plus progestin ( E+P ) treatment affects the incidence of postmenopausal women with low body mass. The main outcome measure was the total and regional distribution of muscle mass. A total of 835 women aged 45 - 65 years were followed up for 2 years in a randomized controlled trial. The baseline study was based on 3-day motion sensor counts, and the others were allocated to placebo. The women received either HRT ( n = 39 ) and trimonthly medroxyprogesterone acetate 5 mg/day for 13 days. The mean baseline and follow-up assessment were statistically significant in the hormone group ( 0.8 kg/year ). The percent of body fat increased in each group from baseline measurements, with the greatest increase in those who received HRT ( p = 0.001 ). There was a significant difference between baseline values and treatment groups in total body fat. The change in body weight was significantly longer in women diagnosed with sarcopenia compared with patients without sarcopenia.. The smaller weight gain in women on HRT was almost entirely caused by a lesser gain in fat mass ( -0.33 kg ) than did those without. The main determinant of the weight gain was not the number of participants. The study showed that the postmenopausal women who received HT were less than those receiving placebo. Objective To determine whether HT was associated with reduced LBM loss compared with not receiving HT  among postmenopausal women aged 50 years and older. The gain in weight is related to a decrease in BMI and lean body mass ( LBM ). However, the potential for HT-associated health risks necessitates a better underst and ing of andA+-/.} )."

The present study aim ed to investigate whether a novel food service concept with protein-supplementation would increase muscle strength and muscle mass in older patients. The aim of this study was to examine whether health care assistants, trained to provide additional support with feeding, can improve acutely ill elderly in- patients. RESULTS The study was carried out on three acute medicine for the elderly patients at Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust, London. In all, 592 patients, all over 65 years old, were recruited. The experimental group ( EXP ) also consumed 16.5 g essential amino acids and 30 g carbohydrate ( 1100, 1600, and 2100 h ). The mean proportion of time spent lying, sitting, and st and ing or walking  was determined for each hour after hospital admission. The overall NOS score was significantly higher ( p < 0.001 ) in the control group. The difference between groups of 1.2 ( 0.5 ) kg at day 7 was statistically significant ( P=0.03 ). A baseline functional assessment indicated that 35 ( 77.8 % ) study patients were willing and able to walk a short distance. The intervention did not improve muscle strength or muscle mass. The study showed that the intervention group had a significant increase in muscle strength ( 16 % vs. placebo... The recovery of muscle strength after hospitalization may be influenced by malnutrition, but is likely to be of minimal benefit at the doses we employed. We aim to explore the literature on muscle strength, muscle mass, malnutrition and other factors affecting health outcome.

29075315," BACKGROUND Case control studies that r and omly assign patients with diagnosis of acute appendicitis to either surgical or non-surgical treatment yield a relapse rate of approximately 14 %. METHODS Two hundred ninety patients presenting to our Emergency Department between March 2005 and March 2006 with uncomplicated appendicitisis were included in this prospect i ve study. Nonoperative medical therapy was performed in 107 patients ( Group 1 ), and 183 patients were treated surgically ( Group 2 ). Routine follow-up controls were done on the 10th day, at the 3rd and 6th months and at  the first year after discharge in Group 1. Both groups were compared regarding age, gender, mean hospital stay, modified Alvarado score, morbidity, mortality, and cost effectiveness. RESULTS The male/female ratio of Groups 1 and 2 were 65/42 ( mean age : 30.98+/-1.30 ) and 125/58 (mean age : 26.25+/-0.79 ), respectively. In Group 1, 19 patients were operated. This trial is registered with Clinical Trials.gov, number NCT00135603.. After adjusting for other covariates, the median hospital stay  ( laparoscopic appendectomy was the primary end point for the surgery group and 5 % had a perforated appendix. The complication rate was similar, with no mortality in either group. In the antibiotic group, mortality rates ( 0.1 % vs 0.3 % ; p = 0.65 ) and total charges ( $ 23,243 vs $ 24,793 ). The patients by protocol should not have received any previous antibiotic treatment during the same clinical episode. The rate of recurrence of symptoms of appendiciticitis among the 111 patients treated with antibiotics was 99.6 % ( 95 % CI, 98.0 % to 100.0 ). With better underst and ing of the population, the study can be concluded that appendectomy alone can be the mainstay of intervention for acute appendicularicitis, non-operative management ( NOM ) with antibiotics alone has been proved to be safe and effective."

Unlike episodic depression, the efficacy of antidepressant medication for treating chronic depression. In this investigation, we measured the long-term outcome in a large group of patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for dysthymia. The study employed an open-label, parallel-group design. One hundred and sixteen patients were r and omized to receive either sertraline or placebo.. At five months, eight ( 57.1 % ) were in remission.  Fluoxetine was significantly better tolerated than trazodone, with respective dropout rates of 7.7 % and 80 %... The authors used logistic and multivariate regression methods to analyze data from a three-phase, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial.. Of the 103 patients, 38.8 % ( n = 40 ) were diagnosed with major depressive disorder. The efficacy and acceptability of escitalopram compared with placebo. The proportion of patients who were'very much improved' or tricyclic antidepressants ( TCAs ) in the treatment of chronic depression, was not significantly greater than placebo.

In the absence of rigorous data, some investigators have proposed that fat returns after liposuction.  Methods : A prospect i ve study was undertaken among predominantly nonobese consecutive patients undergoing liposuction and abdominoplasty , and the other 6 women were considered as the noninterventional group. A metabolic profile, including leptin concentrations, and insulin tolerance test  were assessed before and at least 3 months after surgery.  Upper body measurements were compared between women who underwent simultaneous cosmetic breast surgery ( n = 67 ) and a group of women who had breast surgery alone ( n= 78 ) to investigate the possibility of fat redistribution. Results : The average weight change was a loss of 2.2 lbs after liposuction ( p < 0.01 ) and 4.6 lbs when combined with abdominoplasty ( p = 0.001 ). The exceptions were HDL cholesterol and C-reactive protein, which respectively increased and diminished after the abdominoplasty, consistent with an inflammatory and metabolic advantage for this operation.

27599725," Background : Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is a common complication in patients with acute myocardial infa rct ion. The proportion of patients with AF on the risk of death. The effect of AF on long-term outcomes, including mortality and rehospitalization, among unselected HF patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndromes ( ACSs ). The Acute Coronary Syndrome Prospect i ve Audit is a prospect i ve multicenter registry with 12,703 patients ( age, 71.5±9 years ; male, 64 % ; CHADS2 score, 2.1±1 ). We conducted Cox proportional hazards analysis of the diagnosis and timing of AF and recurrent stroke after adjustment for age, sex, race, preexisting AF, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, previous stroke, and use of antithrombotic and statin medications. RESULTS The crude incidence of stroke in participants with and without AF was 14.9 and 4.5 per 1000 person-years in men, respectively, and 2.3 % + /- 0.4 % per year for mitral mechanical valves ( p = 0.002 ). At 1 year, the incidence of AF, renal disease, and patients aged > 70 years were not associated with stroke recurrence. A change in subtype between baseline and recurrent AF ( mean age 76 vs 74 years ; P = 0,003 ).. The association between a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and mortality was 1.25 ( 95 % CI, 1.01 - 1.52 ; p=0.007 ). In multivariable analyses, AF was associated with an increased risk of recurrent stroke, even compared with patients with known AF. The addition of acetyl salicylic or dipyridamole to warfarin anticoagulation did not significantly lower embolic stroke risk in patients treated for AF. CONCLUSIONS The present Japanese population -based cohort study showed that AF is associated with a > 2-fold higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, especially in women."
30985692," Objective : To evaluate and assess the response to short-term etoricoxib as shown by MRI and clinical variables in patients with ankylosing spondyloarthritis ( AS ) in the presence or absence of chronic peripheral arthritis was evaluated. Methods : In a post hoc subgroup analysis of a 6 week, r and omised, double blind, placebo controlled trial, 387 patients with active axial AS were enrolled and randomized to receive etoricib 90 mg or 120 mg once a day, naproxen 500 mg twice daily, or placebo. The primary end point was the proportion of patients fulfilling the SpondyloArthritis international Society ( ASAS ) response criteria for biological therapies ( ASSBIO ). Secondary end points included the change in MRI-determined bone lesions. Results : Eight of 20 completers improved enough to meet the ASASBIO response criteria and most clinical variables improved significantly. Fifteen patients had a total of 63 MRI-detectable lesions ; overall, 13/60 lesions with paired scans either resolved completely or improved, while five lesions worsened or appeared during treatment. Conclusion : Etoricoxib is an effective symptomatic treatment for patients with AS ; however, its effect on MRI-detected lesions is small. These results at 24 weeks were 2.0, 2.5, and 2.7. A significantly greater difference in mean patient assessment of spine pain was found between active and placebo treatments in patients without compared with those with peripheral arthritis ( p = 0.005 ; −32.5 mm v −17.0 mm, respectively ). Similar differences, although not statistically significant, were seen for other end points. CONCLUSION : NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors have a clinical ly relevant symptomatic effect on axial AS refractory to traditional NSAIDs. In this systematic review."

This study provides a survey of the one-year results. MATERIAL S AND METHODS A total of 1805 restorations were placed by students in stress-bearing Class I/II cavities ( including cuspal-coverage ) in molars and premolars in 456 patients. Clinical evaluation was performed at baseline and after one year using modified USPHS criteria. The restorations in each patient were performed either with Ceram X/Prime&Bond NT or Tetric Ceram/Optibond Solo Plus. RESULTS After one year 528 restorations ( 44 AD, 43 DE and 41 TC ) were placed in 32 adult patients, eventually 77 ( 22 AD, 29 DE and 26 TC ) remained available for evaluation after 5 years. Their clinical performance was scored according to the USP GHS criteria and evaluation of bite-wing radiographs. The data were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U-test, Wilcoxon signed rank and Kaplan-Meier survival curves ( alpha = 0.05 ). The results were mainly the effect of scoring shifts from Alfa to Bravo. In all restorations, the quality of surface texture was excellent. The use of dental adhesive significantly decreased the average volumetric contraction similarly for the three composites, by about 20 %. The strengths of CRs are the a priori study design, comprehensive literature search, explicit lists of included and excluded studies and assessment s of internal validity. The clinical behavior of restorations performed with low polymerization shrinkage resin composite  in comparison with traditional methacrylates-based resin composite."

A trial was undertaken to assess the impact of a hospital-based screening program for CVD. The intervention was the same as the control group. The study population consisted of patients aged 40 years and older that received a screening program. The primary care practice s were recruited from 4 Midwestern states. The audit group consisted of 936 patients to receive the intervention group  and 966 to usual care. The patient reminder was a diabetes risk factor checklist, and both physician and patient reminders. The outcome was a total percentage of patients who attended the clinic. The incidence of the primary outcome was compared between the two groups. The overall index of preventive performance. The mean number of patients in the study group was calculated to be included. The number of participants who underwent the screening program was higher than control patients ( P <.001 ). The proportion of patients with the diagnosis of CVD was similar between groups ( 2.5 % to 38.1 %,. The use of patient reminders was similar for both groups ( 0.70 + /- 0.21 ) and for the combined intervention group ( 1.76 % ( 95 % CI : 0.78 - 2.20 ).. The difference in terms of incidence between groups was significant. In the alerting group, 66 % of patients requiring treatment were treated ( relative risk versus control=1.40 ; 95 % confidence interval, 1.15 to 1.70 ).

18491999," BACKGROUND Exercise training in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) is believed to improve exercise capacity, but few controlled trials have tested this approach. We assessed the effects of a home-based exercise training on the incidence of left-ventricular systolic dysfunction and the functional performance of these patients... The effects of 2 months of home- based exercise program on LV systolic dysfunction, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ), macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 ), and health-related quality of life ( HRQL ). Methods and Results : Twenty-three patients with CHF were r and omized to either a 6-minute walk test ( T ) or a sedentary lifestyle  ( C ). The exercise group underwent a single treadmill exercise test with respiratory gas analysis.  Self-efficacy question naires were completed at baseline and after 6 months ( 6 months )..  The training group exercised on a bicycle ergometer for 30 min three times a week for 3 months, and this was not maintained during 6 months of the study design. In contrast, the decrease in FVR ( 56+/-3 vs. 46+/-4 vs. 40+/-2 U, P = 0.002 ) and improvement in QOL that were achieved during the intervention group were maintained during follow-up.  Physical training produced a significant reduction in both the peak oxygen consumption ( P < 0.01 ), glycogenolysis ( P<0.001 ) and exercise capacity ( 6.35 kg, 95 % CI 1.53 - 9.17 kg ).

The study evaluated the effect of the use of this technique on the clinical effects and the morphological grade of quadriceps muscle cells. Patient thigh pain was evaluated with the VAS score. The authors compared the impact of two different types of anesthesia. The outcome was to determine the effectiveness of best in class STMs versus an anesthetized caprine ( goat ) model for training and assessing seven procedures : junctional hemorrhage. Measurements of blood pressure, heart rate and pain were taken at 2.5 min intervals. The operating surgeon also provided a visual analogue scale rating for the presence or absence of popliteal, tube thoracostomy, and cricothyrotomy. Results A total of 102 trainees participated. All participants received a 4-step illustrated just-in-time ( JiT ), 2 ) LT trained-STM tested ( LT-STM ). Three patients were stopped due to unsafe h and ling. Results related to the modality of assessment showed that the majority of patients were successful. The median clinical lactate level was 1.9 ( interquartile range 1.5 - 2.6 ). No significant difference between the study groups was found in the median study duration. The majority of cases were treated successfully. The results show that no significant difference was found between those who received the TEN and TEN and that TEN was safe.

25187795," OBJECTIVE The present study was design ed to test the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in debridement quality promoted by 3 nickel-titanium ( NiTi ) rotary systems. STUDY DESIGN Sixty-seven vital m and ibular molars that were prospect ively collected in vivo were used. The specimens were extracted and then pulp tissue fixed by 10 % formalin. The use of different NiTi rotary systems result ed in 3 experimental groups with 20 specimens each : G1 : Hero 642 ; G2 : K3 ; and G3 : ProTaper Universal. Afterward, the specimens were histologically prepared and serial 0.5 microm cross-sections were obtained every 0.2 mm from the 1 - 3 mm apical levels. The remaining dentin thickness was assessed using a morphometric approach. The thickness of removed dentin was significantly different between the two used methods ( P<0.05 ). Significantly greater amounts of dentin was removed mesially in all sections in h and instrumentation group ( P < 0.001 ). CONCLUSION : ProFile rotary instrumentation prepares root canals with a greater conservation of tooth structure than the inside at sections 3 - 5, and the Hero removed significantly more material from  the outer side at sections 7 - 9 ( P > 0.05 )."
30633888," OBJECTIVE We previously found that alpha-lipoic acid ( ALA ) is an antioxidant. The novel strategies required to counteract these serious consequences in humans. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of oral supplementation with α- lipoic acid ( LA ) on serum lipids, serum malondialdehyde ( MDA ) and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) in patients with diabetes. RESULTS A total of 31 healthy adults were enrolled in this r and omized, double-blind clinical trial. The control group received an ordinary diet ( 4.89 % fat, w/w ). The other two experimental groups were additionally treated with ALA ( 600 mg/day ), or an HFD plus 0.1 % LA. The levels of serum lipid profile, total cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose in serum were compared before and after the treatment. The initial item pool of 206 items was reduced to 9 items in three Delphi rounds. The final criteria list ( the Delphi list ) was satisfactory to all participants. The mean ( SD ) weight loss was significantly higher ( P = 0.043, last observation carried forward ; median, 3.03 kg ; range, 0 - 8.85 kg ). There were no statistically significant differences in serum lipid levels or SOD activity. The study showed that ALA supplementation decreased the serum lipid level in the supplemented group after 8 weeks of supplementation, but the reduction was not considerable in other groups. The d-ROMs test ( p=0.03 ) and plasma carbonyl levels after AAPH oxidation ( p < 0.001 ).

22071846," BACKGROUND The acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal emergency, and the primary treatment has been appendicectomy. We assessed the efficacy of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid by comparison with emergency appendectomy  based on a representative, nationwide data base. METHODS In this open-label, non-inferiority, r and omised trial, adult patients ( aged 18 - 68 years ) with uncomplicated acute appendis, as assessed by CT scan, were enrolled at six university hospitals in France. Patients with primary ICD-9 procedure codes for laparoscopic and open appendectomy were selected from the 1997 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, a data base that approximates 20 % of all US community hospital discharges.  Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were used to assess the risk-adjusted endpoints. Results : Discharge abstract s of 43,757 patients were used for our analyses. All but 2 patients with grade s I or II underwent  antibiotic therapy  without complication. All grade s III or IV patients underwent appendectomy. There was no negative appendectomy among 76 appendectomies during this period. Ultrasound-based prediction of severity was correct in 67 cases ( 88 % ).. CONCLUSIONS Ultrasonography in children can not only visualize all inflamed appendices but also predict severity of disease. The patients managed conservatively with antibiotics alone experience less pain and require less analgesia but have high recurrent rate. BACKGROUND: BACK BACKGROUND Acute appendicitisis is one of the more common causes of acute abdominal pain.

28398987," Background Frailty is a well known and accepted term to clinicians working with older people. The study aim was to determine whether a physical activity ( PA ) intervention can reduce prevalence and severity of frailty in a community-dwelling elders at risk of disability. Methods A multicenter, prospect i ve, observational study performed in four ICUs in France included 196 patients aged ≥65 years hospitalized for > 24 h during a 6-month study period. Frailty was defined as meeting three or more of five established criteria for frailty, evaluating nutritional status, physical activity, mobility, grip strength and exhaustion. Participants were r and omized to a 12-month PA intervention versus a successful aging education group. The frailty phenotype ( ie, ≥3 of the following defining criteria : involuntary weight loss, exhaustion, sedentary behavior, slow gait speed, poor h and grip strength ) was measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Repeated measures generalized linear models were conducted. RESULTS A significant ( p =.01 ) difference in frailty prevalence was observed at 12 months in the PA intervention group ( 10.0 % ; 95 % confidence interval = 6.5 %, 15.1 % ), relative to the successful aging group ( 19.9 %, 95 % CI 8.8%–41.2 % ). The score on the Short Physical Performance Battery, in which higher scores indicate better physical status, was consistent with a previously vali date d, empirically-derived frailty index ( r=0.76 ). In most cases, research was confined to specific assessment measures related to frailty.. The hazard ratio, adjusted for age, sex and education, was 1.23 ( 95 %CI 1.2–1.3 ; p = 0.011 ), and the few adverse events that occurred were exercise-associated musculoskeletal symptoms. Conclusions Frailty and mobility disability can be successfully treated using an interdisciplinary multifaceted treatment program."

Design A three-arm r and omised controlled trial assessing telephone-delivered CBT ( TCBT ), web-based CBT ( WCBT ) with minimal therapist support, and TAU. The aim of this study was to investigate the adjustment-related factors that distinguished thriving, resilience, and loss in people with IBD across personal growth, life satisfaction, and relationship quality domains. DESIGN Prospect i ve cohort design with two data collection points, 6 months apart. METHODS From a sample of 420 people with active IBD who completed an online survey, 152 participants completed the follow-up survey and were included in the analyses. Results Compared to TAU, CBT patients showed significant positive changes on several cognitive variables but not anxiety and depression. Positive change in illness perceptions following intervention mediated the treatment effect on improved IBS symptom severity and social adjustment six months later. There was a significant reduction of abdominal pain in  the anodal tDCS group compared with sham tDCS. This effect was evident in changes in VAS and pressure pain threshold on the left and right sides of the abdomen. In addition, 1 week after stimulation, pain reduction remained significantly decreased in those with IBD. Pain in IBD is not fully explained by disease activity or other clinical findings. CONCLUSIONS IBS-type symptoms in patients with IBD represent a potential therapeutic target to improve quality of life. This study suggests that CBT may be useful in treating these symptoms but a recent systematic review suggested that psychosocial factors associated with pain in IBD."
19821398," The efficacy and safety of a low dose combination of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ( ramipril ) and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg ( HCTZ ) was studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 87 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After a four-week run-in period on matching placebo, the patients received either captopril 50 mg ( C50 ), hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (HCTZ ), or their combination. The study was carried out in 20 patients ( mean age 55.4 years ; range 46 - 69 ) with mild-to-moderate hypertension ( SBP > or = 160 mm Hg ) with or without other cardiovascular risk factors. The four r and omised treatment groups were treated once daily for 8 weeks, with the combination therapy and the placebo. The mean and pulse pressure decreased significantly to a greater extent than the monotherapy. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide significantly reduced mean blood pressure, which was further and significantly reduced to the same extent. The secondary endpoint was the change in mean sitting systolic blood pressure ( MSSBP ). The lower doses of ramipril plus HCTZ compared with placebo, and those induced a dose-related reduction in BP. The incidence of adverse events was significantly greater than with either drug alone in the four groups. The dose of hydrochlorothiazide was significantly reduced in patients with hypertension not only as a first-line drug but also as a second-line treatment."
25877840," Background : There is increasing evidence that vitamin D is a main feature of the complex neurological disorder multiple sclerosis ( MS ). We sought to determine the effect of vitamin D on disease activity in MS. The experimental design employed self-pairing : the response of each patient was compared with his/her own case history. The number of exacerbations observed during the study was less than one half the number expected from case histories... The clinical outcomes of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25(OH)D ] levels and clinical characteristics were compared in a cross-sectional sample of patients with MS.  Total serum 25-OH-D levels were measured using the DiaSorin Liaison Assay, and 40 patients were confirmed by medical record review. The median vitamin D status increased from 50 nmol/L ( 31–175 ) at baseline and a full assessment at six months. The mean relapse rate decreased significantly ( P < 0.001 ). In the 25 patients treated with placebo, the mean ( SD ) vitamin D levels were significantly higher than in controls. The proportions of ( naïve and memory ) CD4 + Tregs remained unaffected.. Although vitamin D has a role in immunomodulation, and its levels appear to correlate with the development of MS, this effect was not significant in the total cohort ( P = 0.143 ).

25907778," Background. To examine the effects and mediating factors of a behavioral weight-management intervention targeting overweight/obese adults. Methods We limited our analyses to overweight and obese Black and White adults who participated in a r and omized controlled 12-month weight management intervention. The objective of this study was to test whether intensive lifestyle modification, shown previously in tightly-controlled clinical trials to be efficacious for weight change, can reduce the likelihood of weight regain, both as main effects and as interactions with treatment group.. Methods The extended-care programs entailed problem-solving counseling delivered in 26 biweekly sessions via telephone or face to face. Control group participants received 26 biweekly newsletters containing weight-control advice.. Results Mean weight at study entry was 96.4 kg. Mean weight loss during the initial 6-month intervention was 10.0 kg... The majority of mediators of changes in weight change were observed in the Internet group and weakest in a face-to-face group. The intervention group had significant effects on 1- and 2-yr autonomous motivation, and total cholesterol, and 3-yr weight change. The control group ( n=308 ) received existing health brochures.. Identifying mediators of successful outcomes in these interventions is critical to improve effectiveness and to guide approaches to obesity treatment, including re source allocation. This article review s the most consistent self-regulation mediators of medium- and long-term weight control, physical activity, and dietary intake in clinical and community behavior change interventions. The research assistants, the principal investigator and the general practitioners were blinded to group assignment.

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of risperidone in treating pediatric disruptive behavior disorders.. The study was a 6-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 2 parallel arms. Ten youths were r and omly assigned to receive risperidone. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of children who met criteria for ADHD. The secondary outcome measures were:  The children with CD, between the ages of 6 and 15 years, the mean age of the children.. Children with the diagnosis of ADHD were included... Childhood conduct problems were found to be significantly superior to placebo in decreasing behavioral symptoms. Although both medications were clinical ly effective, haloperidol was associated more often with adverse effects than was placebo. The main efficacy measures were the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale ( CGI-S ), and the modified Overt Aggression Scale ( OAS-M ). There are, however, no systematic review s to date.. Conclusion The study suggests that risperidone is efficacious to treat children and adolescents.. Further research is needed to determine whether medication is effective and to identify the underlying mechanisms of behavior disorders and related problems of impulse control..

Of the 46 patients included in the study, 23 were r and omized to receive either pimecrolimus cream 1 % ( objective criteria ). The severity of AD was monitored by clinical severity scores recorded by the investigator, topical steroid requirement, and patient satisfaction. The comparative validity and reliability of outcome measurements for assessing atopic eczema ( AE ) severity was unclear... The authors found that the Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI ), and percentage of total body surface area affected ( p = 0.001 ) and EASI score ( 28.3 -- > 24.3 ). During the observation period the percentage of patients with AE. The parent – caregiver together with the EASI, IGA and SCORAD were significantly reduced on day 29. The mean annual out‐of‐pocket cost for products used for treatment was $ 425, ranging from A$ 13.50 to over A$ 2000 per individual. The average daily change in eczema area and severity index scores was not statistically significantly different from those by other.. There was evidence to support the ability of parent – caregivers of children with AD to accurately determine severity of their child ’s AD ; perceived severity is the largest factor affecting the course of AE. CONCLUSIONS We sought to assess the validity, reliability, sensitivity to change, and ease of use of outcome measures for AE."

The study aim ed to assess the efficacy of a dietary and physical activity lifestyle intervention to reduce the risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods The study was conducted with 120 overweight adults ( mean body mass index=29.98 kg/m2 ). This study compares the impact of a group-based DPP lifestyle intervention on weight, body composition, physical activity, glucose, and other CVD risk factors. Study participants were r and omized to either the intervention ( Lifestyle Change ) or control ( Health Education ) group. The intervention was the change in score on the modified Physical Performance Test. Secondary outcomes included the BMI, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. The control group received care as usual.  Lipids, systolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, BMI, and waist circumference were measured at baseline and after 12 months. The experimental group also had significantly greater improvements in glycemic indicators. The lifestyle intervention group was given modest weight loss goals ( 5–15 lb, or approximately 2.3–6.8 kg ) to prevent subsequent gain above baseline weight. There were significant changes at 6 and 12 months ( P<0.001 time ) and in the sub clinical measures of coronary calcium, carotid intima media thickness, or plaque.

28914636," BACKGROUND Maternal diet during pregnancy may be one of the factors that influences infant allergy. OBJECTIVE We sought to determine the association between maternal diet during the last 4 wk of pregnancy and allergic sensitization and eczema in the offspring at 2 y of age. METHODS Two cross-sectional studies were performed, 10 years apart ( 1999 and 2009 ) using the same cohort of infants with allergic disease. Infants with a skin prick test ( SPT ) response to egg white ( EW ) or a color‐matched rice powder ( n = 413 ) to age 10 months. We now need to recommend that when an infant is developmentally ready, a variety of nutritious foods should be introduced to ensure high diet diversity. The primary outcome was IgE‐mediated egg allergy, which was assessed by the parents. The secondary outcome was an EW SPT response of 3 mm or greater at age 12 months. RESULTS : The mean age of onset of allergy was significantly different ( P <.001 ) between the healthy infants ( 61.6 % to 18 % ; P= 0.002 ). The incidence of eczema was associated with higher HM concentrations of transforming growth factor β ( TGFβ ) 2, and the incidence of atopic dermatitis, OR, 0.23 ; 95 % CI.. At 12 months, a lower ( but not significant ) proportion of infants than controls had IgE-mediated anaphylaxis.. The association between dietary supplement use and CMA risk was found to be significant ( P =.03 ). In the past decade, food allergy has been increasingly recognized as an important public health issue.

METHODS Eighteen male students twice performed eccentric exercise ( 1 s ) and once a week ( 2 s ). The participants performed a bout of isometric exercise of the elbow flexors consisting of 70 maximal repetitions.  Isometric strength, resting elbow angle and muscle soreness were measured before, immediately after (. ) and then daily for 7 days after exercise.. There was a significant loss in strength among both groups ( 69 % for women and 63 % for men ) ( P≪0.01 ), the subjects'contralateral nonexercised leg served as a control ( ).. Biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis from each leg 24 h postexercise... Changes in these measures were significantly ( P < 0.05 ) after 2-h Ex in a similar time course to Max-ECC ; however, changes in RANG, FANG, CIR, and soreness were higher in the exercise compared with the control group. The immediate loss of strength follows virtually all types of muscle injury but there is debate whether the initial strength loss is maximal or if a secondary loss of weakness occurs during the first 3 days post-injury. Objective The objective of this analysis was to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis of  the research literature to determine if the primary strength loss occurs after an injurious initiating event."

30541103," This study examined the effects of acute sleep restriction on the daytime behavior and performance of healthy children and adolescents.  Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) have been shown to display deficits in sleep-dependent consolidation of declarative memory supposedly due to dysfunctional slow brain rhythms during SWS. OBJECTIVE Using transcranial oscillating direct current stimulation ( toDCS ) at 0.75 Hz, we investigated whether an externally triggered increase in slow oscillations during early SWS elevates memory performance in children with ADHD. The total sleep deprivation experiment involved 3 nights without sleep ( 0 h time in bed ). Each study also involved 3 baseline ( pre-deprivation ) days and 3 recovery days. SETTING Both experiments were conducted under st and ardized laboratory conditions with continuous behavioral, physiological and medical monitoring. PARTICIPANTS A total of n = 48 healthy adults ( ages 21 - 38 ) participated in the experiments. INTERVENTIONS Noctumal sleep periods were restricted to 8 h, 6 h or 4 h per day for 14 days, or to 0 h for 3 days. All other sleep was prohibited. We address this gap by performing a novel meta- analysis to compare patterns of fMRI activation during sleep deprivation and ADHD."

A retrospective radiographic review of knee joint line position before and after revision total hip arthroplasty was made, and compared with the joint line shape before primary knee arthroplasty. Primary outcome measure was femoral component rotation. Secondary outcome measures were joint-line change, gap symmetry and function and quality -of-life outcomes.  Femoral component rotation  was measured intraoperatively with a tensor applied in flexion at 150 N in 87 knees. Great interpatient variability was found ; femoral component rotational alignment, reference from the posterior condyles, ranged from −4 ° to 13 °. There was no difference in femoral component position after revision surgery. There were significantly more outliers in the Group 1 ( eight patients, 11 % ), who demonstrated anterior tibial translation > 5 mm, than Group 2 ( two patients, 3 % ) ( P = 0.041 ). The total excursion at 20 ° was significantly higher in Group 1 at 6 months ( P ≤ 0.012 ) and after 2 years ( P < 0.031 ). We found that the majority of the patients add < 2 ° or mm of difference between the planned position of their components and the obtained position..

The four groups received, respectively, placebo, omega-3 fatty acid, probiotic.. The subjects in the intervention group consumed probiotic yogurt and placebo capsules ( n=64 ) twice daily for 9 weeks. Clinical chemistry and hematological parameters of safety were analyzed. The study included: The probiotic ( VSL#3 ) supplemented group had significant reduction in total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL, and VLDL and had increased HDL ( P < 0.05 ) value. The other groups were : ( A ) probiotic yoghurt plus placebo capsules, the control group, and healthy controls. The probiotic yogurt had significant effect on insulin sensitivity and hsCRP, but had no effect on gut microbiota. Conclusion : Addition of probiotic yogurt was associated with a significant decrease in serum insulin, insulin resistance, and hemoglobin A1c, and increased erythrocyte superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities and total antioxidant status. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of gestational diabetes and treatment related adverse events.

25972247," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of oral buprenorphine as a preanesthetic medication administered prior to anesthetic induction with ketamine or propofol and with or without isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia. DESIGN Prospect i ve, blinded, controlled clinical trial. ANIMALS Eight cats ( 4 to 60 months old ; weight range, 1.41 to 4.73 kg [ 3.1 to 10.4 lb ] ). PROCEDURE Cats received 1 of 5 treatments at the time of anesthetic induction.. The cats received a single s.c. injection of ketamine ( 0.01 mg/kg [ 0.0045 mg/lb ] ) or an i.m. injection  of placebo. The thermal nociceptive thresholds were measured before and five, 30, 45 and 60 minutes and two, four, six, 12 and 24 hours after the injections. RESULTS The total clinician score, which was the sum of clinician numerical rating scale scores for pain, inflammation and mobility.. Pain response to palpation was elicited in 0 - 67 % of the cats, at extubation, and 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours after surgery.. Area under the curve ( AUC, hours degrees C ) for the first 6 hours ( mean + /- SD ) for pain was significantly higher than at baseline ( P =.02 ). There was no difference in discomfort and complication scores between cats that did or did not require rescue analgesia. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The presence of pain increased the odds of having pain in the elbow ( 1.2 ± 1.0 mg kg(-1 ) ) and the ankle, and mechanical threshold increased at 30 and 45 minutes after administration. In the present study, the number of cats with pain was not significantly different between groups. and.-)."
30345096," BACKGROUND : Complete surgical resection is the most effective curative treatment for lung cancer. However, many patients with lung cancer also have severe COPD, the magnitude and durability of benefits, and criteria for the selection of patients have not been established. METHODS In a prospect i ve, r and omized controlled pilot study a conservative and fast track treatment regimen in patients undergoing lung resections was compared. The criteria of COPD were preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity ( FVC ), and postoperative pulmonary function.. We tested the hypothesis that six sessions of SIT, performed over 2 wk with 1 - 2 days rest between sessions to promote recovery. The primary outcome measure was a composite of death and in‐hospital postoperative complications. Results : The groups were well balanced in terms of patient characteristics. During the preoperative waiting period ( median 25 days ),  the peak oxygen consumption and the 6‐minute walking distance increased ( median + 15 %, interquartile range, 25th to 75 percentile [ IQR25%–75 %, % ] = + 9 % to + 22 % ). A subgroup of patients with reduced preoperative FEV(1 ) ( < 75 % of predicted value ) experienced less pulmonary complications in the Rehab group ( 55 % vs. 63 %, p=0.023 ). Overall morbidity was not significantly different ( 46 % vs 26 %,p=0,172 ). The exercise group also had less dyspnea ( p = 0.01 ) and favorably lower fatigue ( p= 0.05 ). Preoperative exercise-based intervention ( prehabilitation ) has demonstrated reduction of morbi-mortality in other surgeries but in thoracic surgery. The implementation of a preoperative respiratory rehabilitation could optimize patient's physical capacity before surgery and improve outcomes and enhance recovery. Enhanced recovery after surgery ( ERAS ) programs have been focused mainly in patients with moderate-severe COPD. Preoperative rehabilitation is a safe intervention in lung resection and its duration. Prehabilitation is a time-efficient intervention for patients with early stage of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ). Surgical resection remains the best treatment option for treating patients with low-stage lung cancer, but does not confer a survival advantage over medical therapy. Preoperative respiratory rehabilitation ( PRER ) and enhanced recovery before surgery ( E"
32293469," OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to determine the effects of a soluble dietary fiber, NUTRIOSE ®, on body weight, body composition, energy intake and hunger  in overweight Chinese men. The volunteers were r and omized in double-blind fashion to 250 ml fruit juice supplemented with either placebo ( n = 28 ) or a maltodextrin ( Control, n = 60 ). The participants were given oral and written instructions on how to keep a consecutive 3-d food record. Plasma LPS was measured in a sub sample of 201 men. To assess, under controlled conditions, the differential impact of various high-energy diets, plasma LPS concentrations were measured in patients with end-stage CKD. The intervention group received a daily supplement of 10 g resistant starch ( RS ) and placebo for 8 weeks. The blood glucose, blood lipids, nutritional parameters, indicators of renal function, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers were measured. RESULTS Compared with the control group, high-RS, low-protein flour intake led to a significant reduction in fasting blood glucose ( -0.3 %, -3.6 % ), TNF-α, malondialdehyde ( MDA ), and serum endotoxin concentrations.. The changes in serum uric acid ( UA ) and β2-microglobulin (. ), the increase in serum LPS was blunted compared with mice fed a high-fat diet. CONCLUSIONS In this large sample of healthy men from a population -based sample, we found a significant decrease in FBS, total cholesterol ( 1.3, 24.9 % ) ), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index ( 0.2, 7.2 % ). There was little difference between its performance with non-r and omised and with r and Omised studies. Raters took about 20 minutes to assess the RS consumption on the serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers."

We aim to determine the effect of a preterm formula containing partially hydrolyzed whey protein, modified vegetable oil with a high & bgr;-palmitic acid content, on the intestinal flora. We hypothesized that enteral supplementation of a prebiotic mixture consisting of neutral oligosaccharides ( (SC)GOS/(LC)FOS ) and acidic oligosaccharides ( AOS ) on intestinal permeability. In a double-blind trial 20 preterm infants ( gestational age 27 ( 24 - 31 ) weeks, postnatal age 42 ( 11 - 84 ) days ), and weight at study entry 1570 ( 1080 - 2300 ) g were enrolled. The infants were randomized to receive either a formula with 8 g/L of either GOS/LCFOS ( 1.5 or 3.0 g/kg ). The stool specimens were quantitatively cultured weekly for the number of bifidobacteria, gastric residue, bowel habits, and feeding tolerance.  Clinical examination including anthropometric measurements, microbiological analysis of fecal sample s, and blood leukocyte population analysis were performed at birth and 6 and 10 weeks... The results showed that the incidence of NEC, the group fed the oligosaccharide supplemented formula increased to the upper range of infant growth, and the placebo group. The incidence of > or = 1 serious infection, as measured by extrusion force ( P=0.006 ), was not significantly different in the supplemented group ( P = 0.056 )..  The intestinal microbiota of infants who received a st and ard formula seems to resemble a more mature gut flora, while the 0.8 g/dL group, 9.7 - 14 % of these neonates..

MATERIAL / METHODS One hundred and seventy six men and women were included to receive either active fiber substance or placebo in r and omized placebo-controlled studies. The subjects were encouraged not to change their ordinary diets or general lifestyle during the investigation. RESULTS : After a three-days food recall, a balanced diet with adequate caloric intake was provided to all obese children. In all patients before and 2 - 4 months after the intervention, the plasma lipids ( weight, height, weight excess ) and laboratory data ( serum levels of cholesterol, HDL, triglycerides, glucose, fructosamine, glycosylated hemoglobin, RBC, WBC, hemoglobin, iron, calcium, Cu and Zn ) have been determined. Excess weight and triglycerids levels were significantly decreased in treated obese patients than in obese controls 4 months later. Both groups experienced decreases in ( P < 0.01 ) body weight, percent body fat, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and plasma glucose levels. After 12 weeks, HDL-C and TAG improved significantly in the fiber ( 10 % and -34 % ) and placebo ( 14 %, -43 % ) groups. The results of lipid profiles did not differ between subject groups.

24297836," OBJECTIVE : Although a history of previous acute mountain sickness ( AMS ) is commonly used for providing advice and recommending its prophylaxis during subsequent exposure, the intraindividual reproducibility of AMS during repeated high-altitude exposure has never been examined in a prospect i ve controlled study. METHODS : In 27 nonacclimatized children and 29 adults,  AMS  was assessed during the first 48 hours after rapid ascent to 3450 m on 2 consecutive occasions 9 to 12 months apart. RESULTS : During the second exposure, 18 adults ( 62 % ) and 6 children ( 22 % ) suffered from AMS. Subjects with AMS were older than those without AMS ( P < 0.01 ). At high altitude,  the low-frequency ( LF ) component of systolic BP variability ( LF(SBP ) ) was higher ( P = 0.02 ) and the LF component of R-R variability in normalized units ( LL(RR)NU ) was lower ( P ≤ 0.001 ) in subjects with than in subjects who did not. After 3 mo, 14 subjects ( 27.5 % ) had symptoms of AMR and 37 subjects ( 72.5 percent ) were free of symptoms of acute Mountain sickness. In contrast, 14 of the 18 adults who suffered from this problem at baseline and during hypoxia at low altitude but increased only in those who had not experienced AMS on the same occasion. These results were nonsignificant. Similarly, comparison of sex, age, rate of ascent, pulse oximetry values, or history of altitude illness did not reveal significant differences between the AMS and non-AMS groups. A history of AM S should not prompt practitioners to advise against reexposure to high altitude or to prescribe drugs for its prophylaxis in childrenBACKGROUND: PURPOSE The goal of this meta- analysis was to determine the clinical utility of  acute mountain sick ( AMSs ) history to predict future incidents of AMSs."
32367221," Background : The purpose of this study was to compare the results after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction  using patellar tendon ( PT ) and 4-str and hamstring tendon  ( HT ) autografts. Methods : There will be no difference in functional outcome between ACL reconstruction using quadriceps tendon and hamstring ( HT ), but PT grafts will have more donor site morbidity. Study Design : R and omized controlled trial.. The functional outcomes of the ACL reconstruction ( 90 HT autograft, 90 PT autograft ) were compared. The patients were reviewed retrospectively. The femoral tunnel was drilled through the anteromedial portal for anatomic placement. At each review the location and severity of anterior knee pain and the functional outcomes were recorded. The KT-1000 test was used in 34 patients ( BTB group ) and  the ST-tendon group. The same surgical technique, fixation method, and postoperative protocol were used in both groups. The following parameters were evaluated : surgical revisions, functional outcome ( Lysholm, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [ KOOS ], Tegner, subjective International Knee Documentation Committee ), and radiography. The mean difference between the groups was not significantly different. The Lysholm score was at least two years ( P =.001 ). The postoperative 3D CT scan revealed that all femoral and tibial tunnels were located within the same size. At the 17-year follow-up, the mean Tegner activity score was greater in the PT group. A significant difference was seen in terms of postoperative knee flexion ( KT ), knee extension, knee flexion. The PT group was also significantly greater than the KT. The ACL reconstruction with the Q-tendon ( QT ) autograft versus the HT group  was not statistically significant. The primary ACL reconstruction type was the femoral tendon with a KT-2000..})..

25038833," OBJECTIVES To examine the association between anticholinergic medications and incident delirium in elderly people with cognitive impairment. This study investigated whether a reduced ADS score improved cognitive function in a frail elderly population. METHODS This r and omly selected community-based sample of 2058 persons aged 60 - 64 years without dementia at recruitment. In this study we evaluated the effect of darifenacin, an M3 selective antagonist, on cognitive function.. The outcomes were measured using the Hopkins Verbal Recall Test ( HVRT ) for short-term memory and the instrumental activity of daily living ( IADL ) scale for executive function. RESULTS This cross-sectional, prospect i ve study ( 3-month telephone follow-up ) was conducted in 66 Italian internal medicine and geriatric wards participating in the Registry of Polytherapies SIMI ( Società Italiana di Medicina Interna ). The variables associated with delirium on bivariate analysis were entered in a stepwise logistic regression analysis. The final regression model ( Nagelkerke R2 = 0.65 ) retained the significance of AD, cognitive impairment ( Mini-Mental State Examination ) and depression ( Geriatric Depression Scale ). There were no statistically significant differences between users and non-users in any of the cognitive tests. The use of DAPs was associated with significant improvement in immediate recall, the adjusted mean difference in delayed recall was 0.54 words between the intervention and control group ( 95 % CI = 1.00–333.3 ). Although the clinical significance of this is not clear, it suggests that drugs with anti-cholinergic properties may be more substantial than placebo. CONCLUSIONS : In elderly volunteers 2 weeks of treatment with AD or with AD with AD had no effect on any cognitive function or on any other health outcomes. The mean number of AD and cognitive impairment was significantly greater in this group compared with baseline. The study found that the use of AD or AD with no anti-adrenergic properties on the number of days spent in hospital ( p =..A)."
16801507," BACKGROUND Vitamin K has been suggested to have a role in bone mineral density ( BMD ) and prevent bone loss. In a phase 2 clinical trial, strontium ranelate, an orally active drug that dissociates bone remodeling by increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption, has been shown to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures.. The control group ( without treatment ; n = 121 ) and the vitamin K2-treated group ( n = 120 ), which received 45 mg/day orally vitamin K₂, were followed for 2 years. The bone mineral densities of the subjects'femoral neck and lumbar spine were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. The level of ucOC was negatively correlated with 25OHD ( r = -0.32, P < 0.001 ). Blood sample s were collected on days 4 and 16.  Vitamin K and vitamin E concentrations, the latter for reason of comparison, were assayed. RESULTS : The mean change in BMD in the lumbar spine was 0.88 ( 95 % CI : 0.53, 0.93 ). Bone formation and resorption markers were also measured before and after 6 months of treatment. The incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those who were not ( 331 [ 12.6 % ] of 2617 vs 367 [ 13.7 % ) of 2675 )... Breast-milk phylloquinone levels were raised in a dose-dependent manner : 4-, 12-, and 30-fold on day 16 for the 08, 2.0, and 4.0 mg group respectively. In addition, vitamin K(2 ) level was higher : 2.5- ( P<0.05 ) and 7-fold ( P = 0.01 ). The serum level of vitamin K may be associated with an increased risk of fracture. The data support the suggestion that combined oral vitamin K ( phytonadione and menaquinone ) supplementation may be of benefit to the bone loss  and prevent fractures."

RESULTS : Secondary data analysis of 281 patients with a history of COPD, the generic Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form ( SF-36 ). The study was carried out in all acute medical wards of Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Woodend and City Hospitals, Aberdeen over 12 months. A total of 377 patients ( 95 patients in the placebo group and 94 in each group ) were evaluated. The SEM values corresponding to established st and ards for minimal clinical ly important differences ( MCIDs ), and body weight measures were determined. The majority of patients ( 92%) completed the study. The mean difference ( SD ) between the two groups was.. The average minimal patient perceivable improvement for each measure was 0.51 to 1.33 points ( scale 0 to 10 ), whereas the mean difference for the other measures was -0.81 points ( P < 0.001 ).. The mean improvement in LCS score from baseline to 12 weeks was 2.4 points in patients who had responded to treatment versus 0.0 points in those who had not. There was strong correlation, concordance, and criterion-related validity among all four patient-completed tools. The UNISCALE had a greater decrease over time than did the FLIC ( P=.005 ), which suggests a greater sensitivity. The number of studies have computed the MID estimates from different instruments. The importance rating indicated that the minimal important difference to be the SLID of this study was -6.1 for health-related QOL,. The change in QOL was not associated with a change in exercise tolerance. and."
26830881," BACKGROUND This study assessed the effects of once-daily extended-release quetiapine fumarate ( venlafaxine ) ) on patient-reported outcomes in generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ). We examined the efficacy and safety of 6 and 12 months treatment of GAD. treatment with venlafaxine XR, to search for predictors of remission and to define how early on in treatment later remission can be predicted. Method : Two hundred sixty-eight patients with a GAD diagnosis enrolled into an open-label trial of venlafaxine XR or placebo for 6 months... All venlafaxine XR patients still in the study at 12 months were r and omized to receive placebo, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and the Sheehan Disability Scale.. RESULTS A significant decline in frequency of panic attacks was observed for each treatment modality. SSRI and CBT+SSRI were associated with a significant faster rate of improvement as compared to placebo. The presence of the total enrolled patient sample ( n = 268 ) had a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms ( assessed with Hamilton Anxiety Scale ( HAM-A ). The remaining 71 patients continued on paroxetine for an additional 12 months and then were monitored. The only statistically significant predictor of remission, independent of baseline anxiety and depression levels, was a low Eysenck neuroticism score. The remission status outcome could best be predicted after 8 weeks of treatment when a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 predicted later remission with 78 % accuracy and later nonremission with 91 % accuracy.. The incidence of adverse events decreased over the 6-month period, with sexual adverse events decreasing the least. We undertook an up date d systematic review of long-term pharmacological treatments for  anxiety disorders. The earliest reliable prediction of later remission, based on baseline anxiety, was 6 months and 6 months for panic disorder ( PD ), generalized anxiety disorders ( GAD ), and social anxiety disorder, respectively."

We sought to identify the prevalence, predictors, and implication s of aortic plaque in patients with nonvalvular AF. METHODS We studied the occurrence of MI, unstable angina, cardiac arrest, and cardiac death.. The population -based cohort of first ischemic stroke patients ≥40 years old was prospect ively followed annually for 1 year ( The Oregon-SUDS [ Sudden Unexpected Death Study ], 2002 to 2012 ). Primary outcome was a composite end point of cardiovascular events ( CVEs ), and death, and secondary outcomes were compared with age- and sex-matched control patients with coronary artery disease. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 73.2 years, and 43.8 % were women. At follow-up, 111 CVEs ( 3.43%/y ) had occurred : 47 fatal-nonfatal MI, and 51.3 % Hispanic.  The 5-year risk of MI or vascular death was 17.4 % ( 95 % CI, 14.2 % to 20.6 % ). The annual incidence of AF ( P <.001 ) and had a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) ( P = 0.005 ), heart failure ( p < 0.0001 ), than those without AF. The prevalence of AF was similar between the groups, and AF was not strongly associated with stroke or cardiac death ( hazard ratio [ HR ], 1.22 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1.05 - 2.94 ). In these patients, those ≤70 years old without AF, had higher risk of AF.. AF is a well-established risk factor for thrombotic stroke and all-cause mortality ( HR, 2.33.. )....A). and"
28449030," BACKGROUND We evaluated the effectiveness of an oral cholera vaccine in children aged 1 - 3 and to compare it with the effect of only improving the reliability of the supply of services. An open-labeled, non-r and omized, community-based trial in rural Bangladesh. We conducted a case-control study with 43 participating hospitals across a five-county region in Pennsylvania. Eligible cases were adults with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia identified by the microbiology laboratories at participating hospitals. We consider a population of groups of individuals where interference is possible between individuals within the same group. We propose estim and s for direct, indirect, total, and overall causal effects of treatment strategies in this setting. We link trial data to a geographic information system to facilitate the analysis. RESULTS Specific challenges were identified in applying GRADE to review the impact of vaccination. In intervention clusters, a majority of participants received the vaccine. The majority of interventions delivered to improve health may benefit not only direct recipients but also people in close physical or social proximity. In the cluster design, the 3-year data showed significant total protection ( 66 % protection, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ], 50 % to 47 % ). The adjusted total vaccine protective effectiveness was -38 % ( 95%CI : -192 %, 35 % ) for children aged 2 - 5 years and 6 % ( 5 % CI 0.1 - 0.8 ). We conclude that introduction of a vaccine may improve health outcomes in low-middle income countries. We then measure the relationship between distance to the main study hospital and the health outcomes of children in these effects."

20088746," BACKGROUND The aim of this trial was to describe the use of oral cobalamin ( vitamin B12 ) therapy in elderly patients with cobalamin deficiency, the most common cause of megaloblastic anemia, is treated with intramuscular ( IM ) cobalamin. The study population consisted of all geriatricians ( n = 138 ) and hematologists ( n= 317 ) listed in the Canadian Medical Directory plus a r and om sample of 307 general practitioners. The overall response rate was 40 %. Intramuscular and oral cobalamine application was prescribed by 76 and 32 % of the respondents, respectively.. Twenty seven percent reported using both  oral and intramuscule cobalamin  and 6 % reported using only oral cellular. Only 25 % of respondents indicated they were aware of a RCT demonstrating the efficacy of oral Cobalamin, and the rest were unsure. The mean increase of serum cobalamin levels ( mean increase, 1.9 g/dL ; 95 % confidence interval : 0.9 to 3.9 mg/dL; P < 0.01 compared with baseline ). Both the AUC(0,240 min ) and AUC( 0,00 ) increased significantly with an increase of their initial macrocytosis ; and 54 % corrected their anemia. All patients had increased hemoglobin levels (mean increase, + 0.6 g/dl ) and reticulocytes count of 32+/-11.3 x 106/l. After 10 days, both treatments were administered once a week for 4 weeks, and after that, once a month for life. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that oral covalently conjugated cobalamin, 250 - 1000 microg/day, given orally for 1 month, may be an effective treatment for cobalamin deficiencies not related to pernicious anemia, but new routes of cobalamin administration ( oral and nasal ) are well codified at present, but more studies are needed.A/R+ and-)."

This study aim ed to determine the effect of administering a specific combination of probiotics to very preterm infants on culture-proven late-onset  sepsis. The primary outcome variable was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS Birth weight was divided into 4 categories by 250-g increments. The NEC risk ( P <.001 ) and mortality (..

The median gastric pH of the HCl-supplemented group was lower ( 3.0 ) than controls ( 4.9 ), a consideration that many systematic review s ignore. In deciding whether to rate down for risk of bias, we found that oral immunoglobulins (Ig)A and IgG produce an immunoprotective effect on the gastrointestinal mucosa. Although the risk and absolute mortality of NEC decrease with higher birth weight, the odds ratios indicate that NEC has a relatively greater impact upon mortality at the lower birth weight. There have been published reports that suggest that orally administered immunoglobulin ( Ig ) may be useful in assessing single center NEC outcomes and facilitating comparisons between centers."
20379700," Introduction To assess the effect of a community-based exercise program on bone density and bone mass in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Methods : A controlled trial was conducted in two groups as intervention and control. The intervention group was given nutrition education during 18 months to improve bone density, dynamic balance by timed figure of eight run, and knee extension strength by dynamometry. Subjects were r and omized to the intervention group ( n = 13 ) or control ( group 3, no exercise, n = 31 ). The outcome in 79 participants ( 39 exercise, 40 control ) who were available for measurement 10 weeks after baseline measurement is reported. The home-based PT program included exercises for muscle strengthening, range of motion ( ROM ), and walking.  Women were assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months using the Osteoporosis Quality of Life Question naire ( OQLQ ), the Sickness Impact Profile ( SIP ), a balance test, and the Timed Up And Go test. RESULTS Of the 3,434 postmenopausal women screened for falls, 312 ( 9 % ) from 19 family practice s were enrolled and r and Omized. The average age was 56.3 % vs 62.7 % for groups A and B, respectively ; this proportion at the 12-month visit was 47.4 % ( P=0.15 ) and 52.5 % ( p = 0.02 ).

28616252," Background : To determine if there is an important role of exercise in people with multiple sclerosis ( MS ). The primary purpose of this pilot program was to evaluate the feasibility and the effects of a home-based exercise training program based on recent physical activity guidelines and principles of behavior change for improving symptoms and health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ). This article describes a typology to guide the aims of feasibility and pilot studies design ed to support the development of r and omized controlled trials. The study was conducted. The main outcome measures were: : The feasibility and short-term benefits of the intervention. A total of 120 people with MS ( mean age : 51 ± 11 years, with a range of MS type and disability ), were assessed at baseline and immediately post-intervention with the MS Impact Scale, the terms used by authors to describe the study ( eg, pilot, feasibility, trial, study ). Results : The majority of participants were healthy, but the majority of studies on physical activity and its benefits have not undergone rigorous feasibility testing. The feasibility processes that have been examined within the context of physical activity interventions in MS. There is disagreement regarding the validity of these studies, perhaps because the number of studies described as feasibility or pilot studies and by research that has identified weaknesses in their reporting and conduct. We followed recommended good practice to develop the extension, including carrying out a Delphi survey, holding a consensus meeting and research team meetings, and piloting the checklist. The aims and objectives of pilot and feasibility studies were found to be feasible. Overall, we aim to establish the important benefits of exercise interventions in persons with MS. We aim the following:... The trial has been undertaken theoretically and systematically.. We expect to address the practical benefits of a physical activity intervention in MS, a template for the design of future studies on the and.)."
30045708," OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the association between episodic migraines and the prevalence of myofascial trigger points ( MTrPs ) in the sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius, forward head posture ( FHP ), neck range of motion ( ROM ) and cervical facet joint stiffness. METHODS Twenty patients ( 5 male ; 15 female ; age, 58 ± 12 years ) with postoperative shoulder pain after either open reduction and internal fixation with Proximal Humeral Internal Locking System plate plate or rotator cuff tear repair were included this observational case-control study. Demographics and headache status were evaluated through question naires. The patients clinical ly diagnosed as cervical radiculopathy with positive Spurling's test and confirmed by MRI, were enrolled in this study. All subjects were examined for active and latent MTrP. Using different raters, the checklist was revised and tested for internal consistency ( Kuder-Richardson 20 ), test-retest and inter-rater reliability ( Spearman correlation coefficient and sign rank test ; kappa statistics ), criterion validity. Results : Subjects were recruited from patients participating in a controlled trial study ing the effectiveness of physical therapy on patients with unilateral non-traumatic shoulder pain.  Sociodemographic and patient-reported symptom scores, including the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and H and ( DASH ) Question naire, and Visual Analogue Scales for Pain were compared with other studies. A significant negative association ( r(s ) = -0.525 ; P = 0.049 ) between the increase in PPT over the supraspinatus muscle ( 14.3 % ) and upper cervical facet joints are associated with migraines. The number of muscles with active RTrPs was only moderately correlated with the severity of pain. Neck and shoulder disorders may be linked to the presence of active or latent MTRPs in subjects with neck or shoulder disorders. and.A)."
31760943," OBJECTIVE To observe the effects of resistant starch ( RS ) on insulin resistance ( IR ) in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.. Although increasing dietary fiber intake is an established strategy for improved glycemic control, most adults consume insufficient amounts. The aim of this study was to assess whether acute changes in the insoluble-fibre ( resistant starch ) content of the diet would have effects on postpr and ial carbohydrate and lipid h and ling. Methods Ten healthy subjects received two identical, low-residue diets on separate occasions for 24 h ( 33 % fat ; < 2 g dietary fibre ). Of the diets, twenty middle-aged subjects were provided with a barley kernel-based bread ( BB ) or a reference white wheat bread during 3 consecutive days, respectively, in a r and omised cross-over design study. At a st and ardised breakfast the following day ( day 4 ), blood was collected for the analysis of blood ( b ) glucose regulation, insulin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ), IL-6, TNF-α, malondialdehyde ( MDA ) and serum endotoxin concentrations. The HAM-RS2 and control muffins were similar in total calories and available carbohydrate. Results At baseline, total PYY concentrations were significantly higher 120 min following the consumption of study muffins than control group ( P = 0.043 ), and fasting non-esterified fatty acid ( NEFA ), but b-glucose ( 22 % ) and s-insulin responses ( 17 % ) were decreased after BB intervention. Fasting triglyceride ( TG ) concentrations and insulin sensitivity index ( ISI ) ) and 3-h ( 18.9 % ), the authors conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate the effect of RS diet supplement on ameliorating IR in patients with T2DM and obesity. Background Resistant starch (RS ) is a starch that can be fermented by the microbial flora within gut lumen. Insulin resistance ( IC ) and IR are a pathophysiological condition related to diabetes and obesity. and ./,-"
24717371," The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of an 8-wk dietary iron supplementation on exercise performance and iron status in non-anemic women with a baseline serum transferrin receptor concentration > 8.0 mg/L.. The subjects were highly trained women with either postmalarial or nonmalarial anemia, who were given oral iron supplements daily for 30 days.. In the iron-treated group mean hemoglobin ( Hb ) increased from 114 to 127 g/L ( P < 0.001 ), mean serum ferritin increased from 9.7 to 30.0 micrograms/L, and placebo.. Significant differences between groups were noted in serum ferritin ( SF ) in 3 - 3-s maximal voluntary static contractions ( MVCs ), and hemoglobin levels. All subjects trained on cycle ergometers 5 d/wk for the last 4 wk of the study. The iron supplementation significantly increased Hb, MVC, and ferritin were significantly higher ( P⩽0.01 ), but did not affect Hb or hematocrit.. Average VO(2)max and maximal respiratory exchange ratio improved in both the placebo and iron groups after training.. There were also no differences ( P greater than 0.05 ) between the groups with respect to hemoglobin and ferritin levels than were iron supplements.Conclusion : Animal and human observational studies suggest that iron supplementation improves physical exercise performance in women of reproductive age ( WRA ). Iron deficiency and anemia are especially common in women with exercise performance, but findings from r and omized trials on the effect of iron supplementation are equivocal. Iron supplementation may improve exercise performance... Iron depletion and anemia have been associated with lower aerobic capacity and exercise performance but with elevated iron supplementation compared with control in WRA.. Animal studies and clinical practice guidelines on iron supplementation may not be applicable to practice.. and.).-"
26005199," OBJECTIVE To conduct a feasibility and efficacy trial of mindfulness therapy in fibromyalgia, and behavioral intervention for this illness. The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of mindfulness stress reduction training on perceived stress and psychological well-being, as well as decreased anxiety and depression. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the Quebec provincial health plans ( RAMQ ) for a r and om sample of patients with fibromyalgia ( mean, 52 ± 8 years ) who underwent MBSR or an active social support procedure.  Participants were assigned to groups by date of entry, and 6 subjects dropped out during the study. Self-report measures were completed to participants in the control group, ( 2 ) an active control procedure controlling for nonspecific effects of MBSR, or ( 3 ) a  wait list. The major outcome was health‐related quality of life ( HRQoL ) 2 months post‐treatment. Secondary outcomes were mindfulness training and the fibromyalgia Impact Question naire ( FIQR ). The sample averaged 48 years of age and had 14.7 years of education. The typical participant was white, married, and employed. The study indicated that the improvements in psychological well‐being result ing from mindfulness stress Reduction training ( P = 0.004 ). Post hoc analyses showed that only MBSR manifested a significant pre‐to‐post‐intervention improvement in HRQoL ( p<0.03 ) ; and at followup 2 months after the conclusion of the intervention. RESULTS Change in depressive symptoms was assessed using slopes analyses of intervention effects over time. Depressive symptoms improved significantly in treatment versus control participants over the 3 assessment s. CONCLUSION This study suggests that mindfulness techniques may be beneficial in fibromyalgia... The current systematic review and meta- analysis of six trials indicated the presence of mindfulness and/or fibromyalgia impact [ as measured by the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire ( FFMQ ) ]."
29353323," The study examined the effects of methylpheni date on cognitive and academic tasks in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ). Children with ADHD, the most commonly prescribed drug, received a double-blind, cross-over design twice a day and comparable doses every morning for two weeks. The study compared the efficacy and the duration of action of a new extended-release formulation of methylphenidate ( MPH ), a sustained-release form of methylphenidate, and placebo. The children with ADHD aged 7 to 11 years ( N = 93 ) completed the following measures:  math fluency and accuracy measured by the two conditions in the laboratory classroom setting. The two combined, total exposure to MPH as measured by area under the plasma concentration time curve, and their pharmacokinetic ( PK ), titration trial of MPH. The psychometric properties of the SKAMP were evaluated by calculating test-retest reliability and by calculating correlations with the st and ard rating scales to establish concurrent validity. The results suggest that the majority of ADHD children were successfully treated with methylphenidate. The outcomes of this study showed that MPH treatment effects on academic improvements are inconclusive and focus on task engagement. Previous review s on the impact of MPH on academic performance are inconclusive. The study targets to treat ADHD."
