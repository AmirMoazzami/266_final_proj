summarize conclusion:STUDY - BACKGROUND : The efficacy of varenicline is an effective and safe treatment for smoking cessation, but the safety of varenicline, a partial agonist at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, on smoking cessation. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of varenicline versus placebo in smoking cessation in patients with schizophrenia. The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial. Participants were enrolled to receive varenicline tartrate, placebo, or placebo for 12 weeks to quit smoking. The primary outcome was the cessation rate of varenicline ( 1 mg twice daily ) or placebo. Secondary outcomes included abstinence at weeks 0, 2, 6, 9, 12, and 52. At each visit, we administered varenicline or placebo to healthy subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to determine the effects of varenicline. The varenicline doses in the high-body-weight group were 1 mg BID and 0.5 mg BID, with 14 weeks follow-up. The mean age of participants were similar at baseline, those treated with varenicline were significantly less likely to report adverse events. At 12 weeks ( end of treatment ), the varenicline group was significantly higher for varenicline than for placebo, with no significant difference between placebo. The continuous abstinence rate at week 2 to 6 to the placebo group was 43.7 % versus 7.2 % ; odds ratio, 3.14 ; 95 % CI, 1.93 to 5.11 ). The smoking cessation rates were similar between varenicline and placebo, while the relapse rate was higher in varenicline compared with placebo. No serious adverse events were observed in varenicline treatment versus placebo.. The oral varenicline group versus placebo was well tolerated and the risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events was not significantly different between the 2 groups.A/.}-).VC..
