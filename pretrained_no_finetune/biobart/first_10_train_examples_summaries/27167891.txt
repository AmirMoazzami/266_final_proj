summarize conclusion:STUDY - INTRODUCTION Tobacco use in low- to middle-income countries is a major public health concern for both smokers and those exposed to environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ). The analysis was split into two halves – baseline study taken up prior to implementation of the said ban on 2nd October 2008, and the follow-up study after it came into effect. Material s and Methods : Twenty-five venues including five restaurants, fourteen resto-bars, two hookah ( smoking water-pipe ) cafes and four pubs were selected using a mix of r and om, convenience and purpose ful sampling. The trial originally recruited 1,955 adult smokers with suspected tuberculosis from 33 health centers in the Jhang and Sargodha districts of Pakistan between 2010 and 2011. The primary endpoint was continuous 6-month smoking abstinence, which was determined by carbon monoxide levels. In order to underst and reasons for non-permission, interviews with parents were conducted. Phone numbers of parents were requested from the school administration ; 12 of  the 40 schools ( 30 % ) agreed to provide the contact information. A r and Om sample of 28 parents from 12 schools was interviewed to reach data saturation. In a meta- analysis, higher odds of waterpipe tobacco smoking were found among males ( Adjusted odds ratio [ AOR ] = 1.37, 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] =1.18 % to 1.59 % ), cigarette users ( AOR = 6.95, 95 percent CI = 1,3 - 3.8 ). A similar pattern was observed for cigarette-only smokers at baseline ( RR = 2.0 ; 95 % CI = 0.9, 1.82 ). We systematic ally review the literature, including and.}).. ) "."}.
