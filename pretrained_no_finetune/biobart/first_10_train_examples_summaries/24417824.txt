summarize conclusion:STUDY - Background : Postoperative hyperglycemia is associated with postoperative insulin resistance. We studied the effect of preoperative carbohydrate loading. The effect of this treatment on postoperative recovery. The study was conducted to determine the role of postoperative carbohydrate loading on postoperative insulin sensitivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS Insulin resistance and glucose turnover ( [ 6, 6,(2)H(2)]-D-glucose ) were measured using a carbohydrate-rich drink ( 400 ml ). The patients undergoing a hepatectomy for the treatment of a hepatic neoplasm were r and omly assigned to receive either a placebo drink or carbohydrate ( 12.6g/100ml ) drink ( CHOD ). Patients were classified into two sequential groups : the control group included 968 patients treated with sliding-scale-guided intermittent subcutaneous insulin injections ( SQI ), and the study group included 31 patients who underwent surgery. The visual analog scale scores in a control group were not different between groups. The 2 groups of patients were well matched, with similar age, sex, race, prevalence of diabetes mellitus, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, and distribution of diagnoses. There were no differences between the 2 groups. In both studies, the mean glucose value decreased from 152.3 to 130.7 mg/dL ( P < 0.05 ). Postoperative recovery was significantly higher in the CHO group.. and.
