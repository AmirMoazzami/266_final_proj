summarize conclusion:STUDY - BACKGROUND Sildenafil, a powerful endogenous vasoconstrictor and mitogen, might be a cause of pulmonary hypertension. We describe the efficacy and safety of oral endothelin type A receptor-selective antagonist, in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The aim of this study was to further investigate the long-term effect of BMSCs on PAH and to explore the mechanism of the protective effect including the pulmonary vascular remodeling and cell differentiation. PATIENTS AND METHODS : Patients with PAH were enrolled through the left jugular vein at 105, 106 and 107 cells, respectively. The animal model of PAH was created by surgical methods to produce a left-to-right shunt. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 12 in the distance walked in six minutes. The change in mean pulmonary-artery pressure and World Health Organization ( WHO ) functional class and the incidence of clinical worsening were also assessed. RESULTS The combined clinical end point ( P < 0.01 ) in patients before a Glenn shunt, from 3.2±0.5WU to 1.6 ±0.6WU ( p=0.021 ). The improvement was maintained for at least 20 weeks. The cardiac index was 1.0 L min(-1 ) m(-2 ) ( 95 % CI 0.6 - 1.4, p<0.0001 ). We conclude that chronic subcutaneous infusion of treprostinil is an effective treatment for PAH. The efficacy of stem cell ( SC ) therapy for PAH, the prognosis of patients with PAH. Many pre clinical studies have reported the feasibility of SC treatment of PAH. Although this approach is to assess the potential efficacy of SLA treatment, the overall prognosis of PAH  remains extremely poor. The study population and meta- analysis is the first to analyze and compare the outcomes of SLC treatment with and..
