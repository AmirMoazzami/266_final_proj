summarize conclusion:STUDY - OBJECTIVE To identify determinants of sexual adjustment by persons with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) and quality of the relationship compared with persons in the general population. DESIGN Controlled survey. SETTING Postdischarge community setting. PARTICIPANTS A consecutive series of 252 persons admitted to our spinal unit between November 1982 and July 1991 with traumatic SCI were contacted, 85 of whom persons were excluded : 36 were dead, 37 had recovered, 5 could not be located, 4 were younger than 18 years, 2 had language difficulties, and 1 had a psychiatric illness. Of the remaining 167 persons with SCI, 85 had a stable partner relationship, 75 of whom ( 88 % ) completed and returned the question naires ( median age, 33 years ; range 19 to 76 ). Co- primary end points were the change from baseline, averaged over the double-blind treatment period, for Ashworth score ( bilateral knee flexors and extensors ) and a 7-point Subject Global Impression of treatment ( SGI ). The ROC analysis differentiated between SD and non-SD patients ( p < 0.001 ).. The cutoff point of ASEX-Thai at â‰¥16 points effectively screened for SD ( sensitivity 96.2 %, specificity 92.9 % ). Reliability was documented with the Cronbach's alpha of all items at baseline and at a 2-month follow-up with values of 0.948 and 0.962 respectively. The Pearson's correlation also showed highly significant test-retest reliability [ Item 1 ( r = 0.959 ), ISI, and FSFI subscale change scores correlated with Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Question naire International Urogynecological Association-revised ( PISQ-IR ) ]. The between-treatment difference was not significant for any identified PROM.
