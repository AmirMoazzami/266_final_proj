summarize conclusion:STUDY - OBJECTIVES The aim of this prospect i ve clinical study was to evaluate the clinical performance of three-unit zirconia fixed dental prostheses ( FDPs )  made from the same ceramic. All 65 FDPs were inserted at the Department of Prosthodontics, Ivoclar Vivadent, Kiel, Germany. The patients were evaluated in a prospect i t study from a minimum of 6 months to a maximum of 60 months. The restorations were placed in the anterior ( 16 % ) and posterior ( 84 % ) regions. All teeth were evaluated the restorations were evaluated using a st and ardized protocol. The survival rate was determined with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method. The scores of gingival condition were compared between the test ( abutments ) and control ( contralateral ). The outcomes were analyzed using the modified United States Public Health Service ( USPHS ) criteria. The following parameters were evaluated at baseline, 6 months after cementation and then annually ( at abutment and tooth-level ). Statistical analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, test and two-year follow-up. The success rate was 100 % for crowns, and 70 % for the remaining restorations. The cumulative survival rates after 5 years were 91.9 % for anterior crowns and 87.7 % for posterior ones. The mean observation period was three years, the mean observation time was 79.5 months ( range 11 - 15 years ).. The main reasons for failure were lost restorations ( 18 ), ceramic fracture ( 16 ), and secondary caries ( 11 ). Significant differences in failure rate were observed between  the ceramic restorations and non-ceramic restorations. Five-year survival and complication rates of these restorations were similar to those of traditional single crowns..A). and.
