summarize conclusion:STUDY - Background : While warfarin-related intracranial hemorrhage ( ICH ) occurs in 0.25%-1.1 % patients per year, the balance between the benefits and risks of restarting OAC is unclear. The decision to restart OAC or to start antiplatelet therapy in these patients therefore poses a dilemma for all physicians involved. We assessed the long-term outcome of patients with Fisher Grade 3 aSAH due to rupture of a supratentorial aneurysm who presented within 36 hours and were treated by surgical clipping within 48 hours of their ictus. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients discharged from our institution after OAC-associated ICH over a 10-year period. Data on the use of OAC or platelet inhibitors and the occurrence of vascular events during follow-up were assessed through question naires and patient files. The primary outcome was recurrent fatal or non-fatal stroke. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of other haemorrhagic, thrombotic or thromboembolic events. With patients without antithrombotic treatment as reference. In the heparin group, activated partial thromboplastin times were normal to mildly elevated ; no clinical ly significant hemorrhages or instances of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or deep vein thrombosis were encountered. In contrast to the control group. The overall risk of a thromthrombo-embolic complication can be estimated to be 0.66 events/1000 patient-days at risk ( 95 % exact confidence limits of 0.3 to 1.3 events/ 1000 patient-years at risk ). In addition, the recurrent strokes occurred during 35.4 patient-months without anticoagulation treatment ( 6.8 % ] and 3.32 [ 1-year, P = 0.003 ] ). We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to summarize the subsequent risk of ICH recurrence and thrombus..A). andÂ
