summarize conclusion:STUDY - BACKGROUND Primary pulmonary hypertension is a progressive disease for which no treatment has been shown in a prospect i ve, r and omized trial to improve survival. By causing the pulmonary artery to dilate, inhaled nitric oxide ( NO ) may allow an increase in exercise capacity in patients with PH. A frequent complication of CTD is pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ), which has a major effect on functioning and quality of life. Data captured included demographics, PAH aetiology, baseline functional status and concomitant PAH-specific medications. Safety signals captured included death, hospitalisation, serious adverse events, unexpected adverse events and elevated aminotransferases. Within 30 months, 4,994 patients were included, representing 79 % of patients receiving bosentan in Europe. In total, 44,623 patients were naïve to treatment ; of these, 352 had elevated amiotransferase , corresponding to a crude incidence of 7.6 % and an annual rate of 10.1 %. Hemodynamics improved at 12 weeks in the epoprostenol-treated patients. The changes in mean pulmonary-artery pressure for the EPO and control groups were -8 percent and the same rate of the 6-min walk test. In both studies and their extensions, survival was assessed from start of treatment to death or data cut-off and analysed as Kaplan – Meier estimates.
