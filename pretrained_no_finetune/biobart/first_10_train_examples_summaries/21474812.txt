summarize conclusion:STUDY - Background and Purpose : Prediction models are used to assess the prognosis of stroke patients with acute ischemic stroke. The role of prognostic factors in the early phase after stroke is not robust. The results of the present study were compared with those of a cohort study. The study was designed to determine the predictive value of baseline characteristics of patients with the following outcomes. The cohort study was therefore included to identify predictors of functional recovery ( Barthel Index ) at 6 months after stroke. Patients ( N=382 ) with baseline DWI data from the R and omized Trial of Tirilazad Mesylate in Acute Stroke ( RANTES ). At 6 months, the six variables were collected at r and omisation. The predictive model based on these factors predicted functional outcome with an overall accuracy of 67 % and mortality with an accuracy of 83 %. The final models of binary logistic regression analyses were constructed. The baseline NIHSS score was predictive of outcome, and the subscores of gait speed and balance were predictive of outcomes.. The model predicts the outcome of interest. The outcomes of interest were the Barthel Index, which was predictive than the baseline value. The prognostic factors for outcome were identified to be age, gender, and stroke severity. The score of these variables were predictive to the 6-month outcome. The study shows that the prognostic factors that predict outcome of stroke after the first week after stroke are predictive ( p = 0.002 ), but the model is not predictive for outcome of ADL. The method ological quality of predicting outcomes after stroke diagnosis and treatment is limited. The classification of outcomes of stroke is a valid clinical assessment tool that identifies patients with high probability of recovery after stroke.. The acronym of.AOCR+/C90)-)..
