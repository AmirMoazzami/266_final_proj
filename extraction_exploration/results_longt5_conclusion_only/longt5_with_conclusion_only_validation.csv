26762372,"This paper focuses on the protective role of alpha carotenine in atheroscomatose disease and suggests that it may be useful as a preventive measure against this disease. It also discusses the association between blood levels of both alpha and beta-carotenoids, suggesting that these two are important risk factors for early atheogenesis. In addition, studies have suggested that higher concentrations of carotenoidene appear to be associated with reduced risk of heart attack in older men. Furthermore, smoking seems to increase the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by impairing insulin action and leading to an increased susceptibility to type 2 disease. These results suggest that consumption of high-quality foods such as fruits and vegetables may help lower the risks of cardiovascular disease."
28723736,"In this paper, Caius uses a case-control study to assess the efficacy of an extended course of cefaziin in preventing streptomyctomies. He concludes by stating that cefacin has a shorter half-life and therefore is prudent to administer it close to the wound as much as possible. The results suggest that Cefazin should be given more than two hours before the surgery for patients who have no detectable caesal wound infection. However, there is no specific recommendation for prolonging the treatment. A recent randomized trial suggests that prophylaxes should be delivered between 75 and 30 minutes before surgical site infection. This does not predict a significant reduction in the risk of severe scarlet syphilis."
22002191,"Conclusions In this paper, we present the results of a prospective observational study on patients who had undergone abdominal surgery with an extended recovery period. This was followed by a detailed description of the outcome of each patient's post-opportunity and their subsequent follow-up. The authors conclude that ""nipporical ventilation may be more suitable for selected patients with acute scarlet fever"" than conventional ventilation in these patients. They conclude that deep breathing exercises are superior to physical therapy when combined with early mobilization after chest resection. However, they do not report any significant changes in lung function at the fourth day of surgery. Their main conclusion is that preoperative exercise does not improve lung function but only improves it during the later stages of the surgery."
31921439,"High intensity interval training is superior to moderate intensity aerobic training in reducing IHL and Non-Adopatra's risk of developing Type 2D. In this paper, we describe the results of an eight-week exercise program consisting of four weeks of high intensity intermittent swimming followed by two weeks of short-term restorative exercise. The results indicate that all-exceeding interval training can be used as an alternative strategy to improve physical health in older adults. However, it is not safe for young adults with normal blood lipid levels because they do not have adequate body mass."
30301735,"In this paper, the authors present a cost-effectiveness analysis of two different approaches to treating patients with chronic tendinopathy: 1) topical glucamine and 2) an eccentric exercise program. They conclude that both approaches are ineffective because of the large number of adverse events that led them to ab or on treatment. However, they use a model to predict how much money will be needed to fund these studies."
24752440,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of physical activity on bone mineralization in preterm and very low-birth-women infants. He concludes that exercise is as effective as a therapist's intervention in improving bone strength in early-preterm infants because it improves both body weight and bone mass. He also discusses the use of passive exercises to promote bone growth in prematurely ill children."
31731772,"This paper focuses on the effects of soy-based peptides on weight loss in overweight and obesity-abcomparable subjects. It concludes that soy can be used as an aid in weight management because it is high in polyunstained fat, fiber, vitamins, and minerals."
29219090,"In this paper, Wu et al. concludes that physical activity can improve motor skills in pre-school children but does not prevent weight gain or increase in body mass index. Children with higher levels of physical activity are less likely to develop deformed necks and may be at risk of developing deformed skulls."
29102433,"Conclusions The use of a daily dose of 500 IU of vitamin D did not improve the outcome of patients with typhoid disease, but the trial showed that it could be insufficient. A weekly dose was sufficient to improve bone growth and reduced the risk of serious morbidity among young low-birth weight infants. This conclusion does not satisfy the need for further study. Four monthly high-dosevitamin D supplementation prevented fractures without negative effects in men or women living in general community. In postmenopauseal women, daily treatment with 800 IU/day of vitaminD did not reduce all-type malignancy at four years. Further studies are needed to determine the role of this intervention in preventive medicine."
30237020,"In this chapter, we summarize the latest evidence on the efficacy and drawbacks of various forms of treatment for peyronie disease. The most promising is transdermal electricmotive drug delivery. Conclusions This study suggests that Intrlesional Interferon-Alpha-2B therapy may be an appropriate approach for some selected patients with peyirone's disease who fail to respond to conventional methods of treatment. Moreover, larger studies need to be performed to assess the effects of this newer form of therapy on the patient's condition. Conscious that more studies are needed, conclusively, we conclude that IVIV has a favorable effect on reduction of penile disvalve deformity as well as improved sexual function in men with paternal disease. Iontophorsis of Dexamethaone, Liocaine, and Verapammil may be considered first line non surgical treatment for Paternal Disease. A double blinded, placebo controlled study is under development; however, it does not seem to be highly effective in treating early stage disease. Collagenases Clostridial Histolyticum appears to have a positive effect on improving"
29043156,"In this paper, we examine the social relationships of children with and without an idgy disorder in order to determine whether or not there is a relationship between ASD's social anxiety and the development of other school-affairs. We conclude that although 48.1 percent of these children are involved in their social networks, they are likely isolated or peripheral from other students within the classroom. Children with ASD appear to be less connected to peers in later grade levels than those who do not have such a disorder. This suggests that early intervention may be important for preventing further social isolation among children with an unidentified disorder."
22161422,"In this paper, the effects of a two-year course of behavior therapy on children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder are examined. Although there is little evidence for the efficacy of this combination treatment, it does improve symptoms and school performance in children with ADHD."
31729817,"This paper concludes that the protective effect of a high-dose of vitamin D, combined with an appropriate amount of exercise, may be sufficient to prevent saropenia from resulting in excessive fracture risk. In this study, we find no evidence for a significant increase in muscle strength or mobility after 12 months of treatment with alcalcitol. We conclude that it is more effective at improving back and leg strength in older women who are deficient in both their bone turnover markers and their physical function. Furthermore, these results suggest that ""calcitriol"" and calcium should be used as anti-sarpinia treatments since they have been found to be more effective than other forms of treatment. However, there is little evidence for any beneficial effect of either type of treatment on falls. Finally, we conclude that long-term use of high-dose chole calculiferol does not lead to improved fall outcomes."
31541679,Conclusions Percutaneous atrial balloon ablation is a safe and effective treatment for patients with acute scarlet ailment.
17253498,"In this paper, we describe the effect of a combination of hg and ox on girls with Turner's disease. The results suggest that GH treatment can lead to an increase in height for most patients with the condition. For example, subjects with a mean height of 152.3cm gain from GH alone or combined with OX show significant increases in their adult height. This suggests that a higher dose of GH may be more effective in terms of increasing height velocity in children with Turner Syndrome."
17705840,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of nine randomized controlled trials of antisterogans in patients with oligotspermis. We test the hypocrisy of using poor-quality studies to predict the efficacy of these treatments in bipolar and other psychiac patients. A majority of the studies found no significant improvement in patient satisfaction or quality of life after six months of treatment. Bipolar I disorder is more severe than mixed-episciple disorder, but only some patients were able to maintain their remission for an average of seven months. This suggests that BPD may not be as severe as it was previously thought."
31066022,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the effects of a memory task on balance in patients with chronic ankle instability. It does not change postural performance for subjects with low pain or disability. After ACL reconstruction, there is an increase in injury rates over two years. Postural control is improved by increasing the intensity of one's attention to the suprapostural task."
28427968,"This paper presents the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study of patients with acute atrial fistia. It shows that patentary fever is associated with lower risk of stroke than sustained feigning a stroke in patients with few risk factors. In addition, there is an improvement in use of OAC among Chinese patients recently treated with AF. However, variations between hospitals are large and suggest that better knowledge and awareness need to be needed to improve treatment for these patients. Conclusions In this large Japanese population, the highest rate of stroke event was seen in those with a History of Stroke. A further improvement in OAC use has been observed in several years but only 36.5 percent of patients received it. Atrial Fibrillation was relatively frequently in elderly Chinese people, poorly managed; therefore, one needs to pay more attention especially in the fields of treatment."
28699771,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of a large-scale, long-term prospective observational study that describes the efficacy and safety of non-operative management of patients with acutely painful appendicetis. We conclude that it is feasible to perform ""nonoperative management"" of these patients without risking significant morbidity or cost. Conscious and Rouvalance When chosen by their family, outpatient treatment can be performed quickly and safely. Antibiotic therapy in patients suffering from acute appendicotis does not result in significant complications; however, those treated with conventional treatment do not have significant complications."
25809923,"A randomized, double-blind study comparing the effects of three different treatment regimens on pain and quality of life in women with chronic endometriasis. The most promising trial is an open-label, random-electrified group of patients who receive no treatment after their initial symptoms return. In contrast, six patients receive only one or two doses of Gabaptantin alone. This results in a significant improvement in pain scores for both groups. After 1 year's follow-up, gosterelin remains superior toMPA as an objective assessment of pain. Laparoscopic surgery reduces pain but does not improve patient satisfaction. Estradiol increases pain by reducing the severity of lesions associated with deependometrioses. Postoperative hormonal suppressing treatment or  diet therapy are more efficacious than surgery plus pill to obtain relief from pain caused by interstitial Cysitis. Conclusions Intravesical Tie BCG is safer and effective in the treating of interstiital cystitis; however, there are some drawbacks: it needs only one doctor every 5 years for its use. Both methods work well in the treatmentof CPP-afflic"
31189669,"Conclusions This paper presents the results of a randomized, double-blind, single-arm study on the safety and efficacy of Cf-guided percutaneous atrial balloon ablation. In particular, it suggests that using a combination of cryoblation and cynically guided balloon technology may be more effective than conventional methods in reducing post-procedure time and improving patient safety."
25268297,"In this paper, the authors present a meta-analysis of 370 random drug trials. They conclude that the experimental drug is recommended for treatment of choice amongst three main groups: 1) donations; 2) for-profit; and 3) non-profit. These results suggest that ""industry-funded trials may be associated with significant proindustries"" in these studies."
31685858,"Conclusions In this paper, we present the results of a meta-analysis on the efficacy of methylphini date in children with mild-to-diseased or intellectually retarded onset of both attention and hyperactivity disorder. We conclude that it is not possible to completely treat all children with these conditions; however, we do suggest that some children may be better able to manage their symptoms without medication."
28886707,"In this paper, the authors present evidence for a possible association between consumption of sugary soft drinks and increased risk of Type 2 Diabetes. They conclude that drinking sweetened beverages is not associated with elevated risk of T1D but rather with reduced risk of weight gain in overweight children. The results further support the notion that artificially sweeteners can be used as an anti-diabetic agent. Furthermore, they suggest that diet sodas may increase blood glucose levels. Consuming either type of sweetener reduces overall energy intake without affecting other nutrients. A higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes is seen among women who consume more than one serving of sweetened soft drink per day. This suggests that there may be a need to test the effects of Nns on body weight."
22710280,Conclusions This paper focuses on the use of the ERAS-proposal to improve patient outcomes following colorecian colonic surgery. The results suggest that a multimodal approach may be more effective than conventional approaches for post-opportunity and recovery.
24869750,"In this paper, the results of a prospective, open-label, random-experimentation study are presented. The main conclusion is that no significant changes in total cholesterol or lipoprotein levels were observed between the two therapy groups. No significant differences in side effects were noted; however, there was a significant increase in blood pressure reduction in the combined treatment group. This suggests that alskiren may be an effective choice for long-term hypertension. Alskiren also reduces blood pressure by reducing the amount of time it takes to achieve a target blood pressure value."
26659821,"In this paper, Conners et al. concludes by comparing the efficacy and safety of an eight-month treatment program for children with severe autistic symptoms to that of a control group. Children receiving the intervention outperform their mothers and fathers in terms of intelligence, language, daily living skill, and positive social behavior. The results suggest that ""intensive"" treatment is superior to parent training for improving child's well-being. A 20-week parental education program provides significant gains in child adaptive behavior and symptoms of Autistic disorder for low-fisted children. For children with moderate-to-diseased autism, a 24-week parent training regimen was superior to parents education; however, the rate of positive respond judged by blinded physicians was greater for parenting training versus parent education. Parents who received the additional intervention were more likely to report improved behavior than those who did not receive the intervention."
28235776,"This paper presents the results of a large-scale, long-term, observational study of the use of text messages to improve health behavior in patients with acute coronary disease. The main outcome of the study is the identification of the most effective intervention for reducing the risk of sudden death from a myocardial infarction."
29340748,"Conclusions The use of polyurethane cloths before shoulder surgery may reduce the risk of complications. A national surgical registry is used to identify patients who have undergone shoulder arthrocoplasty in four different body mass categories: normal, overweight, obesity class 1 or greater, and obesity class 2 or greater. In this study, we find no association between body mass and post-surgery complications among different body size groups. We conclude that there are no significant differences in patient morbidity after TSA for patients with higher body mass."
29935874,"In this paper, the effects of exposure to Naocl on the strength of two root filling materials are examined. MTA and EarrMF have a higher pushout bond strength than either sealer or cement. The use of PBS as an irrigation system improves the bond strength in both groups. Conclusions These results suggest that it would be useful for perforation repairs to single-visit endodontic treatments."
19902985,"This paper focuses on the effects of vigorous exercise on women's health. It concludes that vigorous exercise can induce changes in both menstrual function and body composition. Women with pre-diabetes should be rechecked for Type 2 diabetes over time, but it is unclear whether this interval will last longer than several years."
23160338,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of two recent studies. First, we report that atorvastain does not lead to a reduction in the risk of atrial fillation after cagb surgery. Second, we conclude that it is necessary to use larger numbers of patients to determine whether or not statins can prevent this development. Third, we present an analysis of several large-scale multi-centre international cohorts of patients who have been treated with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer drugs. We conclude that there are some evidence of beneficial effects of rosurvastatin as a preventive measure for atrial fibrilation. Finally, we describe a prospective observational study using a large population of patients from across the world. This study suggests that treatment with alpha-blockers, ace inhibitors, and nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory drugs may protect against atrial Fibrillation. Next, we examine the effect of pre-elective cardiac surgery on the rate of post-eventual AF following elective cardioversion. Acute coronary disease is associated with significant complications. Short-term administration of atorvarstatin reduces the early"
17210875,"The results of this study indicate that weight loss may be an effective intervention to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in older, obese women. In contrast, a scathing diet does not lead to any significant changes in blood pressure or body fat. However, it does lead to improvements in several other important risk-factors. These include elevated HbA1c levels and elevated lipoprotein concentrations. This suggests that high-fat diets may be more successful in reducing these risk factors than their low-fat counterparts."
29450937,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, randomized, and a controlled study on the efficacy of retro-grade filling material for root-end healing. We conclude that MTA, IRM, amalgam, Super EBA, Epiphany Resilon, and GMTA have similar marginal adaption to root end filling materials. However, they do not show any significant differences in the long-term success rates of either material."
23839768,"In this paper, the authors systematically examine the efficacy and safety of two different approaches to anticoagulation in patients with heart-valve prostheses. They conclude that warfarin and aspirin are more effective at preventing post-embolic bleeding than either regimen alone. However, there is a significant difference in the incidence of major bleeding episodes between the two treatment groups. Conclusions The combined treatment reduces the risk of major blood embolic events but does not increase the rate of minor bleeding. A further study is necessary to determine whether additional treatments can be used to prevent future complications."
26691216,"This paper presents the results of a prospective, randomized, open-label, single-blind, controlled trial of an evidence-based lifestyle intervention to improve patients' blood pressure control. It concludes that ""if successful in optiming bp control, managing other chest disease risk factors and demonstrating lower cost,"" the web-based approach could be useful as a primary preventive measure against heart disease. However, it does not show any significant effect on improving physical activity or quality of care for patients with chronic disease. The main drawback is that there are few exercise-only trials. In addition, many studies have found no effect on patient health. For example, one study showed no improvement in self-reported adherence to prescribed risk-reducing strategies when telemedicine was used. A further study showed that using a phone-based program to reduce post-MI symptoms did not lead to improvements in overall health."
16625624,"In this chapter, Anderson focuses on the effects of physical activity on bone mineralization in young girls. He discusses the association between alcohol and total carbonated beverages; however, these are not associated with increased risk of fracture in children. The effect of calcium-supplementation seems to be limited by habitual caloric consumption. Although there is some evidence that it may have long-lasting effects on Gambian children, further studies need to be performed. Calcium-extracted milk appears to increase bone mineral acquisition during early adulthood but does not lead to significant increases in bone mineral accumulation later in life. This study concludes that both obstructive and habitual diets can influence bone mineral acquire. A daily 500 milligram Ca/d for 10 months increases bone mineral content in healthy females."
29188577,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights focuses on the effects of exercise on balance, gaitability, and strength in older adults. He concludes that a high intensity functional exercise program can have long-term positive effects on these subjects. The results suggest that an exercise program improves both physical and mental health in older persons who are physically frail. Acute restorative exercise is also effective in reducing falls risk among frail elderly."
24798429,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the effects of telephone-based follow-up for patients with acute coronary disease who have not yet been admitted to the hospital. He concludes that ""patient-centered modular prevent significantly improves chesty risk profile"" in comparison with traditional care. The results of this study suggest that phone-based intervention may be an effective strategy for reducing typhoid scarlet fever and improving quality of life among patients with severe chronic heart disease."
28462286,"The AlereNet heart failure patient management system reduces the primary endpoint of re hospitalization for patients with severe heart failure by improving quality of life, reduced readmissions, and improved survival. A nurse-led intervention improves short-term self-care behavior in patients with acute heart failure. Short-term followup is needed to confirm this effect. Nurse-led education increases family members' knowledge about heart failure; however, it does not improve long-term health outcomes."
24253135,"In this paper, the authors present an evidence-based approach to perioperative nutrition for patients following major abdominal surgery. They conclude that enteral feeding is safe and can be used as a primary therapy in patients with high risk of complications. A randomized controlled study is needed to determine whether enteral feeds are more effective than parenteral or enteral food. The results indicate that Enteral feeding improves post-opportunity and length of stay but do not lead to significant increases in complications. Post-Oppose Complications Per Patient: 1.4 x 2.1 vs 3.9 x 7.05, P = 0.05, respectively. Pre-Operative Gastric Muscle Function: Epidural Analgesis With Local Anaestry and Optically improves Quality of Oesphagectomy compared with PSA in patients who undergo major thosoabdomular surgery. Conclusions That enteral fed via a jejunal tube was safe and improved pain relief without adverse psychological outcome. However, it provided no benefit over Intrvenous hydrate only for patients after ecsophagoplasty. There were no differences in mor"
29517050,"In this first observational study, the safety and efficacy of percutaneous laabectomy in patients with previously ICH are established. Although there is a tendency for a higher risk of stroke in those treated with OAC or warfarin, long-term follow-up is needed to determine the most appropriate regimen. This trial will involve 300 patient years of follow up. Warfarin does not increase the risk of severe haematoma but may reduce its severity. Conclusions that older age and greater consumption of alcohol seem independent determinant of outcome after Intrcerebralebral Hemorrhage; these results make it possible for prognostics to be given to patients with ""lobar intracerrebral bleeding."""
22708573,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effectiveness of three different types of case management services in improving clients' adjustment. The first is to use multiple regression strategies to analyze the effects of case manager intervention on client satisfaction and quality of life. These results suggest that case management can be used as a stand-alone approach to treating people with serious mental illnesses. For example, patients who receive more than five minutes of their case manager's time are significantly more likely to attend treatment than those who receive less than 5 minutes. This study supports the need for ""formal case management"" in providing community care for individuals with severe mental illness. A case management program is particularly effective when compared to an all-in-one approach: therapists, day treatment workers, and hospital staff. It also improves consumers' self-efficacy in achieving specific community goals such as increasing personal income or maintaining physical health."
21464190,"In this first randomized, controlled trial, we demonstrate that a comprehensive, evidence-based treatment for children with mild to moderately severe ASD is safe and effective. We conclude that the ""behavior treatment group"" shows significant gains in language, social skills, and self-reported well-being after two years of treatment. However, there are still some concerns about the long-term effects of the intervention on parents and children."
31478020,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft discusses the potential of a patient-based fee-for-fee program to improve primary care in India. It's unclear whether it will be more cost effective to implement a system that rewards patients for their use of services rather than rewards them for using them. We conclude that there are some drawbacks to this approach: 1) informal medical training does not lead to improved case management; 2) formal medical training doesn't lead to better practice; and 3) multi-topic medical training isn't as effective as other forms of training. For example, one study suggests that ""integral management of childhood illness training"" can improve infant survival but fails to improve maternal health. The paternal immci intervention has no significant effect on neonatal mortality."
32196906,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a pilot study that showed some support for early post-surgical dietary counseling. There were significant improvements in leg presse strength and leg extension strength after resistance training. The intervention group improved muscular strength but not illicit changes from FFM or Muscle cross sectional area in patients who undergone Rouxen-Y Gastric Bypass surgery. Preoperative lifestyle counseling seemed to improve physical health; however, there were no significant differences in weight loss between the two groups. This is important because it has cost implications for the national health system as well as for the other medical care provided by the surgeons. Conclusions A behavior lifestyle intervention with severely overweight individuals lead to clinically significant weight Loss Prior to Bariatric Surgery. Post surgical follow up will allow you to examine the effect of the preoperative intervention on posturgiesm outcomes. This has Cost Implications for the National and other Healthcare Providers as improved effectiveness Of bariaric surgery reducesthe health costs of obesity patients in the long term. Concliusions A psychological lifestyle intervention for severe overweight individuals leadsto clinically substantial weight loss Prior to bariatic surgery. Postsurgery follows up will enable us to"
24628781,"In this paper, Conlausions focuses on the use of statin therapy as an effective treatment for men who have erectilial dysfunction. He concludes by describing the results of a pilot study in which subjects received no improvement in their quality of life after prostatectomy and that further studies are needed to confirm whether or not statins can be used as an anti-erectile medicine."
25601182,"Walking is an effective and cost-effective form of exercise for improving health in older adults. The results suggest that walking can be used as a preventative measure against heart disease, stroke, and other long-term consequences. However, there are no significant changes in blood pressure or body weight after the intervention."
22059801,"Conclusions This paper provides further evidence that the core recommendations of the Acracris and Omeract, which are not disease specific, are suitable for a wide range of rheusmatic conditions. However, it is necessary to distinguish between patient-oriented measures and disease-specific measures in order to make informed decisions about treatment."
29223954,"In patients with high-risk hypercholestrolemia who are not statin-tolerant, alirobumab significantly reduces the risk of developing Type 2 or Type 3 disease by reducing the concentration of acylphospholipids in the blood. The safety and efficacy of this regimen are not yet clear; however, it does lead to improved long-term results."
20507592,"The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of physical activity counseling in promoting health in older adults with Type 2 and other chronic disease. It was found that walking at moderate intensity was as effective as regular exercise for improving blood pressure, glycemia, and mood in patients with type 2 who were not physically active. This paper concludes by concluding that ""implering a neighborhood walk program of low-to-mode intensity is feasible"" and beneficial for senior residents at community level. Conclusions: First, it is possible to use surveillance of lifestyle habits into national systems; second, it may be more accurate to accurately represent the frequency of recommended weekly physical activity. Third, there are no significant differences between the two groups at either follow-up visit. Finally, these results suggest that walking short bouts of moderate intensity can improve long term health outcomes in people with age-related heart disease. Conscious of the need for future research, we recommend using a Pedometer as a tool to promote walking."
19403634,"Young adults in northern Irel do not consume adequate daily  diets to maintain their vitamin D levels in the winter. A daily supply of 15 ng.d. increases their serum 25hhD levels, but does not affect bone mineral concentrations. Conclusions In elderly patients with low blood levels of vitamin D, this suggests that they may be at greater risk of developing fractures than those with higher levels. These conclusions are based on a three-year observational study. The results suggest that young adults who have inadequately nourished their bodies can benefit from a daily dose of 10 nmol.e.m."
29961021,"This paper focuses on the use of machine-learning approaches to classify patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, hypertension, and Irritated Heart disease in Turkish primary care. The majority of these patients are not well controlled; they have a high frequency of complications. In addition, there is a need for improved patient education in order to reduce the epidemic of abdominal obesity in Turkey."
25348235,"Six of eight subjects report Micturition difficulties at a concentration of 12.8mg. To determine whether Cyp2D6 is involved in toltersodine's pharmacology, this study compares the effects of two different morphine metabolites: one that is more active than the other, and another that is less active. The efficacy of both regimens seems to be similar for patients with bladder overactive symptoms. Both are well tolerated; however, they do have some side effects. Conclusions In this paper, we review the evidence for the use of solifenacin as an overactive bladder treatment."
23635412,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study of patients with mild-to-senile Alzheimer's disease. We conclude that there are sufficient evidence for recommending a general ""healthy lifestyle"" including physical exercise, healthy nutrition, smoking cesation, and mental stimuli. Furthermore, we present a follow-up study in which all patients were followed from one year to the next. This provides us with an opportunity to compare treatment adherence over time and to identify changes in patient condition over time."
26094664,"Laparoscopic weight loss surgery is an effective intervention for patients with Type 2 diabetes. Post-surgery results in significant weight loss and improved health quality of life after one year. Although psychological support does not have a significant impact on weight reduction, it is believed that this may be due to the fact that patients lose more weight during their follow-up period than they do after surgery. In addition, gastric bypass has a favorable effect on blood pressure, cholesterol, and weight loss. This paper discusses the pros and cons of both methods of weight loss as well as the advantages and drawbacks of each method. It concludes by stating that laparoscopic Gastric B/ing is safe and efficacious for people with morbidly overweight over 60 years."
27498397,"The results of this study suggest that combined treatment with simvastatin and losartan is superior to single-drug therapy in improving lipid profiles. Conclusions In patients with Type 2 diabetes or hypercholestremic disease, pravastin does not affect their adipogenin levels; however, it does increase the expression of certain genes which may lead to an improvement in overall health. Furthermore, atorvastain reduces the risk of stroke in patients with severe rheumotoxicosis."
29713620,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the safety and efficacy of an extended-spectrum, long-term thiafolinol regimen for reducing blood triglyceride concentration in patients with acute myeloperolicysis."
27779429,"In this paper, we examine the effect of age on skeletal muscle function. We find that older subjects have less mitochondrial content than younger subjects and that this is due to an increase in physical activity."
25405560,"In this paper, we summarize the results of two large randomized controlled trials that have recently been performed on patients with Type 2 diabetes. The first trial, called the ""Dissurg2,"" is designed to evaluate the effects of laparoscopic Gastric Bypass on weight loss and improved quality of life in obese patients who have Type 2 disease. This study will provide important evidence for the use of gastric bypass as a means of regaining some of the benefits of medical therapy without compromising on patient's health."
29266851,"In this paper, Shallow systematically examines the relationship between body size perception and psychological distress in Greek adults. The results suggest that overweight and under-weight perception are associated with moderate to high psychological distress. Although there is some evidence that these perceptions may lead to weight gain later in life, it is not entirely clear whether they are related to physical or mental health consequences."
30219968,"In this paper, the authors describe the advantages and drawbacks of using a robot to guide the surgical intervention in patients with a knee injury. They conclude that the technology has several advantages over conventional methods: 1) it can be used effectively in pre-opportunity planning 2) it is easier to perform than manual rasping 3) it reduces the risk of complications in early stage 4) it improves leg length and quality 5) it does not cause a significant increase in pain during the first five years after the surgery. Finally, they conclude that there will be no long-term need for further studies on the efficacy of these new devices."
32242268,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights uses a novel knee-kneeling technique to investigate the effects of a new type of prostheses on knee resemblance to those worn by patients with atrophic knees. The results suggest that the new prosthese may be more comfortable and less painful than other knee-poisoning devices."
26272286,"In this paper, Conlusions and Roussoon present the results of a prospective observational study in which they assess the association between frailtiness and post-operative complications in older patients. They conclude that ""frilty"" is an important predictor of both major and minor morbidity for elderly patients who are at high risk of complications after surgery. These conclusions suggest that physicians should use a more sophisticated approach to predicting future adverse outcomes than simply using age alone."
22460295,"Conclusions The first randomized, controlled trial shows that a comprehensive development-based treatment for children with an atypically severe form of autism can be highly effective. Children with moderate to severe ASD make significant gains in imitation and spontaneous play acts after eight months of treatment. In contrast, children with more severe forms of the disorder receive little or no additional treatment."
28619779,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft demonstrates the efficacy of a three-year lifestyle change program in reducing blood pressure, fasting and Hba1c in patients with elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. This intervention was especially effective for patients who had very high risk of heart disease. The main effect was to promote  diet change and reducecholestrol concentrations. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups for total risk of death or for changes in body weight. Conclusions A program of intensified lifestylemodification undertaking in the primary care setting can favorably influence cardiovascularrisk factor profiles in high suspense patients."
24246907,"This paper presents the results of a prospective, cross-sectional study of physicians using the DeBrunner'skyphometer as a stand-in-place instrument for determining the severity of their patients' predicament. The results suggest that the use of this device may be cost-effective and non-invasive in evaluating the extent of their disease."
28876372,"This paper focuses on the role of exercise in children and adult congenital chest disease. It uses a novel approach to track changes in patients' exercise capacity over time. In this paper, Anderson discusses the relationship between heart-stricken children's exercise capacity and their pre-surgery characteristics. Anderson concludes by stating that ""submaximal cardioresponsibility"" is different in children than in adults. The differences are not exercise-modity dependent."
31952967,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a randomized, open-label, non-inferential clinical study comparing the efficacious and tolerable effects of Serenea rpens, Selenium, Serylium, Lycopene, and alfuzosolsin in men with low Ury Tract symptoms. We conclude that saw palmerto leads to a significant improvement in urine flow rates in men who have lower Ury tract symptoms than placebo. Conclusions This is an important conclusion because it suggests that both selenium and lycotene can be used as alternative treatments for patients with moderately active prostatic lesions. Prostaplex seems to have short-lived effects on improving symptoms but does not provide any additional benefits. The section contains papers published from Japan, Austria, the U.S., and joint studies from France, Denmark, Switzerll and Australia and the United States. A wide range of lower urinarry tract topics are covered. From BPH to Overactive Blading and Urodynamic Stress Incontinence These sections contain papers from Japan; Austria,the U.K.,and joint papers from French, Danish, Sw"
27149163,"The results of this study suggest that probiotics can be used as a preventive measure against obesity in low- income rural minority groups. Probiotics may also help to reduce blood glucose levels in patients with Cranioceriocerebrol injury. In addition, the use of probiotic milk might be an effective treatment for these patients."

23893306,"The results of this study suggest that a combination of statins and atorvastain may be able to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with high-risk pre-disease. In addition, it is reported that metformin can be used as an effective first-line therapy for patients with moderately hypercholestrolemia."
29765338,"Conclusions and Reneval The results suggest that Freudian therapy is the most efficacious treatment for adult anorexa patients because it does not significantly differ from Syft or leads to similar outcome at a low cost. Discussion These results demonstrate that An-EXR, compared with a credible compare intervention, was associated with bettercaloric intake over time in this group of patients. Further studies are necessary to determine whether or not these treatments can be used as long-term treatment for adults with anorexa. Both treatments lead to modest improvements in physical health and other eating disorder symptoms during hospitalization; however, there was no significant difference in remit rates between treatment groups at follow up. In addition, both treatments were well accepted by the severely ill patient. Family therapy seemed to be more effective than eating disorder focused therapy in terms of improving weight recovery. This study suggests that adding family therapy sessions may be more costeffective than outpatient treatment. All three treatment regimens were highly sufficient at one year's follow-up in termsof weight gain, return of malestruation, and aspects on social and sexual adjustment. Day patient treatment seems to be particularly effective in treating adult"
21491405,"Neck pain is a major source of pain in the workplace and no preventive strategies have been found to reduce neck pain. Myo-feedback training and ergonomics counseling are especially beneficial for secondary prevention, particularly among workers with moderately symptom severity and symptoms-related disability. Workers who participate in the job placement program show higher levels of readiness and emotional stability in coping after their work injury. A combination of physical activity and work-style intervention is more effective in preventing neck pain than an all-in-one treatment regimen. However, both groups do not report any significant differences in pain intensity or disability at follow up. In addition, there is no difference in quality of life between the two groups. This study will help inform policy in offices as well as providing the basis forprimary prevention of neck injuries in office workers."
25436902,"In this paper, the authors present evidence from a large number of randomised control trials that suggest early enteral feed is not associated with an increase in risk of neonatal convulsions or mortality. They conclude that early feeding for preterm and very low-birth weight infants can reduce the risk of enteringocolitis by as much as threefold. However, these results do not appear to be significant enough to prevent necrotizing infection in prematurely bred infants."
25365699,"This paper focuses on the use of evidence-based self-reporting measures to predict severity and severity of chronic fatigue in patients with the disease. It concludes that treatment incorporating evidence-founded physiological explanations is effective in relieving pain, improving quality of life, and improving physical function in people with the condition. In addition, it suggests that exercise therapy may be an effective intervention for patients with this condition."
25261329,"In this paper, Concluson focuses on the use of patient-derived endpoints as predictors of short-term efficacy of inhaled coticsteroid therapy in patients with moderate to severe asthma. He concludes by stating that these results may be used as a basis for future studies of chronic pain treatment."
29396832,"In this study, the safety and efficacy of a combination of statins with ezetimbe were investigated in patients with mild to moderate hypercholestrolemia. The results showed that ezetibe provided significant reductions in both LDL-c and TG as well as improvements in other key lipoprotein parameters. These results suggest that ezetimibe might be a promising new treatment for patients with primary hypocholestererolemia."""
27890056,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of two recent randomized controlled trials that have been published in the medical literature. The first is a frank review of the efficacy of nasal carriers for decontaminating surgical wounds and the second is an attempt to draw conclusions from a pooled pool of observational evidence. We conclude that there are no significant differences between the use of povidone Iodine and chlorhexinidine in preventing ostreptitious wounds after open chest surgery."
32174622,"In this paper, we describe the results of a three-year observational study on the performance of different cements for crowns. The cements used in this study were: resin composite, panavia f, and glass iconomer. Weibull was used to predict the survival of an individual crown bonded to one of these cements."
32268422,"After weight loss, there is a significant reduction in the levels of adponectin. This is important because it leads to a rapid increase in fasting blood concentrations. However, this does not lead to an improvement in insulin sensitivity or in other markers of disease. Furthermore, these results suggest that laparoscopic gastric bypass may be advantageous for patients with morbidly high body mass."
21735306,"In this paper, Conclusions discusses the use of the Neck Pain Question and the Nucleus Brain Imaging Question as outcome measures in neck pain patients. They conclude that the naivete and the score do not provide adequate predictors of change for neck pain."
30940994,"Conclusions The results of this study are summarized and compared with those of previous studies. After all periods, ES showed higher color alteration than the other two materials, and hypochloritate was more stable after immersing in a recirculating chamber. All three material liners showed improved performance over the 12 month period, but they did not need to be remade."
24641632,"Conclusions The results of this study suggest that a brief psychological intervention can improve the satisfaction of patients who are experiencing moderate to severe Erectile Dysis. In addition, psychoeplusmed participants report improved communication about sexuality with their partners. A brief group psychotherapy was found to be highly efficacious in improving treatment satisfaction for patients with mild to moderate ED. This paper extends previous conclusions and provides evidence for the effectiveness of combined treatment approaches for treating men suffering from erectil dysfunction."
28065886,"Conclusions The results of this study suggest that a newer cryoblation technique may be more effective in treating patients with acute atrial fibrillation. Although the safety of both methods is still unconfirmed, conclusive evidence exists to support the use of such an advanced technology."
17204567,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the evidence for weight loss as an effective treatment for knee arthrosis. He concludes by stating that it is ""practical adjuvant"" in the treatment of older patients with knee Ostearthritis because it has been reported that both diet and exercise have a positive effect on health-related quality of life. Although these results are limited to physical health or mental outcomes, they do suggest that there may be some benefit from weight loss in terms of improving pain and function."
28251248,"Conclusions Women with a high-dose regimen are at greater risk of fatigue than those who receive lower doses of chemotherapy. The results suggest that exercise may be more effective for improving sleep in older adults, particularly those with rheumaloid arthritis."
23483932,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of two recent studies. The first is a prospective, observational study on blood pressure in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 hypertension. This study shows that nitridipine can be used as an effective preventative measure against stroke in older adults with type 1 and 2) primary endpoints lower than those of diuretics or beta blockers. Both groups have similar risk of fatal and nonfatal stroke. Conclusive conclusion: Nitripine is more effective than other anti-hypertensesive drugs in preventing major cardiovascular events."
25882585,"In this paper, the effects of etching on bond strength are examined in two-step and one-step systems. The first system uses a phosphatic acid to etch enamel, while the second uses an electric current to self-etch. Both systems exhibit excellent results in terms of both bonding strength and patient comfort."
18362249,"Conclusions In this paper, Anderson systematically reviews the evidence for the use of pulmonary vein ablation as a first-line treatment for patients with persistent atrial fist. He concludes that it is safe and efficacious to use such an approach in patients with severe AF. However, there are still some drawbacks: Ads do not seem to have any significant effect on survival; and long-term follow-up studies are necessary to confirm these effects."
30322097,"In this paper, Dr. Barlow focuses on the effects of maternal and child-bearing regimens on pregnancy outcomes. He concludes that women who are pregnant have higher levels of blood methylation than those who are not pregnant. Pregnant women should be given 800 IU of vitamin D daily in order to reach a safe level of 25 hydroxyvinculomin D. However, there is no strong evidence for a positive effect of maternal or childbirth regimens upon pregnancy outcome."
30858729,Preoperative exercise for patients with lung disease who have a high-resemblance to the prolumac study may improve their performance in the post-lung resection procedure. The results of this trial suggest that short-term physical therapy can be an effective strategy for improving function and quality of life after surgery.

21722355,"This paper focuses on the role of physical strength in predicting ADL decline in older Mexican American women and men. It uses a validated, easy-to-read test called the H and Grip Strength as a tool to identify older people at risk for disability. The results suggest that slow gait speeds, poor physical activity, weight loss, and intellectual impairment are important risk factors for frailtiness while raising concerns regarding self-report fatigue and muscle weakness"
22472341,"In this paper, the American College of Chest Physicians makes changes to its recommended treatment for patients who have a high risk of developing infective heart disease. The Committee concludes that prophylaxes should be used only when there is a significant increase in the risk of contracting endo Cardiotis. However, it is important to note that these changes are not intended as a result of increased lifetime risk or because of an increased risk of acquired endopacity. This paper also discusses the use of antibiotics for post-abortion wound infection. It does not show any significant differences between the two groups. There was no significant difference in other parameters such as  Pyexia and Duration of Post-Abortion Hospitalization. Conclusions These conclusions confirm previous studies about the negative predictability of negative skin test results to these material. Prophylactic Doxycycline fails to prevent pelvic infection during spontaneous abortal surgery. Acute vaginisis is known to cause serious complications after pregnancy. Urinary tract infection is especially common in young women. Preoperative administration of cefasolin with amoxacin reduces the risks of scarlet fever following elective la"
23128863,"The aims of this study are to determine the effect of weight reduction on pain and function in knee patients with moderate-to-severe knee OA, and to investigate the effects of stretching therapy. A combination of diet and exercise was found to have the most consistent positive effect on health survey results than the control group; however, findings were limited to measures of physically health or psychological outcome that relate to the physicalself. Massage therapy seemed to be efficiacious in treating knee oatharthritis, but further studies need to be performed to confirm its efficacy. Short-term home-based strength training could produce significant improvements in strength, pain, physical function, and quality of live in patients with mild to mid-aged knee odyssey. Home-based resistance training improved functional ability and reduced knee pain in people with severe knee ostioli. Pulsed short wave treatment was effective for pain relief by improving functional capacity and decreasing knee pain."
20824372,"This paper focuses on the use of the Post-Optractive Mortality and Morbidity Score, or P-postsum, in the evaluation of colon cancer patients in France. Although it was initially used as an instrument for prediction of mortality, it has been found to be overpredicted in many cases. Conclusive evidence suggests that the P-possum model is superior to the other three systems in accuratelypredicting mortality."
29561949,"In this paper, Conclusions focuses on the effects of different cleaning solutions on the bond between glass fiber posts and dentine. He concludes by comparing the strength of the two cements used for cementation: Naocl-containing solution and chelating solution. The use of either solution did not lead to improved bond strength; however, it did lead to an increase in the amount of dentin that was removed from the root canal before cementation. Finally, he concludes with a review of the literature on how best to remove debris after post space preparation."
26581769,"In this fourth study, the authors examine the efficacy of two different types of restorative materials in treating primary morals. The first is a resinmodified glass cement; the second is an amalgam cement. Both are successful in treating Class I and class II mlochal lesions. However, they have a higher survival rate when used with the art-impossible technique."
17329725,"Conclusions In this paper, the results of a large telemedicine trial are summarized. The Alere Net system reduces mortality and improves quality of life for patients with severe heart failure. Home-based blood pressure monitoring is also shown to be an effective treatment for patients who have advanced heart failure because it allows physicians to closely track their patients' blood pressure at home. There are no differences in patient health outcomes between the two groups. Telemedicine can improve self-management behavior and control of blood pressure. A telephone machine that nurses use to record blood pressure values could be used to improve asthma control. This new technology will enable physicians to communicate with patients over the phone without interrupting their care."
17943887,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the efficacy and safety of intratavesical therapy for interstitial disease. He concludes that it is an effective treatment with no side effects. However, patients who receive only six weekly treatments respond favorably and have a long follow-up period. Conclusions Intravesical tuberculosis appears to be a good strategy for treating these patients because it does not cause any pain or warmth at the bladder level. Although there are further studies needed to confirm this new approach, BCG remains unproven in the management of interstital disease."
30470205,"This paper focuses on the effects of resistance training on older patients during their hospital stay. It shows that resistance training can improve strength and function in older people, but it does not increase the risk of falls among at-risk older people."
29689282,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the role of the brain in predicting and predicting behavior in adulthood. He uses a task-based approach to track changes in patients' mental health after ATL. This paper discusses the different stages of the patient's development from pre-Atl to post-Adolescence. The first phase is focused on decision-making, while the second phase involves reward-reward decisions. Adolescents with high levels of anxiety show greater threat responses than those with low levels of emotion. These results suggest that early childhood may help to distinguish between aggressive and maladaptive forms of aggression."
29406017,"In this chapter, Dr. Rivers discusses the latest developments in the field of pharmacology for treating multiple scleroid disease. The main conclusion is that 200mg of Modafinil does not improve fatigue or improve memory in patients with Multiple Sclerosis. There are no significant differences between the two groups on either outcome. For example, Medantine improved fatigue but did not improve learning or memory. DAP was also associated with improved leg strength and could be used as an anti-cramping agent in MS. Memantine increased fatigue while improving memory. L-Amphetamine seemed to have a beneficial effect on memory in some patients, but only on those with a long time of the disease who had a greater severity of their disease. Amantadines were more effective than pemoline in improving memory in people with mild to moderately ill brains."
19160249,"Conclusions A combination of nurse case management and patient education may improve the control of Type 2 diabetes in urban African American patients. Conscious that this approach has not yet reached statistical significance, it should be further considered as a strategy to reduce excess risk of complications among African Americans with Type 2"

20621942,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, observational study of patients with open palm and closed fists. We conclude that there is no significant difference in the recurrance rate between these two groups when compared to those who had only open palms. These results confirm the tension hypothesis proposed by the narrator for the disease."
17566796,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of ""revel's criteria"" as a test to select patients for initial spinal block therapy. He concludes that these tests are not suitable because they do not have sufficient specificity and negative predictive power to distinguish pain from other sources of pain. However, it is possible that some patients will respond to the first block. The results suggest that there may be a small number of patients who will respond with better pain relief than others. Conclusions A positive extension rotation test, the centralization phenomenon, and four pressure-controlled menometric exams effectively rule out painful ablation after screening ZJ block; one CPR produces a 5fold improvement in Posttest Probability of a Negative or Positive response to Zij block. Consciousness Three or more provocation tests are useful in determining whether back pain is caused by a facet joint. Brain Snack: This chapter discusses the concept of facet syndrome, which was initially thought to be an internal disease but now seems to be associated with both physical and mental disturbances."
19458020,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to evaluating the effects of a Mediterranean-style diet on blood triglycerides and other risk factors. They examine the effect of adding walnuts to a low-cholestrol diet in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Their results suggest that consumption of walnuts may be an effective strategy for reducing both total and LDL cholesterol."
28496349,"In this paper, the authors present evidence for the beneficial effects of a low-strength, low-carboxylicated form of calcin on blood marrow function in patients with Type 2 diabetes. They conclude by stating that there is no association between high-serum cocc/ucc concentrations and increased risk of Type 2 disease."

24957911,"After ten years, the cemented-moduled knee prostheses are associated with excellent results in the follow-up studies. The survival rate for this type of prosthesis depends on the material and design evolution, improvements in the surgical technique, and restrictions on indications. A case series study is conducted to evaluate the efficacy of four different types of knee replacements: 1) fixed bearing; 2) tension-guidled; and 3) open bearing. In this paper, we examine the performance of the two different designs when used on both sides of the knee. We find no differences in function or range of motion between the ""mobile bearing"" and ""fixed bearing"" versions of the Protection knee after two years."
19581635,"In this chapter, the authors discuss the latest developments in ablation technology. For example, a new technique called Cartomerge allows for shorter fluoroscopies and reduced time with OI at higher power. These results are important because they suggest that warfarin may be more effective in treating patients with persistent or permanent ailment. They also describe the use of electrodes to guide the catheter into the atrium as an alternative to conventional drug therapy. Although these methods have some drawbacks, they prove to be highly efficacious when used alone."
28678974,"In this paper, we describe the results of a three-year follow-up study on cast gold crowns and cores. The results suggest that these materials do not perform well when used as replacements for fixed bridges. Conclusions furthermore show that tooth types with adjacent teeth are associated with higher failure rates among endodonticly treated teeth restored using glass fiber reinforced posts. Posts can be used as an aid to replace single crowns in severely damaged teeth."
25802737,"In this paper, Anderson identifies eight factors that can be used to predict the outcome of treatment for patients with low-risk back pain. These include: 1) centralization; 2) physical therapy; 3) early recovery; and 4) psychological changes. Anderson concludes that these factors are important in predicting long-term outcomes because they help to identify sub-classes of patients who have low back pain but do not yet respond to conservative treatment. He then uses a mathematical model to predict how long it will take for an individual patient to recover from his or her condition."
24314354,"Conclusions A patient-centered, web-based approach to lipid management improves the quality of care for patients with type 2 and other heart disease. Although this approach has some drawbacks, it is highly regarded in the literature as an effective method of reducing blood pressure and lowering cholestrol levels. This study does not show any significant improvement in either control or risk factors over a one-year follow-up period."
30013206,"In this study, Wuthering Heights et al concludes that consumption of reveratrol can be used as an anti-inflammatory agent in Type 2 and Type 2 diabetics. The results suggest that reversal of the statin regimen may reduce the risk of heart attack in patients with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, it has been shown that consuming reseratrol for at least six weeks does not lead to any significant changes in blood mHg or body weight. However, there is some evidence that these compounds are safe and efficacious in treating Type 2 disease."
31368773,"A b-w-e-f-c-a-tutorial describes the efficacy and drawbacks of different forms of treatment for adults with mild to moderate symptoms of ADHD. The most important finding in this paper is that there are no significant differences in blood pressure or heart rate between patients receiving placebo and those receiving stimulant or nonstimulating drugs. In addition, these results do not predict long-term changes in adult academic performance."
27650684,"The results of this study suggest that dosed-density treatment is superior to conventional treatment in terms of overall survival. In addition, it has a favorable safety profile and can be used as an alternative first-line regimen for patients with early-stage ovarian disease. Conclusions A combination of high-dose dosing and rapid-restraining therapy may be more appropriate for women with late-stage or metastatic disease."
31711532,"In this paper, we describe the results of a meta-analysis of 100 systematic reviews that have been published between 1995 and 2005. The time frame for these studies is from 2 years to 5 years. We focus on finding out how quickly they meet explicitly defined thresholds for change in evidence needed to warrant updates. These signals include changes in scientific significance or relative increase in effect magnitude at least 50 percent. Major changes also include differences in characterization of efficacy that are less extreme than either of the two levels of importance described previously. Acupincture seems to be an effective treatment for children with colic but there are still questions about its safety."
27806951,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of balance training as an intervention to improve ankle function in subjects with acute ankle instability. He concludes that it is beneficial for patients with Cai to receive both resistance and protocol-based exercises while simultaneously improving their functional outcomes. The results suggest that balance training can be used as a preventative measure against ankle recurrent injuries. However, Anderson does not report any significant changes in ankle function between the two groups after six weeks of exercise therapy. This suggests that there may be some potential for further research into using balance training to treat individuals with cai."
28238400,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft systematically compares the efficacy of three different restorative materials in terms of their staining ability. The most promising material, Ormodycer, shows good performance over an eight-year period; however, it fails to meet the ADA's accepted standards for restoration."
22824531,This paper focuses on the efficacy of group education for improving self-management in Type 2 diabetes. It shows that patients with type 2 who are not well educated can improve their quality of life by learning how to manage their disease and maintain a healthy weight.
29872464,"Conclusions These conclusions suggest that these intervention yielded different effects with n reporting favorable improvement in si and di and n+sta reportingmarked reductions in healthfolk and inflammation. Consumption of refined grains, particularly whole grain foods, is associated with reduced risk of Type 2 disease in men who may be meditated by cereal fiber; however, some improvements are not seen among African Americans. Consistently frequent consumption of soft drinks or fruit drinks is also associated with increased risk of developing Type 2 diseases in Chinese women. In addition, excessive consumption of sugarsweetened soft beverages is associated to an increased riskof type 2 diabetes as well as the risk of hypertension. The American Diabetes Association's recommended allowance of moderate amounts of sugar does not seem to have any deleterious effect on primary preventive measures for Type 2 patients."
29034800,"The aims of this paper are to describe the effect of different exercises on pain, function, and strength in patients with pedicle fist pain syndrome. In particular, the results suggest that exercise is more effective when it is combined with other treatment approaches such as hip stretching and quadriceprastry exercises. A comparison between the Hippo and Knee rehabilitation regimens shows that they result in improvements in pain and function over six weeks. Although both intervention strategies result in improved pain and improvement in function for persons with paternal foot pain, there is no major difference in the diagnoses and prognoses of knee injuries between athlete and non-athletes. Both treatments aim to improve function and reduce pain but do not lead to significant changes in pain or function."
15762255,"In this paper, we describe the results of a series of hip replacements performed over a period of eighteen years. The overall survival rate of these total hip prostheses was poor, with only a slight improvement in the success rate from the previous two designs. Steerforth stems were more successful than those of other types because they had an improved cement-mantle geometry. However, the failure rate for these new design stems was much higher than that of the previous three designs. This is due to the fact that the surface of the coated stems does not adhere to the bone at all. These results suggest that there may be some kind of defect in the type of material used to coat the stems. For example, it is difficult to position the stem correctly on a cement cup without using a metal backing. Furthermore, the lack of stability of the cemented stems leads us to abort the use of Zirconia Heads since they are less stable and provide better midterm stability. At nine years, however, no change in the shape of the stem has been seen. A collarless stem did not have any effect on the fixation or recovery of the conventional single-piece total hip "
24292820,"In this paper, Conclusions demonstrates that the daily dose of 200 g of vitamin D is sufficient to rapidly raise 25-hydroxycalcerol levels in patients with severe acute myelitis. This results in a reduction in the risk of fractures and falls among patients with high-25-OHD levels. A higher dosage of 500 iu/d reduces the risk but does not lead to significant changes in blood concentrations."
21821300,"Conclusions This paper presents the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study of patients with rectal cancer. It shows that there is no significant difference in late-normal tissue damage between treatment groups. However, it does show that ""tumor oxygenation"" as determined by this standard procedure seems to be an independent prognotic factor for survival in advanced disease of the utmost risk. In contrast, when comparison is limited to highrisk patients, there is a significant benefit from rebuffing surgery but not with regard to survival. The aim of this study is to develop a consensus on the best course of treatment for rectal malignancies."

18617867,"In this chapter, Anderson focuses on the effects of physical activity on women's health during their menopause period. He concludes that physical activity may be an effective strategy to help women with menopaausal symptoms because it reduces the risk of developing congenital heart disease in women who have not been given enough time to get used to the idea of exercise. However, Anderson does note that there are still concerns about the use of conventional medicine for women with pre-menstrual symptoms. This chapter also discusses some of the more recent developments in the field of alternative medicine, including the growing popularity of hypnosis and restorative therapy."
23682371,"In this study, we report the first results of a prospective, i.e. single-blind, cross-sectional study of infants who have been breastfed for at least two years. We conclude that early consumption of Lactobacilus GG reduces the risk of developing atopic skin disease in children with a family history of asthma. This is due to the fact that they are more likely to be exposed to food sensitizers than to other pathogens. A probiotic mixture consisting of L. acidphilus DDS1,B. Lactis Uabla- 12 and F.oligoscharide was found to significantly reduce the frequency of ear opportune bouts of wheezeing by infants with cow's milk allergic intolerance when compared to control controls."
17679673,"In this paper, the authors present a novel risk-stratification scheme for patients with acute fistiosis who are at high risk of stroke and suggest that warfarin or aspirin may be more effective in preventing these events. They conclude by stating that although women are at greater risk for stroke than men, it is necessary to use antithromboctic therapy in such patients because of their female sex."
21501439,"This paper focuses on the use of iron in pregnant women to prevent anemia. It uses a mixed-pregnant and child-bearing population as controls. In this study, we find no significant differences between the effects of daily or weekly iron regimens on maternal health. Iron is not particularly effective in treating anemia in patients with low blood levels. Furthermore, it does not improve folate status during pregnancy. The greatest number of pregnant women are in group 1, but not significantly different from those in other groups. Conclusions These results suggest that there is a need for improved iron delivery systems in Nigeria."

28224415,"Back pain is a major cause of work absence in the U.S., and this paper discusses the benefits of early sick leave for workers with back pain. The study concludes that early sick leaves are more cost-effective than regular sick leave as it reduces the number of missed days due to back injury by up to 32 percent. Workers who were on sick leave at the beginning of the study were less likely to be absent from work during the first year after their injury. In addition, there was no significant difference between the severity of the injury and the time it took to recover. This suggests that an early intervention may be more cost effective than usual care for patients with back injuries."
21396097,"In this paper, Watts focuses on the time to new evidence from 100 systematic reviews that have been published between 1995 and 2005. The results of these studies indicate that there is rapidly new evidence that changes in efficacy or harm are commonly occurring within two years. Although many organizations recommend that updates be done every two years, few empirical evidence supports this recommendation. To determine how quickly such evidence becomes out of date, we use a method similar to that used by other authors for determining whether ""Quantitative signals"" or ""Questiative signals."" These signals consist of either a significant change in significance or relative increase in effect magnitude at least fifty %. For example, a trial with a large sample size may not provide sufficient evidence to support an appropriate treatment choice. However, because of the small sample size, it is possible to pool all of the original studies into one meta-analysis. This approach allows us to identify qualitative signals as well as quantitative signals."
23478873,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the effect of iron on children with malaria. He concludes that there is an increased risk of severe malarial disease for children with Iron-deficic anaemia due to fever in the part of the Gambia where malaria is most common. The evidence from this study suggests that daily iron can be used as a preventative measure against malaria and that it does not increase the burden of malnutrition or anemia in young children living elsewhere in Africa. However, we do note that some studies have suggested that iron may improve brain health in poor countries. Children with more severe Anemia are better able to develop motor and language skills when they receive iron; however, these results are not significant."
30023433,"In this paper, Dr. Rivers uses a case-control study to examine the effects of single-viewing of a short educational clip on players' knowledge of injury and injury prevention. He concludes by stating that ""this study showed some improvement in knowledge and behavior after a one-watching of an educational clip"" but that these findings need confirmation with larger samples to confirm what has been done. The results suggest that there is a reduced risk of injury from playing in leagues where body checking is allowed at age 13 compared with bantam leagues which are not allowed at all. This suggests that helmets may reduce the risk of head injury as well as other injuries. However, it is clear that helmet technology does not provide sufficient protection against head or neck injuries."
31203554,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, sfew-weekly observational study on bifdobacteria longum in combination with lifestyle intervention. When compared to conventional treatment, it is found that both groups have significant reductions in TNF, CRP, and other markers of hepatosis. This suggests that probiotics can be used as an additional therapy for patients with nafld. Furthermore, these effects may lead to improved glycemia, blood glucose, and lipid metabolism. Probiotics are also more effective in improving bowel health in patients with non-alcoholic fat liver disease."
21735411,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft eloquently describes the results of a large, well-cognized study in which he shows that daily doses of both calcitonine and vitamin D can induce favorable changes in arms, spine, and body Bmd in elderly women. He concludes by concluding that it is safe and efficacious to increase 25 OHD levels and reduce lower limb Muscle strength with regular physical exercise. Conclusive evidence does not support the use of either cholecaliferol or calcium as preventative measures against fractures in older women. The most successful strategy for preventing falls was to send out patients who had fallen from their homes directly to the nearest medical center. However, these patients did not receive a significant improvement in their mental health scores when they were treated with 800 iu of vitamin D per day. Furthermore, there was no difference in the risk of falling between men and women with different risk factors. Finally, we conclude that an adequate amount of dairy products can be used as a preventative measure against CVD."
28432856,"Conclusions This is a first-in-man study to evaluate the efficacy of supervised exercise for patients with sle. It shows that exercise training improves quality of life, fatigue, and depression in patients with this disease. In addition, it suggests that there may be value in using unsupervised exercise as a treatment for these patients."
20709126,"The triad is a family of chemicals that governs both physical and mental health. In this paper, we examine the relationship between these chemicals and the risk of injury in young women. We conclude that there are three main risk factors for injury: 1) Menstrual dysfunction; 2) Self-reported injuries; and 3) Use of pathogen weight control methods. A higher proportion of young females experience ""shab"" than those who do not experience it. These results suggest that education should be given to all physically active ladies and young women"
30356415,"Selenium Substitution Has a Significant Impact on Inflammation in Thyroid-Specific Autoimmune Disease. Antioxidants administered alone improved some clinical signs, symptoms, and / when associated with an antithyroid drug induced a faster control of patient's disease. This paper also discusses the use selenium to treat Graves' disease, which is characterized by increased risk of relapse."
26628678,"In this paper, the effects of bbs on central blood pressure are summarized. Although both treatments decrease central and pulse apologies, they do not seem to have any significant effect on arterial stiffness. Aortic wave reflectance is an important risk factor for patients with isolated hypertension. Both drugs reduce central stolic/pulsolic BP but only one drug does. The other two drugs also have similar effects in reducing carotidian systelic pressure. These differences may lead to different clinical outcome between the two treatment groups. For example, changes in brachial orifice pressure could be a key predictor of different patient outcomes. However, it is not clear whether these changes will translate into different patient-specific outcomes."
20238349,"The results of the Equality Loss and Implications of Nurse-Led Preventive Care for Coronary Heart Disease are presented in this chapter. Although there is some evidence that a gender bias affects participation in research, it is not clear whether such bias has an effect on primary care or on patients who attend nurse-led preventive care. In general, nurses' practice improves health and reduces hospital admissions within the first year of their visits to patients with chest pain. After one year of follow up, the heart rehabilitation program was combined with cardiological andprimary care services for lower-risk postMI patients. There was no significant improvement in patient quality of life after 1 year; however, short term effects were found. This study suggests that ""nurse-led prevention"" may be more successful than other approaches because it does not involve long-term changes in lifestyle and behavior."
15674407,"In this study, the authors conclude that exercise is associated with a reduced risk of stroke in men. However, physical activity does not seem to have any significant effect on strokes in patients with moderate-risk acute coronary disease. Although some risk factors relate to age and other characteristics, black race may be unexplainably risky. The use of anticoagulant agents alone or together with low-dosing aspirin doesn't seem to be superior for the prevention of major cardiovascular events in those with mildly elevated blood pressure. Conclusions There are differences between effect on renal functions among NSAids; these can be corroborated by specific changes in suppressing the Cyonoxogenase systems cascade. Consistently, no reduction in the odds of suffering an important stroke occurs in the combined Aspirin/Petitrol group. This conclusion supports the earlier observation that combination therapy may prevent atheromotic hypertension. Furthermore, it seems likely that prothrombotic agents such as warfarin should be considered more appropriate than conventional antiplatelet regimens."
30721699,"In this chapter, we discuss the efficacy of alpha lipoic acid as an anti-inflammatory and anti-dialysis agent. We conclude that it can be used as a preventive measure against CVD in type 1 and 2 patients."
31531322,"The aims of this study are to determine the safety and efficacy of low-dose meperidine as an analgese for preventing shiverring in patients receiving caes arean section. In addition, it is found that adding midazsolam leads to less hypotension, nausea, and vomiting during the first two hours of anesthesia. This paper concludes by concluding that ""low-dose vasopramide"" can be used as an adjuvant to shorten the time of anesthesia and increase the duration of an epidural block."
22381255,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of physical activity on weight gain among older post-adolescent women. He concludes that weight loss seems to be less harmful to those who remain physically active or who become active. However, as they age, menand women gain less weight than they do when they are physically active. This is due to the fact that their levels of vigorous activity increase their body's restraining potential. The results suggest that exercise may be useful for reducing weight in older people."
30948833,"In patients with low risk of major cardiovascular events after caBG, routine early treatment of antidiaminine-converting enzyme inhibitors does not seem to improve outcome up to three years after the initial treatment. However, it is important that this therapy be individualized over time and that each patient be given different doses of the drug. Conclusive evidence suggests that reduction of atheroscy is likely to be responsible for the benefits of antagonizing blood pressure in patients with stable heart disease."
22932280,"In this paper, we describe a double blinded randomized trial of the effect of iron on symptoms of iron therapy in female patients. The results suggest that iron stores are greater after iron treatment than after placebo; however, healthy individuals do not suffer from anemia or reduced absorption of iron from food. Iron fortifications reduce the frequency of iron deficient anemia in women during the six-mo regimen. This intervention can be used to improve endurance capacity after moderate exercise in previously un trained women. Consuming iron-rich fish sauce reduces the number of iron impairment anemias in women who have overtly low iron stores. Fortifying fish sauce is effective in reducing the severity of Anemia in men and women with high iron stores but does not prevent anemia from occurring. Iron status is associated with improved fatiginess and muscle fatigue. A reduction in blood ferritin levels was observed in the control group while no significant changes were seen in the anti-anemia group. Women with higher iron stores consumed more iron than those with lower iron stores did not show any improvement in their iron status. They also showed no change in salivary flow when they received iron as a daily dose."
27883924,"The results of this study suggest that low egcg may have an anti-obsity effect on body composition in men. However, it is not clear whether this effect is due to the use of green tea as a fat oxidant or because of its other effects on blood pressure, lipid profile, and inflammation. More studies need to be performed to confirm these results. Green tea does not lead to significant changes in body weight in patients with pre-colonal oessipation. In contrast, green tea extract seems to have a beneficial effect on post-throat lipolysis."
24304826,"This paper focuses on the effects of combined nurse-led self-care and group-based intervention on patients with Type 2 diabetes in Latino American communities. It concludes that these two approaches can lead to significant reductions in the risk of developing type 2 disease among African Americans, particularly those who smoke. Furthermore, it suggests that this approach may be more cost effective than other forms of public health intervention."
25039609,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a prospective observational study on patients with mild to moderate hypertension. We conclude that time of treatment is more important in controlling blood pressure than changing the combination of drugs. The reduction in blood pressure by bedtime has been shown to be more effective in reducing the risk of heart attack than by morning. However, there are some drawbacks: the convalescent trial did not show sufficient efficacy of either regimen; amlopril was better at reducing blood pressure over the 24 hour period and showed greater falls at night than OBP while given twice daily at bed-time. Bedtime therapy with phosphorus-lowering medication improves blood pressure control but reduces the frequency of nondipping and significantly reduces death, stroke, and major endpoints in older patients with severe hypertension who do not have a high ejection Fraction or heart failure"
30421960,"In this paper, Dr. Manette demonstrates that reveratrol can be used as an anti-diabetic agent in patients with Type 2D. He concludes that it is safe and efficacious for the treatment of both type 2 and Type 1D."
26848580,"Conclusions In this study, the authors conclude that a single large-dose of vitamin D does not improve either blood pressure or lipid levels in patients with IFG or Type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, they suggest that there may be a role for both high-dose and low-dose vitamin D in preventing type 2 disease. They also note that people with elevated blood pressure are at greater risk of developing Type 2 disease than those with normal blood pressure."
31611148,"Over a three-month study period, a paleolithic weight loss diet improved blood sugar control and several risk factors in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that this diet may be more effective than the conventional high-fat diet for managing Type 2 Diabetes. Although both diets achieve substantial weight loss, they do not lead to significant changes in other risk factors."
22935297,"In this paper, Bargh and Burrows discuss the efficacy of a family-based, newsletter intervention to increase FV consumption among undergraduate students. Their results suggest that ""cognition"" and ""ecstasy"" are more important than ""environment"" or ""self-report habits"" in predicting behavior. They conclude that these two factors play a key role in increasing FV Consumption."
28438641,"This paper concludes that there is no evidence of a benefit in the use of fluoxetine as a preventative treatment for patients who have undergone weight loss. However, it does suggest that taking a ripiprasole-containing diet may be an effective strategy for treating anorexic nervoses."

32161895,"This paper focuses on the use of negative-apical irrigation to reduce postoperative pain in patients who have asymptomatic pulpitis. The results suggest that positive pressure irrigation can be more effective than needle irrigation in reducing pain. In addition, the endovac irrigation system is more effective because it uses less irrigant solution and has a shorter reach."
28003299,"Predicated on elevated blood sugar levels, prediabetes is a disease that can be prevented or delayed by weight loss, healthier eating, and physical activity. This intervention reduces the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by reducing body weight, improving fasting insulin, and reducing glycemic excursions within one year of enrolling in this program. However, lifestyle intervention does not prevent Type 2 from developing. In addition, it does not increase the risk for heart disease among patients with Igt."
18805125,"This paper presents a novel approach to predicting the risk of coronary disease in middle-aged patients with no known history of heart disease. It uses a combination of categorical factors, such as blood pressure, total cholesterol, and smoking, to predict the relative risk of chest disease among different age groups. The results are highly convergent for both high and low risk groups."
28978949,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to improving Type 2 diabetes care in African Americans by using telemedicine and remote patient observation. The results of the study suggest that ""telehome monitoring"" is an effective method for controlling type 2 disease in primary care settings. A nurse led telephone-based intervention improves blood glucose levels over six months but does not lead to significant improvements in other end-points or quality of life. However, there are indications that it may have a beneficial effect on heart disease and patients with Type 2 disease. This paper concludes that ""Project Dulce,"" a health coaching program designed to improve self-report medication adherence as well as CVD riskfactor control among African American patients, can be used as an alternative to traditional methods of care."

22573122,"This paper focuses on the protective effects of regular physical activity on heart disease. It shows that men who are physically active have a lower risk of dying from all causes than those who are not physically active. In addition, it suggests that physical activity may be more effective in reducing the risk of death from both ischemic and non-heart disease."
16418645,"This paper focuses on the use of evidence-based approaches to improve health in school environments. It concludes that there are shortcomings in all areas examined, and that there is an urgent needs for health promotion in the school setting. In particular, it suggests that intercultural differences in perception and reporting back pain could lead to different levels of prevalence of the disorder among the different countries. The results suggest that harm reduction goals should be used in school drug teaching. Conclusions That low back pain is common in Australia but that most of this problem is caused by poor self-perceiving of health. Some personal risk factors explain up to 12 percent of first time lowback pain. School-based back care education may reduce the frequency of back pain reported by children."
24207135,"Conclusions We conclude that surgery is not a good treatment for patients with high risk of disease. In contrast, we find that it is difficult to justify surgery for men with low risk because they are more likely to have multiple positive cores and other serious complications. Consistently, the results of our study show that long-term bcc can be safely cut from 36 to 180 months without any compromise in quality of life. Astrazeneca's grant supports further studies on whether or not PSA testing improves prognosis. The most recent edition of the Eau Guidelines on Prostate Cancer summarizes the latest developments in the field."
18395982,"In this paper, the authors present a meta-review of the literature on acute back pain. They conclude that there is no additional benefit in using active strategies to treat patients with lower back pain; rather, they suggest that patient outcomes may be improved by educating doctors about the importance of physical therapy. The results show that patients' belief in spontaneous recovery is positively correlated with their previous experience with lowback pain. Furthermore, evidence suggests that self-care approaches can be used to improve health care delivery."
30541375,"Telemonitoring is associated with improved health outcomes among patients with a past history of admission to the emergency department in a small country. The results are encouraging, add further support for implementation of this intervention as part of co-primary care. In particular, there seems to be some benefit in general health status and improvement in depression scores. A large-scale controlled trial has been conducted to evaluate the effect of remote patient observation on health outcome in patients with severe obstruthive pulmonary diseases. This paper concludes by describing the main drawbacks of the study: it was not possible to conduct a full randomised control trial because of the difficulty of conducting such a large number of trials at once. However, we do find that the addition of a weekly telemedicine session does not significantly reduce hospitalizations or improve readmissions in patients who develop adriatic disease. Furthermore, both groups showed significant improvements in their self-management skills during the follow-up period."
25012720,"The Royal Norwegian Navy is a good example of how physical activity can be used to improve health. A pedometer with step goals and instant feedback can be very effective in improving physical activity levels among overweight and obese elderly patients with knee ostesis. This suggests that walking at least three times a week may be sufficient to reduce the symptoms of this condition. In addition, it has been found that walking more than 3000 steps per day can lead to better results in terms of pain and function. These results are important because they suggest that people with knee or hip OA should follow an exercise regimen that also emphasizes decreasing pain and body-massage. However, these studies need to be large enough to confirm their efficacy."
15977010,"Conclusions This paper provides further evidence for the use of health status and disease severity measures in clinical trials. It demonstrates that both measures are highly sensitive to changes in drug-induced efficacy, suggesting that they may be useful as predictors of long-term outcome in rheimatic diseases."
32191359,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft argues that there are differences between the approaches to public health in the ways trials are used and how results are reported. For example, some studies have shown that early education improves mental health while others have found no significant effects on physical health. Conclusions That early education reduces risky behavior by improving educational attainment, health insurance cover, income, and family environment. This study also provides evidence of neighborhood poverty as a preventative measure against all causes of death. It also shows that prenatal and infant care services can be effective in reducing all cause mortality among women and children living in low-society households."
31810222,"Chlorhexidine prevents the degradation of bonding strength of self-etch and etch-adhesion systems by inhibiting the breakdown of collagen. This effect is due to the presence of a surfactant in the solution, which interferes with the bonding ability of the two different types of adhesives."
24175602,"In this paper, we present the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study in which patients with moderate-to-severe knee arthrosis were randomized to either an 8-week program or a 6-month program. Both groups showed significant improvements in health and function over the course of the first two months. The primary outcome was improvement in pain and function for both groups; however, there was no difference in selfefficacy among the different types of instruction. This suggests that patient education can be used as a preventative measure against future disease epidemics."
31796090,"In this paper, we present the results of a large-scale observational study on patients with colorectina who underwent gastric surgery. We conclude that sarcox is an independent risk predictor for major post-operative complications and that it is important to use this information to stratify patients at higher risk of complications. Furthermore, our nomogram uses only three variables: age, tumor stage, and systemici inflammation as predictors. These results suggest that there may be some value in using these three variables to predict long-term morbidity from pre-surgery."
19366379,"The results of this study suggest that sertraline treatment may be more effective in treating patients with moderate-to-severe OCD than fluoxetine. Conclusions This preliminary finding suggests that augmentation by rispirdone in doses up to twom daily might be efficacious in adolescents with treated OCD. Although there are some limitations in the study design, these results suggest that augmenting with rescipitram in dosages as much as 2m daily could be efficient in patients with treatment resistance. Consciety These preliminary findings indicate that augmenter with riperidone is no more effective at improving OCD patients' symptoms during open label period. In addition, higher occupancy of sertridone seems to be associate with better response after one year of steroid treatment of patients With OCD: Both drugs were found to be well tolerated; however, they had different side effects. Fluvoxamine was particularly effective in preventing dropsout from relapse and inducing remission. Clomipramine was also equally effective but showed different sideeffects."
27966571,"This paper focuses on the association between basal scores and survival in patients with type 2 or mild-to-senile Type 2 disease. It also discusses the use of calcitonin as a predictor of survival in this population. The results suggest that it is important to maintain a healthy body mass for women who have undergone a period of rapid calcification. In this study, we find no evidence of an association between 25-OHD levels and BMI among older adults. However, we do find some evidence of a positive relationship between bone dentility and aponectin."
25277808,"In this paper, we present the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study on the effects of daily doses of 5,000 iu.d. of vitamin D on bone health in adults and children. We conclude that there is little evidence for the efficacy of long-term daily use of 3,000 IU as a preventive measure of blood levels of 25-hydroxyd."
12804478,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a prospective, i.e. random, single-blind study of patients with generalized anxious disorder. We conclude that it is concluded that there is no practical value in using antidepressant drugs for treating anxiety in outpatients without depressed mood. Conclusions Venlafaxin XR has been shown to be an effective and highly tolerated agent for the short term treatment of mild-to-meditated patients with Generalized Affective Disorder. It was found that buspirone was superior to placebo on the ""had anxiety subscale."" This finding confirms the long-lived remission of GAD after only one year of treatment."
23818412,"This paper describes a six-week exercise program that improves physical health and mental health of patients with fiboia. In particular, it suggests that swimming can be an effective treatment for the disease because it reduces body temperature and increases blood flow. Ai Chi is particularly effective in improving symptoms of musculosity while stretching only improves psychological well being. The addition of water therapy to the usual treatment regimen for women with fm has some drawbacks: the distance from the patient's home and the number of patients who can be accommodated per session are significant determinants of whether or not to invest in this type of treatment. Conclusions Short-term exercises and educational programs could produce immediate benefits for those with  Fibomyalgya. However, studies have shown that short-term exercise does not lead to long-lasting effects. Pool-based exercise appears to be more effective than balneous therapy; however, statistical analysis fails to show any significant superiority between pool-based activity and Balneothérapie without exercise."
31228362,This paper focuses on the effects of physical exercise on executive function in older adults. It concludes by stating that it is important to note that only small changes in fitness are associated with significant changes in brain function. More research needs to be done to understand how different exercises affect neuropsychological function and how they affect the P1b-erp component.
21029469,"The results of this study suggest that a lifestyle-intervention program can be used as a preventative measure against type 2 disease in primary care. In addition, it reduces the risk of future Type 2 disease by reducing body weight and improving physical activity. This evidence supports the use of lifestyle changes as an effective treatment for high-risk adults."
25919402,"This paper discusses the benefits of acoustic rehabilitation for first-time hearing aid wearers and their patients. It also discusses barriers to the widespread use of home-rehabilitation services. The results of this study suggest that there may be short-term differences in treatment effects between first time and experienced hearing assistors, but it does not seem to be important for long-term improvement. For example, patients with greater initial hearing loss receive significant improvements on quality of life when they receive prefitting or postfitting training. Hearing aids are still used as an aid for improving speech recognition. However, many people do not use them regularly because they have socially unadjusted hearing loss."
20642296,"This paper focuses on the protective effects of aprobiotics on both atopic and food-allergic patients. It concludes that probiotics can be used to treat both acute and chronic aeds, particularly in children with congenital malnourished ads."
27460044,"In this paper, we summarize the results of three large randomized controlled trials. The first is a meta-study on the effect of daily doses of 1,25-OHD1 on muscle strength and falls in older adults. The second is an observational study on elderly people who have low levels of 25-hydroxycalcerol. We conclude that there is no evidence for improving muscle strength or function in older persons with low 25-OH D levels. However, further studies are needed to determine how best to increase these levels. Six weeks of high intensity resistance training was safe and efficacious in increasing strength, muscle quality, and Musculoskeletal Morology in older individuals. Ca increases bone mineral content but does not affect fracture incidence. There is no association between blood pressure and other health outcomes except for breast and prostate cancer. A decrease of 2 mm Hg in sickly subjects with Ca suggests that more studies need to be done."
25430608,"In this paper, we present the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study. We conclude that the dietary approach to stop hypertension, the Dash, is safe and can be used as an alternative treatment for people with high blood pressure. It has been reported that it can reduce blood pressure by reducing body weight, improving sensitivity to insulin, and improving lipid profiles. This suggests that the Dash diet may be more effective than other dietary approaches for preventing heart disease."
30165599,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to reducing blood pressure and improving lipids in patients with type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. They use a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a monounstained fat diet as a preventative measure against hypertension. Their results suggest that an adequate amount of fat can be found in a healthy diet but that it does not lead to significant changes in blood pressure. Furthermore, they conclude that a Mediterranean style diet is superior to a low carbohydrate diet due to its high content of unsaturated fat."
18683044,"Fulvestrant is a novel, highly potent anticancer that can be used as a stand-alone or in--you guessed it--another drug. In this paper, the authors describe a ""hybrid trial-design"" approach to evaluating the safety and efficacy of two different forms of chemoprotective agents --fulvestrant and Tamoxifen --in patients with breastcancer who have not responded to either agent before. The results suggest that fulnessorrant may be an effective first-line treatment for postpausal females with advanced breastcarrying."
29275399,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of a large-scale, single-centre study of patients who have been successfully treated with transcathetic aortific valve implantation. We conclude that there are excellent mid-term safety and performance outcomes in newly-invited low-volume centers. For example, Noaf is associated with an increased rate of stroke but no higher mortality at 30 days or at one year after follow-up; however, the registry for women with severe Aortic Stenosis has demonstrated good mid- term safety and efficacy. The Lotus Valve was shown to demonstrate excellent hemodynamics and improved functional class status as well as superior long-term outcome. This single center experience suggests that it is a highly desirable treatment option for ""high-risk"" surgical patients with similar survival. After two years, the Notions trial shows that TAVR can be safely used in intermediate risk patients without significant risk of death or complications."
15480707,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to treating children with acute and perforatedappendicitiis. They use ab-oned absorption culture to predict the severity of the disease and then compare the efficacy of different antimicrobials against each other in terms of length of hospitalization and post-anaecdote. The results suggest that an early start of treatment is necessary for attenuating the rate of complications after appendicectomy in children. For example, patients on the GAC protocol have a shorter duration of follow-up than those on the Generalized Appropriate Care regimen. However, there are no significant differences in infection complications between the two groups. A single broad-specrum antibiotic can be used as a curative therapy for acutely ill or persistently relapsing patients. This study suggests that ceftozidime may be more effective than Netilmicin when it comes to long-term prophylaxed care for children with severe convalescent period."
17054183,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the effect of breast feeding on asthma in infants with a history of asthma. He concludes that an exclusive breast feeding regimen is associated with reduced risk of asthma during the first four months after birth and suggests that public health intervention should be extended to prevent childhood asthma from developing. Soy-based soy formula has been shown to be more effective than cow's milk in preventing allergic disease in susceptible infants. However, there are still concerns about the safety of such a new type of food for infants because of its potential for cross-contamination."
28771519,"The present study concludes that improved blood glucosemia can be achieved through a combination of probiotics and low-glyciac index diets in pregnant women. It does not reduce the risk of maternal fetal malapropism, but it does improve gestational gain and maternal glyceric control. A low-Glycemic Index diet is more effective in preventing pregnancy weight gain than a high-GI diet. Women with GDM consume the Dash diet for four weeks and have beneficial effects on their lipid profiles, glucose tolerance, and postpranolence. There is a trend towards later gestationsal age at beginning of insulin therapy; however, both regimens achieve better control of patients with lower doses of insulin."
31906372,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective, i.e., open-label, random-access, single-blind, febbering study of patients with metabolic syndrome. We conclude that a high-carbohydrate diet combined with probiotics can help to reduce body mass and improve blood lipids in patients with type 2 diabetes."
22510792,"Conclusions In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the effects of a higher-protein diet on weight loss and bone health. We conclude that a lower-fat, high-protein meal can lead to improved blood pressure, reduced lipid levels, and improved cardiovascular risk. Conscious of these results, we recommend a low-carbody diet."
11406040,"Conclusions In this paper, we present the results of an eight-week study comparing the efficacy and safety of two different drugs in pregnancy. Both are shown to be effective at controlling blood pressure but do not lead to any adverse effects on maternal or fetal health. Although there is no difference in blood pressure after 10 weeks, both groups seem to have reduced their risk of sudden delivery. The use of alpha-ketanserin seems to increase Ige antibody formation; it also increases the risk for ""atopic disease"" in children."
26844102,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to preventing and reducing the risk of Type 2 Diabetes in women with pre-gymnia. They focus on lifestyle changes that start during pregnancy and continue postpartum as well as evidence of their efficacy in preventing or delaying Type 2Dids. Their main concerns are that they will not be able to obtain adequate numbers of subjects for their study and that there will be no significant change in physical activity or weight after three months."
30086061,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of a randomized trial comparing fast track care to conventional care in patients who underwent colonic open surgery. This study concludes that fast track treatment is safe and can lead to faster recovery than conventional care. We also discuss the use of ERAS as a post-opportunity strategy for improving patient outcome after colorecttal surgery. It was found that eras had a beneficial effect on both short-term and long-term outcomes. Furthermore, it showed that older patients adhered more closely to an eras program when compared to younger patients. These conclusions are further supported by the American Society for Surgical Metamorphism and Nutrition's ""Evidence Based Consensual Review of Post-Operative Care for Colic."""
28298219,"This paper concludes that physical activity is not associated with improved birth outcomes in women who are overweight or obese during their pregnancy. However, it does suggest that physicians should discourage excessive sitting and time-consuming activities for pregnant women because they may increase the risk of premature birth and death."
23597181,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of a series of randomized controlled trial studies on the efficacy of enzalutamode in treating patients with castration-responsive prostate cancer. The most important finding is that men with low levels of free and bioavailable testosterone have a greater risk of mortality than those with higher levels. Men with high free and available testosterone levels are at increased risk of death within nine years of hormone measurements. Adiprex has been used as a first-line treatment for prostitutes with metastatic disease because it reduces the risk of complications associated with these conditions. However, other anticancer drugs such as morphine or tyrosine have not been shown to be effective in treating older men with elevated blood levels. This paper discusses some of the latest advances in the use of transdermal testosterone as an adjuvant to conventional therapy. It also discusses the potential role of rogen treatments in improving bone mineral denition in older men who have low pretreatment concentrations of testosterone. Although no significant changes in body mass were observed after 12 weeks of treatment, there was little improvement in physical function from either treatment. There was only one reported adverse event"
31384474,"This paper concludes that a wearable activity tracker is not as effective as it could be for improving physical activity in patients who do not attend regular exercise regimens. However, this paper suggests that future studies should focus on larger sample sizes and longer study times to better determine whether wearable devices can be used to promote physical activity."
29561067,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effects of nicotinic and adjunctive treatment on patients with first episode disease. They conclude that narcotics do not seem to be effective in treating early-onset psychosis; however, they have some promising applications for these agents. For example, taurine appears to improve neurocognition and brain GSH activity in early-stage patients who are at risk for relapse. A further study is needed to determine whether or not E-EPA can be used as an antipsychotic during the early course of illness."
24287215,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates the efficacy of a home-based exercise program for patients who have been treated for hip arthrosis. Although there are differences in outcome measures between the two groups, Anderson's results suggest that these patients can benefit from a more individualized treatment plan."
22852063,"In this paper, the effects of maternal zinc status on pregnancy outcome are summarized. Women with low blood zinc concentrations have a greater risk of pregnant failure than women with high-quality diets. This suggests that maternal zinc needs to be increased in order to maintain adequate levels of zinc during pregnancy."
25843244,"The results of this study indicate that both an employer-directed low-cost education program and a small monetary incentive similar to usual care reduced the risk of LDL-cholester reduction in college students. Discussion Findings support short-termefficacy of ""CM"" for reducing tobacco among college students; future research should explore further improvements to CM, including longer intervention periods and the recruiting of motivated quitters. Conclusions In this paper, cigarette smoke appears to be associated with several malignant conditions of previously unknown association with tobaccouse. Walking attendance does not lead to higher energy expenditure, however, and weight loss is also not improved over an eight-month intervention. Post-hoc analysis suggests that the amount of exercise required for successful long term weight loss was much higher than those usually recommended in behavior treatment programs. This concludes that greater adherence can reduce the risks of cardiovascular and mortality whereas greater adherence to the western pattern may increasethe risk among initial healthy women. Consequentially, financial incentives produce significant weight loss during an eight month intervention; however, subjects regaind weight after intervention."
24529799,"Conclusions The results of this study suggest that the use of sof-lex discs and aelite enamels as polishing systems can be used to improve the surface appearance of many different types of composites. However, these new materials are not suitable for restorative applications because they do not have sufficient surface roughness or discoloration to resist staining."
19555517,"In this study, Wu et al. concludes that garlic has small short-term benefits on lipidemia in Type 2 diabetic subjects. Garlic reduces total cholesterol and low-dental lipoprotein content but does not have any effect on the risk of cardiovascular disease. This is because garlic has been used to treat a number of different diseases, including rheumatoid heart disease. However, Wu suggests that garlic might be useful for some patients with moderately high cholesterol levels who are at higher risk of future events. He also discusses the potential role of garlic in treating hypercholestererolemia."
23152283,"In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the performance of risk-adjusted risk algorithms in open heart surgery and in caBG only surgery. Our results suggest that short term pulmonary rehabilitation can be used to improve pulmonary function before and after operation and in preventing complications from developing. Preoperative imp therapy reduces the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications and length of stay in patients with high risk of developing a pledging thrombosis during surgery. This study concludes that ""preoperative Imp"" is safe and effective for reducing pcs and prolonging hospital stay."
29336593,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the effects of iron and vitaminA on infants with anemia. He concludes that it is likely that these two can be used as tools to improve child health in poor urban women before they are pregnant. The effect of both iron and A on blood concentration was not known. Conclusions That there may be some health benefits for a regimen that increases the nutrition status of iron, folate, and Vitamin A in poor-urban young women prior to they become pregnant has not yet been reported. However, we suggest that such a program might have significant health benefits because it reduces the burden of infection and prevents stunting caused by persistent diarrhea. This study shows that a single daily dose of iron leads to substantial increases in haemolin concentration among children in western Kenya. It also suggests that malaria, HIV infection, low social economic status, and short length of breast feeding are strong predictors of detrimental hematology in this population"
24717342,"In this paper, Wu et al. concludes that ""palmitic acid"" from palm oil might be a good alternative to trans-fatty acids from hydrogenated soy or partially hydrogenated vegetable oils in margarines because of their high fat content. They also suggest that the use of these fats is preferable over hydrogenation as it can modulate blood lipid levels and inflammation. The results suggest that coconut oil may be more favorable than other fats for improving lipoprotein profiles. Polyunsaturated fats are healthier; they increase the capacity of cell to promote efflux ofcholester from culture. A monounscanated fat diet produces better lipophosphoryl concentrations than does a polynsaturated one. Consuming such a diet increases the ratio of free cholesterol to total LDL but reduces the risk of heart disease. This suggests that replacing palm oil with an unhydrogenized vegetable oil will reduce the risks of MI."
29168154,"In this paper, the authors present a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of probiotic Lactobacili in preventing or reducing the severity of acute hysteria. They conclude that probiotics can be used as an effective and cost-effective treatment for patients who have a hard time swallowing pills."
29793496,"The results of this study suggest that a dietary intervention, combined with physical exercise and a high-potassium diet, could be effective in reducing the risk of type II diabetes in patients with polycytic ovaries."
30544168,"Conclusions In this study, we found that overweight and obese patients lost more weight after six months on either a lowcarbogeneous diet or a high-protein, high fat diet. This suggests that HSF consumption may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease by metabolic processes involved with apo CIII. However, these results suggest that a lower ""choose-high-beef-protein"" diet may be an alternative for weight loss in women with elevated risk of heart disease. We conclude that both diets lead to similar weight loss but that they do not result in improved body composition. Both groups also showed greater weight loss when compared to their conventional diets. Although there were some differences in blood pressure among the two groups, no significant difference was seen at one year's time."
31613390,"A randomized double blinded trial comparing metformin with fluoxetine in the treatment of overweight subjects was conducted. The results suggest that the combination may be more beneficial than placebo in weight loss. In addition, there is no significant difference between the primary outcome of the study and the subsequent publication. Conclusions There was no significant relationship between reviewers on most item in the checklist; the use of this tool may aid to improve the consistency and repeatability of GRAD assessment, particularly when used by two randomised trials independently."
32152453,"Prosero concludes that the benefits of delayed bp-lowering treatment for mildly elevated blood pressure are limited in the high risk group. In addition, prognosis is favorable for patients with moderately elevated levels of blood pressure. The results of this trial will contribute to further understanding of the beneficial effects of delayed drug treatment on primary prevention ofCVD in patients who have mildly raised blood pressure but lack other comorbidities."
21272751,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, i.e. single-blind study in which we compared the effects of two different drugs on patients with varying degrees of hypertension. We conclude that both drugs are effective at reducing blood pressure in elderly subjects and that they can be used as stand-in-waiting devices to track changes in blood pressure over time. This is important because it will allow us to predict whether or not new antihubertensive treatments will be more effective than current approaches."
26908700,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, randomized, and open-label study of the safety and efficacy of two different probiotic regimens for the treatment of preterm premature infants: Bifeidobacium Lactis at 6  2. 109 C.F./day reduced the incidence density of nosocomyal infections in vaginal-labyed infants but did not increase the frequency of death or necessitating hospital stay. We conclude that probiotics can be used as a preventive measure against late-onset disease in preterm babies."
24323914,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of consumption of soy extracts on women's health. He concludes that it is not possible to use soy as an alternative therapy for treating menopaausal symptoms because of the small size of the population and the large number of women in the study. This paper also discusses the results of two large randomized breast cancer trials, one in which ""the benefits of Hormone therapy outwere its risks for almost all women,"" and another in which only ""the risks associated with Hormonious treatment outweigh their benefits."" Although these studies have been published widely, they do not provide much information about how women are changing over time."
20091582,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of a three-month intervention study in which patients with back pain were randomized to either exercise or spinal manipulation. The results seemed to be good for both groups; however, they did not show any significant differences between the two groups. Both groups showed improvements in pain and functional status over the course of the study. A home-based exercise program was found to be more effective than a physical therapy regimen because it focused on individual muscular deficions rather than general exercises. This paper concludes that there is no need for further research into self-management methods for older adults who have chronic knee pain."
29462641,Preterm infants have a higher risk of developing delayed or decrepit mental health than their preterm peers.
30395694,"Conclusions This randomized-controlled trial provides promising evidence on the generalizable of joint attention, play, and language intervention for young children. The treatment does not affect language orglobal ratings of social function and communication. Further studies need to betterunderst and/or whether treatment effects might be improved by increased intensity and duration. In this study, parents were found to have significant improvements in their children's language, social interaction, and stress level. Ados findings must be understood cautiously since results do not match with clinical experience; further research needs to be undertaken. Parents perceived substantial changes in their child's languages, social interactions, and their self-stress level. Play is an inexpensive effective intervention that can serve as brief-term training upon communication and social engagement for children with Autistic Spectrum disorder."
21567221,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the use of gaming console exercise to improve heart failure patients' physical health. It uses a mixed-effects meta-regression approach to examine the effects of home-based and motivational-based approaches on patient adherence to exercise. In particular, it suggests that both approaches may be effective in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life for older patients with convalescent heart failure."
22760566,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effects of fortified foods on iron status and anemia in children aged 6 to 24 months. They conclude that both DFSs are effective at preventing iron from deficiating in school-aged children; however, they do not report any significant differences in iron stores or anemia among different age groups. Iron drops were recommended for infants with low birth weights who were exclusively breastfed for six mo. Fortified fish sauce was more effective than either FeSO4 or Ferrous Sulfate when added to wheat-based snacking. Both studies suggest that fortification can reduce the risk of lead poisoning in developing countries. However, neither group is able to prevent anemia because their blood concentrations are too low. The only positive effect of Ffortification was the reduction in packed cell volumes which occurred during the experimental group. Both food products studied are safe and facilitate similar good growth, but no significant difference in feeding-related differences was noted between the two treatment groups. All three options for Home Fortification of Complementary Foods are efficacious for improving iron status in such population: 1) ferrous spilfate, 2) electrolytic iron"
23372566,"Conclusions A culturally-tailored, evidence-based intervention for type 2 diabetes in Latinos was found to be efficacious. However, it did not lead to significant improvements in adherence to the recommended amount of physical activity or in changes in Hba1c levels over the first six months of follow-up. This suggests that ""literacy-sensitive"" approaches may be more effective than ""community-based approaches."""
24445948,"The results of this study suggest that short-term steroid replacement therapy for older men with mild to moderate BPH may lead to improvements in body composition, muscle strength, and cardiac endurance. In addition, the use of F with TT appears to reduce the effect of T therapy by attenuating the impact of TT treatment on prostate size or PSA. Conclusions This study suggests that long-term Trenasteride/Testosterone regimens can be used to prevent bone loss, decrease body fat, and increase lean body Mass in elderly men who have low Bioavailable testosterone levels. However, there is no significant change in behavior, function, depression, or physical performance after 12 weeks of TRT. These preliminary studies suggest that in old men with lateonset hypogonalism, six months of TRL normalizes both serum androgen levels; however, it does not seem to have any effect on prostatic tissue or cell functions."
29159857,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, nested, and cross-examination study using a novel approach to assessing the effects of methylphini date on children with mild-to-mid-thirties disorder. We conclude that both drugs are effective in treating children with moderately severe or life-threatening ASD. Although there is some confounding evidence for their efficacy, these studies do not reveal any significant side effects."
30903209,"This paper focuses on the association between diet and bone health in women. Women who eat more than nine cups of coffee have an increased risk for hip fracture, but no association between consumption of meat or red meat increases this risk. In contrast, men with high dietary protein do not increase bone loss nor improve physical performance. A higher gram of soy-protein per day does not seem to have any beneficial effect on bone health; however, there is some evidence that it may be due to reduced absorption of calcium from animal sources."
30521577,"In this paper, Consolt outlines the pros and cons of various restorative approaches for children. The most promising is the use of the Hall technique to manage caries in primary teeth. This approach has been shown to be more effective than conventional methods for managing caries. Conclusions furthermore concludes that there is no need for improved reporting of patient outcome measures with prognostic evidence."
24476510,"This paper focuses on the efficacy of testosterone in older patients with mobility limitation. It is concluded that this treatment improves muscle strength, stair climbing power, and rapid gait among older men with limited walking ability. In addition, it provides evidence that resistance training can be used as an effective fall-prevention intervention. The LiFE program appears to have the potential to reduce the risk of falls for older adults with moderate to severe knee obstructive musculosity."
19160341,"This paper presents the results of a cross-sectional study comparing the effects of physical activity and diet on children and adults. The results suggest that intervention families consume less food, eat less salt, and walk further than control families. For children, changes in physical activity appear to be associated with changes in both VO2max and LDL ratio1 and 2 years after the intervention. Thus, this study supports the efficacy of exercise and school-based intervention in preventing and reducing the risk of death from physical inactivity."
24726015,"In this paper, Dr. Manette focuses on the effects of adding cannabbinol to patients suffering from chronic pain. He concludes that it may be useful for relieving pain in patients who are not completely relieved by their strong opioid regimens. Shorter sleep duration is associated with more persistent psychological distress than does shorter sleep. The first study suggests that ""the spread of one habit in social networks affects the spread of others."" A long-term placebo-controlled study is needed to determine whether cannanoids might have a longer-term effect on pain. This study meets its primary objective: to demonstrate the inferiority of ce over placebo in treatment of muscle spasticity in MS. Although there was no new safety concerns, these results suggest that HIV- positive individuals who smoke pot may require higher doses than recommended by the Food and Drug Administration. Conclusions There were few side effects; only mild to moderate adverse events. Narrator also discusses the use of Nabilone as an adjuvant for patients with musculoskeletal pain."
29560832,"This paper discusses the relationship between coffee and hip fracture. Women who drink more than nine cups of coffee have a higher risk of fracture in men, while there is no association between drinking more than six or seven cups per day. In contrast, women who consume less than three-quarters of their daily caloric needs have an even greater risk of developing a fracture. Consuming dairy products has also been shown to improve bone mineralization in young girls. Young females are particularly attracted to dairy products because they appear to be especially rich in calcium."
26927924,"This paper focuses on the use of the Simple Score to predict risk of falls, disability, and death in older adults. It uses the Polish version of the Good-Frilty Score as a framework for predicting future adverse health events in older people. In this paper, Conclusions develops a new approach to predicting long-term mortality by using the Short-Frail Score as an outcome measure."
29026933,"This paper focuses on the use of the Turkish version of the Foot and Ankle Scope as an outcome measure for patients with foot and ankle pain. It concludes by stating that it is possible to use this instrument in combination with the Physician's Pain Questioner, the Prometheus Achilles Tension-Fool Score, and the FFi-5pt as patient-report measures."
17636648,"In this paper, we describe the results of a double-blind, quackery-controlled study comparing the effects of daily doses of ascorbic acid to placebo in preventing and treating the common cold. We conclude that these studies do not lead to improved health or longer duration of cold symptoms for healthy adults when compared to a daily dose of 1,500 ng. However, the efficacy of these studies does not match that of other studies; furthermore, there is no clear advantage in taking more than 1,000 ng from the diet."
28676426,"In this paper, we establish a range of changes in question-naire scores to be used as an aid in interpreting change in health status measures. The results show that there is a small but significant difference between the mean values of the moderately important difference and the mean value of the major difference. These differences are useful for understanding how well patients respond to treatment and for predicting whether or not new trials will be successful."
32230939,"Conclusions A worksite intervention is shown to improve many of the risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, but few of the improvements can be attributed to the use of ""worksite health assessment"" and personal health reports. The results are not as favorable for African Americans with Type 2 diabetes as they were for American workers with elevated blood pressure."
25933128,"This paper discusses the efficacy of three different approaches to weight loss: self-control, external control, and a combination of behavior-remedy and lifestyle changes. The results suggest that all three approaches are effective in promoting weight loss; however, they do not produce significant changes in psychological well-being after 30 months. Although this does not support the theory that obese patients need to be encouraged to lower their weight loss goals, it suggests that these approaches can be used as low-cost strategies for disease prevention."
19360230,"The effects of green tea on body weight are not as strong as those of other dietary approaches. In addition, the consumption of this natural substance does not lead to any significant changes in body composition. However, it does lead to an increase in LDL glycemic load. This is due to the fact that green tea has anti-oxalating and thermogenic properties. Furthermore, Green tea extracts may be useful in preventing or reducing atherogenic loss of lean body mass."
25317988,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a large, well-respected stroke study. We conclude that treatment with hypotensives in patients with high blood pressure confers significant reductions in both mortality and morbidity. The primary endpoint for all strokes is reduced by the use of diuretics, beta blockers, or other agents. Although these agents are more effective than their conventional counterparts, they do not reduce the risk of major events. Instead, they seem to have little effect on reducing blood pressure."
19588353,"Conclusions In this study, we conclude that reducing blood pressure to a target of 170 mmHhg is safe and can be used as an effective treatment for patients with Type 2 or mild-to-moderate hypertension. We conclude that the combination of statins and ACE-conjugated drugs may be more effective in preventing major cardiovascular events in older adults."
26207053,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effect of self-monitoring and self-effacing intervention on patients with Type 1 diabetes. He concludes that it is possible to improve both patient's health and well-being by teaching them how to recognize and respond to their symptoms. This can be used as a preventative measure against hypoglyciaemia in long-tongued type 1 disease. Anderson also discusses the use of BGat as an anti-hypoglyciemia treatment. It reduces both internal and external control of blood glucose but does not increase the risk of serious hypogycemia. Anderson suggests that a self-management program might be useful for improving awareness of hypocrisy in people with Type1D."
23482592,"Conclusions In transitional countries, sexual health declines while general and general morbidities increase. Men in these countries report higher mortality than those in the rest of Europe. Concliusions This is due to a combination of increased age-related morbidity and poorer quality of sexual function. Although there is no direct evidence for this association, confounding studies suggest that bariatic surgery may be an effective treatment for severe obesity."
14583958,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effects of smoking on patients with acute myosmoky heart disease. They conclude that it is important to stop smoking in order to reduce the risk of death from aneurysm and to improve long-term outcome for patients who have had a myomyotic heart attack. Their main conclusion is that smoking should be discouraged in all patients because there are still some concerns about the safety of this practice."
26356689,"This paper discusses the use of pre-operative morphine loading to prevent weight loss in patients with hip fractures. In this study, a randomized trial is performed to compare the safety of minor liver resect without drainage. The results show that there is no significant difference in the major morbidities between the two groups. However, it does suggest that rectal surgery without draining is associated with greater risk of infection and anasthotic leakage. Post-operative nutrition declines for two months; however, age is significantly associated with higher risks for cardiogenic pneumonia, myomycardial infarction, ventricular archiasms, bacteremia, and in hospital mortality. A multimodal recovery program is recommended for patients undergoing open or laparoscopic reconstructive surgery."
28827256,This paper focuses on the effects of family-based and community-based approaches on improving self-management in patients with Type 2 diabetes. It concludes that these approaches may lead to improved health outcomes for those with poorly controlled Type 2 disease.
30666617,"Probiotics are becoming a hot topic in the scientific community because they can help to improve many different health conditions, including: rheumatism, gout, and even Type 2 Diabetes. In particular, probiotics have been shown to be effective at preventing or reducing these disease-causing effects."
26187342,"This paper focuses on the effects of two different dopamine-agonists, haloperidonel and L-Dopa, on the overconfidence in error after single dose administration in healthy subjects. The results show that there is no significant effect of either drug on draw to decision or prediction threshold to decision but only a small effect for high confidence incorrect responses. Further studies are needed to examine the efficacy of these two drugs in improving brain function."
30426004,"In this paper, the authors present the results of a large-scale, long-term, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of narcotics in patients with relapsed schizophrenia. They conclude that there are no significant differences between recurrance or symptoms during the maintenance period of the trial, but that changes in Eeg synchronization may lead to improved efficacy for NAC. Furthermore, these results suggest that NAC may have some beneficial effect on treating chronic schizophrenia."
22071801,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed description of the efficacy and safety of two different anti-thrombotic agents in patients with moderate to severe atheosis. The first is aspirin; the second is clopidgrel. Both are effective in improving walking distance but have little effect on bleeding time. They conclude that ticlopidine can be used as a stand-alone therapy for patients with mild to moderate atheotic disease."
23609774,"In this paper, the authors present evidence for the efficacy of long-term inodine use in pregnant women. They conclude that it is possible to prevent pregnancy-induced hypothyroidiism from causing adverse effects on fetal growth and development. However, they do not report any significant changes in mental function after two years of treatment."
27761306,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effects of probiotic treatment on the risk of opportunity for enteral colonization, sepisis, and delayed hospitalization. They conclude that early-infected infants should be given probiotics in order to reduce their risk of developing necrotizing Enterocolitis after birth. The results of this study suggest that early administration of bovine breve or Lactobacilus at a dose of 6 x 2.0  10 CFU/Kg/day does not reduce the rate of NEC; however, it does lead to reductions in late-onset Sepis and mortality. A larger trial is required to confirm these results in low-birth weight infants."

28854877,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a literature review on conditional cash transfers and their effects on maternal health in Mexico. We conclude that there is a strong relationship between the Oportunândes conditionsal cash transfer program and improved birth weight outcomes for women living in low- income countries. This suggests that the program may be able to improve maternal health by encouraging pregnant women to be more informed and active about their pregnancies. Furthermore, it is suggested that the use of vouchers can lead to improvements in maternal health service uptake."
24978932,"This paper focuses on the effects of strength training on balance and gait in older adults. It discusses the use of step perturbation exercises to improve balance and reduce falls in patients with traumatic childhood injuries. The results of these exercises are compared with those of other exercise regimens, and it is concluded that resistance training can be used to prevent falls in older people."
19808490,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to ECG assessment of patients with acute atrial fist-throbbing. They first use an algorithm to determine whether or not there is any RBBB in the patient's blood. The results suggest that general anesthesia may increase the risk of episophagial damage. This study suggests that warfarin can be used as a preventative measure against atrial fibrilation. Adjuvant therapy during the first six weeks after af ablation reduces the severity of atrial tyranny and need for heart rate control. Post-hoc analysis concludes that propranolalol does not have any effect on stroke. Furthermore, ICD therapy has no effect on death except for an increase in Non-Cardiac Mortality."
17488967,"Aspirin is an effective and cost-effective treatment for a wide range of diseases, including acute myosclerotic scarlet thrombosis. However, it does not increase the risk of stroke or death in patients with severe aortic scarlet disease. In contrast, aspirin can be used as a second-best preventive measure against these dangerous events."
31645057,"This paper describes the results of a large-scale, randomized, controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of preterm infant feeding with an exclusively mother's milk diet. It concludes that this treatment may be more cost effective than other methods for reducing morbidity and mortality in prematurely ill infants. In addition, it suggests that pasteurization can be used to prevent colonization by using breast milk as a source of nutrition."
29633142,"In this paper, we present the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study of 17 patients who had asymptomatic knee pain. We conclude that the Pros-static short forms performed well and that they may be useful in future studies for evaluating whether pain-related changes are associated with improved patient outcome. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Venetian Applicator's Short Pain Questioner is more accurate than the other measures used to measure pain intensity in military patients. Finally, we discuss the use of the Medtronic Functional Immobility Questioner as a stand-alone measure for measuring pain severity and function."
28391233,"This paper focuses on the use of the Ipa-Question Score to assess physical activity in older adults and concludes that it can be used as a tool to track changes in health over time. It shows that sitting time is associated with both short-term and long-term mortality, but that this does not mean that people should stop sitting for extended hours."
22851269,"In this paper, we present the results of a large-scale study on elderly patients with bladdercancer who received gemcitabine as a first-line treatment for their disease. We found that older patients were more likely to receive active treatment and live alone than they were in younger age. Furthermore, our results suggest that malnutrition and functional status are important risk factors for early death in older patients with acute myeloid disease. A second study is performed on older patients treated with chemotherapy. It finds that there is little difference in the severity of the disease when compared to those treated by physicians. The main aim of this study is to determine whether or not older patients can be expected to benefit from longer-term treatment."
16061898,This paper discusses the merits and drawbacks of using the tto test and conjoint measurements to predict health outcomes. It concludes by comparing the results of two experiments with that of the competitor technologies. Both experiments find that laparoscopiccholecrystectomy is generally superior to the competitor technology in terms of cost and quality of life.
20459782,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effect of resistance training on leg power and muscle strength in older women. He concludes that resistance training is more effective than physical activity for improving functional performance in older adults because it can be used as a preventative measure against falls and fractures. However, his results suggest that exercise may not be as effective as other forms of exercise. This paper also suggests that low levels of exercise are safe and more feasible for older adults to adhere to long-term regimens of physical activity. The authors conclude that walking has been shown to be associated with reduced risk of dementation among older Mexican Americans. They conclude that ""improvements in qualityof life and general function that occurred as result of participation in an exercise program in elderly people"" could lead to improvements in health and well-being."
19433422,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of head injury on posturography and suggests that there may be delays in recovery for some patients. He uses ImPACT as a tool to track changes in postural control over three to four days after an injury. The results suggest that players who have had previous injuries are at greater risk of having future ones than those who do not have any history. This study also suggests that both severity of symptoms and duration of symptoms can be used as predictors of whether or not they will need to return to play"
22117033,"In this chapter, Conclusions and co-workers discuss the latest developments in the field of ablation for patients with a history of recurrent atrial fever. These include newer approaches to ablation, such as PVI isolation and lumbar puncture, which have been shown to be more successful in treating patients with persistent ailment. Conscious of the fact that long term follow-up is not possible, conclusive evidence suggests that it may be best to wait until after several years before starting any new treatment."
27591931,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of a large European patient cohort who were treated with sct for rpc. Although there is no concluding evidence that esstalitemide will improve BCR free survival, it does lead to significant reduction in overtreatment as a treatment option. We conclude that cryotherapy can be used as an aid to advance from phase 2 to phase 3 trials because of its ability to predict failure-to-progress. The final paper discusses the use of flutamine as an adjuvant to determine progression."
23499244,"This paper focuses on the use of electroconvulsions as an early treatment for patients with initial-onset schizophrenia. It shows that ECT is more effective than morphine in treating patients who have not yet recovered from their initial episode of disorder. In addition, it has a positive effect on patient's quality of life."
29168225,"In this chapter, we present the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study of patients with anxiety. We conclude that there is little evidence for the efficacy of passiflora in treating anxiety; however, we do suggest that it may be useful as an alternative to conventional antipsychotics."
31336032,"This paper discusses the effects of early-onset memory problems on autistic children. It focuses on two main concerns: 1) ASD involves a selective lack of time-based planning and 2) ASD's difficulty with working memory, which depends on visual information. In this paper, several possible explanations are presented for the association between delayed recall and delayed learning. Time-based task absorption is associated with functional outcome in daily life but not as a result of executive control. However, both groups have different levels of generalization when they are younger. The older children show greater delays in their retrieval of the standard than does the younger children. These results suggest that there may be a role for timing in ASD development."
25005924,This paper focuses on the use of discrete choice experiments to aid decision-makers in making informed decisions about treatment for patients with Type 1 and Type 2 syphilis. The results suggest that physicians may be better able to predict which treatments will work best for their patients when they are first introduced to new treatments.
24683002,"In this paper, the authors present a summary of the evidence supporting warfarin's superiority over aspirin for preventing major bleeding in patients with acute heart failure. They conclude by arguing that warfari is more effective at preventing stroke and systemcymbolic events in patients without compromising their safety. Concurrently, however, they argue that long-term antithrombotics should be given to patients with severe heart failure because there is no concluding evidence that these regimens are safe or effective."
19270759,"In this paper, we present the results of a cross-sectional analysis of twins from three families: adoptive parents with children with and without ADHD; biological parents with no children with or without symptoms of ADHD; and adult subjects who did not have symptoms of both types. We conclude that there is a strong association between the two subtypes of ADHD, as well as an association between TPH2 and other pathophysiological and molecular alleles. Our findings suggest that parental smoking during pregnancy may lead to lower brain function in children with more severe ADHD than does maternal drug use."
24206044,"This paper concludes that green tea can be used as a preventative measure against Type 2 diabetes. There are no significant differences between the two groups, but there are some significant within- group changes. More studies are needed to determine whether an EGCG-rich extract of green tea will provide any benefit in patients with Type 2 disease."
24772264,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights argues that the use of dentin bonds as sealants does not lead to improved caries prevention. He concludes by comparing the two methods: air-airbrasion and ""abrasion"" followed by ""acid etching."" The results suggest that these two methods are effective at preventing pit or fissure lesions in permanent teeth. However, it is necessary to perform further studies on the efficacy of these two different methods before making any final decisions."
25632374,"The results of this study suggest that increasing the daily caloric allowance of 1,200 iu/day is sufficient to achieve desirable levels of serum 25-OHD in most subjects. Furthermore, there are no significant differences in blood pressure or lipids between men and women who have adequate levels of vitamin D. This suggests that both high dairy calcium and increased serum Vitamin D are associated with greater weight loss. In addition, both diets produce significant weight loss; however, neither diet produces significant fat loss nor gains in body mass. However, milk does attenuate theorexigenic effects of body weight reduction. BMI also negatively associates with the increase in 25-H diabetic status. Finally, moderate exercise improves weight management for young adults."
16286432,"Conclusions In the first three years of treatment, a significant reduction in costs is seen. The risk of future work loss is predicted by age, gender, and severity of RA. Costs are relatively invisible to employers; however, workers tend to have specific sub-groups of patients who need more attention than others. After 105 weeks of therapy with influsimab and MTX, there is a substantial increase in the probability of working loss among service workers as well as those who receive pension payments from their employer. This study confirms our earlier findings that work characteristics strongly alter the likelihood of work loss for people with RA but does not predict work disability at all. It is important to note that both RA and other diseases can be associated with different degrees of work disability. For example, Lithuanian patients suffering from RA often stop working during their first year because of changes in leisure time activities. However, these patients do not show any signs of work disabling."
14583987,"In a cross-over design study, each infant was fed five d for 5 days. On day 4 and 9, the gastrointestinal Transit Time was estimated using Carmine Red. The Protein Hydrolysate Formula had a markly shorter bowel transit time than the Standard formula; this suggests that feeding neonates on cow's milk does not increase risk of asthma in the first few years. However, it is suggested that feeding neonates with high protein content did not increase any risk of allergic reactions. Furthermore, in the group with a parent history of cowmilk allergy, early exposure to cattle milk increased the risks of a broad range of allergic reaction, especially earhoeal. This conclusion is important for public health because it suggests that public health intervention may reduce the burden of childhood asthma and its related traits. Atopy or active cigarette smoke are major influences upon wheezeing at age 6 and adulthood. Children who were breastfed were more likely to have an asthma attack than children who were only breastfed. Although exclusive breastfeeding did not prevent these symptoms, there was a reduction in the frequency of recurrent cough during adulthood among babies who were both breastfed and exclusively breastfed"
26605535,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the effects of a laterally-wounded foot orthotic and a knee brace on pain and function. The results suggest that wearing a shoe with a wedge can reduce the amount of time it takes for the patient to get used to the new device, while still reducing the severity of the disease. In addition, this study suggests that using an insole or brace may be more cost effective than other treatment strategies."
26746590,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights focuses on the effects of low-doses of molybiquine on brain function. He concludes by stating that although there is some evidence for a possible association between high-dose use and depressive mood in humans, it is not clear whether such effects are permanent or temporary. The majority of ESH patients stop using these drugs spontaneously, but only 50 % continue to use them after DSM IV has been met. There are no serious adverse events, no neurocognitic effects, and no blood pressure increase. However, we do find that two different groups of people show similar mental health problems when compared to one another. Furthermore, our results suggest that altering brain activity during cognitive processing may be associated with prior Mdma use."
19821273,"In this study, we find no evidence of benefit from simvastapin in the treatment of patients with recurrent wounds. We also find that aspirin does not prevent recurring ulcer bleeding. Furthermore, our results suggest that warfari is superior to both anti-thrombotic agents alone; however, we do not yet know whether these two agents will be more effective in treating patients with severe acute coronary disease."
24088547,"The results of the present study suggest that public health intervention may be needed to help pregnant women achieve an adequate diet. In addition, it suggests that mild-idine depleted children are better able to perform well in school than their pregnant counterparts. This is supported by a prospective, febbily-blind, random-effects analysis of a population of Australia's poorest mothers and children. It was found that there was no increased risk of pregnancy loss or worsening postpartum thyroid disease in women with mild-Iodine Deficiency; however, this did not increase the frequency of goitorgenic stimuli during pregnancy."
19843330,"In this chapter, the narrator discusses the benefits and drawbacks of early antihysteria. He concludes by saying that it is important to avoid hypotension when there is no need for or contraindication from early treatment. The side effects of aspirin are described in detail. For example, one patient has a severe case of constipation after four days of therapy; another had a mild case of heartburn after seven days of treatment. Nicardipine seems to have similar beneficial effects on cerebral and myomyoctal ischemic events. A recent study compares an antagonizing agent with a Calcium antagonist in patients who have a high risk of acute stroke. Both agents reduce the severity of the attack but do not lead to significant reductions in the rate of death or major cardiovascular events. These results suggest that blood pressure should be lowered before a stroke occurs."
31611064,"In this paper, we present the results of a randomized, controlled trial on the efficacy of zinc-supplation in treating hepatosis. We conclude that it is safe and effective to use three-moles of zinc as a daily regimen for patients with alcoholic comorbidities. The results suggest that zinc can be used as an anti-virinizing agent in patients with severe hepatitic encephalopathies."
23913029,"This paper focuses on the association between overweight and poor motor function in young children, particularly those with limited at-risk childhood heights. The results suggest that changes in overweight status may be related to poor motor control ability among girls and boys but not for boys. In this study, we examine the effect of physical activity on weight loss during the first four years of school. We conclude that change in overweight behavior is associated with poorer motor skills and lower academic performance in boys and girls. However, there are also strong associations between obesity and other factors, such as balance ability, which may lead to better health intervention and prevention."
22405279,"This paper sums up the literature on stroke risk factors, warning signs, and treatment. It concludes that a well-educated community will be able to reduce the risk of a stroke and improve the speed of care for patients after their onset. In particular, it suggests that an evidence-based stroke education program may be useful in reducing the frequency of stroke and improving the speed at which hospital visits are delivered. The results suggest that this approach is likely to be more cost effective than surrogacy or direct intervention."
24700446,"In this paper, we describe the results of a single-arm hip resurroplasty in Lithuania. It is reported that the Arthopor two cup performs well for pelvic Ossification with respect to polyethylene wear. However, there are significant differences in the outcome between the cementless and cemented arthopor capsules. The patients' health-related life is similar to those of reference groups after total hip replacement. For example, patients with low back pain have less long-term functional improvement after surgery than those with greater pain. This study concludes that ""hysterical quality of life"" is similar for both groups except for function where patients have worse function. A large-scale open-cohort study is needed to confirm these results. There is no difference in the frequency of heterotophosis between cemented or noncemented prostheses in patients without Osteoarthrosis; however, it is necessary to determine which type of prosthesis best suits the patient's needs at mid-to-long term followup."
25899581,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the relationship between Type 1 and non-diabese control of blood glucose levels. They conclude that although the risk factors for Type 1 are still intact, greater Glycemia is not sufficient to predict future complications in patients with Type 1; depressive symptoms predict angina and/or insulin resistance. The results suggest that there may be some degree of retinopathy in Type 1 but that other risk factors such as body fat mass do not seem to play a significant role in these events."
30456865,"The results of this study suggest that consumption of white rice is not associated with a significant increase in risk of heart attack among Iranian men. Furthermore, the use of sour-tea treatment leads to a decrease in blood lipid concentrations but does not lead to improvement in other risk factors. In contrast, orange juice and pine bark extract are safe and do not seem to have any beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease."
31954418,"In this chapter, Anderson focuses on the effects of physical exercise on children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. He uses a case-control study to examine the effect of vigorous exercise on patients with ADHD. The results suggest that moderate exercise may be effective in improving executive function in children with both mild and severe symptoms. Anderson concludes by stating that there are few studies that show direct benefits from physical exercises for people with an ""adhoepitic"" condition."
18775062,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of physical activity counseling on patients with Type 2 and other chronic disease. He concludes that walking is an effective intervention for improving health in older adults with type 2 and suggests that it may be more cost effective than other forms of exercise. The results suggest that walking can be used as a preventative measure against elevated blood pressure and heart disease. However, Anderson does not report any significant differences between the two groups at either follow-up visit. This study emphasizes the importance of community participation in physical activity promotion."
27994451,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a pilot study in which we found that telephone-based physical activity coaching did not improve outcomes for patients with mild to moderate COPD. We conclude that health mentors improved self-manage capacity but notquality of life; compared to regularly phone contact, which ourselves had positive effects on where decline is usually expected. The addition of coaching seemed to be no good than selfmonitoring."" Further studies are needed to determine whether or not home-based exercise therapy can deliver similar benefits to center-based pulmonary rehabilitation."
17194261,"Conclusions In depressed patients, imipramine seems to be the most efficacious and tolerable of all. Both drugs are well-tolerated by all patients; however, there is a significant difference in the proportion of patients receiving remission after switching from fluoxetine or sertraline. The ""equipoise-stratified"" approach uses three different treatment strategies to determine whether each strategy is as effective as other. For example, one patient with major depression switchs from fluvoxine to venlafine over a period of two weeks while another patient does not respond at all. This results in a reduction in the frequency of side effects and an improvement in the quality of life for the remaining patients. Although more than half of these patients do not respond during this time period, it is possible that they may benefit from additional treatments such as lithium or hypnotics."
16539827,"Conclusions This paper provides further evidence that the efficacy of blood-based and drug-induced treatments for patients with rheusid arthritis is similar to that of placebo. It also supports the use of the Becky-Fox instrument as a stand-alone, validated measure of disease activity."
30019391,"In this study, the authors describe the results of a three-year observational period for crowns, veneers, and onlays. They conclude that color match is achieved at 36 months and that there are no predictors of failure of the treatment. The technique investigated shows advantages like less damage to healthy tissue and avoiding endodontic intervention. Time- dependent changes in plaque or gingival score between and between groups was statistically similar. Significance The self-applied resin cement performed very well over a two-year period when used by relatively experienced but supervised student. Conclusions At the three year recall appointment; the authors find that the Adhesively Liquid All-Ceramic Restoratives have repaired large defects, regardless of the Cavalin margin location. Cliniical Implications S Tooth colored all-ceranic CAD/came restorations provide good clinical performance over an eight-month period when put by relative inexperienced students."
21827522,"The results of this study suggest that all patients may be able to benefit from a brief form of psychological treatment, particularly those with a high level of pain. In particular, the effects of CB are not limited by patient baseline characteristics; they seem to be more effective in improving specific pain-related beliefs than any other treatment group. Furthermore, both groups show significant improvements in mood states and pain severity. A further study has been performed on patients with temporomandiodine-induced degenerative joint diseases. This study concludes that mid-laer therapy can be used as a preventative measure against these painful conditions."
23269815,"In this study, we investigate the effects of morphine-stimulation on bone mineral concentrations in healthy volunteers. The results suggest that mowing down folate is an effective strategy for preventing hyperhomoclasemia in older adults. We also find that consumption of breakfast cereal has a positive effect on blood levels of B12 and reduces the concentration of Hcy in elderly subjects. This suggests that folate deficiencies may be involved in hyperhocousysteineemia. Furthermore, studies have shown that multivitamine and mineral supplements are not as effective as they were previously thought to be. However, these studies do not show any significant changes in body mass or function."
26914664,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of regular activity breaks on blood sugar and body composition in healthy adults. He concludes by stating that it is more effective than constant physical activity to decrease postprano and iary glycaemia or insulinemia in normal-weighed adults. The results suggest that frequent activity breaks can be used as an objective measure of physical activity for both the measuring of ""sedentary"" and ""physical activity"" behavior in adulthood. Conclusions These conclusions suggest that the activePAL may be useful as a tool for assessing health status in overweight and undernourished women. Conscious of the potential for improved glucose control in overweight children, Anderson suggests that teachers and parents should work together to promote moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activities in children."
28752947,"This paper discusses the benefits of exercise for older adults, particularly for improving strength and endurance. It also discusses how resistance training can be used to increase muscle strength in older adults. In particular, it can help older adults with a higher adherence to an exercise regimen."
9755013,"Neck pain is a common cause of neck pain in western societies. There are few published studies on the efficacy of physical and psychological approaches to treating neck pain. A prospective, controlled study was undertaken to determine the relative efficcies of either physiotherapy or electroacupuncture for the treatment of mild degeneration of the neck. Both methods were found to be more effective than placebo in terms of improving symptoms. In addition, both groups experienced a significant improvement in their pain scores after controlling for other variables. The authors concluded that ""transcutaneous nerve stimulation"" was a very valuable pain reliever and gave rapid restoration of neck mobility in acute neck pain."" They also concluded that coaching was the most costeffective form of treatment."
19457497,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to treating patients with acute stroke by comparing the efficacy of an eight-week course of amphoxetamine and two-week treatment of physiotherapy. They conclude that both drugs improve recovery in patients with moderately severe motor deficits but that they do not provide any additional benefit for functional or motor recovery in these patients. However, their results suggest that there may be a role for drug use in improving outcome after stroke."
22786497,"In this paper, Bech and Reisby present a meta-analysis of 370 random drug trials. The results suggest that memantine is more effective in treating alcohol dependence with major depression than escilopram. They conclude that the two are useful adjuncts to treatment for alcohol dependence comorbid with Major Depressive disorder. A comparison of Memantine's efficacy as an antidote to eScitalopram suggests that it may be possible to use genetic markers to predict whether or not patients will respond to these drugs."
27306431,"Conclusions A school-based physical activity intervention increased daily spontaneous physical activity behavior in boys and girls. In contrast, black girls showed no change in their physical activity. This suggests that strength training may be an effective strategy for preventing youth from becoming overweight. Conscious of the fact that black girls tend to be less sensitive to physical activity than white girls, this study concludes that exercise is associated with lower fat mass in young girls. However, it does not support the notion that physical activity or fat mass are strongly related during early childhood."
28615218,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft identifies several risk factors for back pain and suggests that physical activity may be an effective strategy to prevent or delay the occurrence of these painful conditions in older adults. He concludes by stating that smoking does not lead to reduced perfidation of tissues in nor around the spine; it also leads to reduced mechanical stress. However, there are other risk factors associated with back pain, including psychological distress and high blood pressure. The results suggest that exercise may be more effective in preventing low back pain than physical activity."
28371813,"The cost of a fall prevention program for older people is justified by the results. Although there was no reduction in hospital costs as a consequence of the exercise program, this does not seem to have a significant impact on the overall cost of the intervention. Costs were more expensive than other preventative measures. All three fall prevention approaches had a positive net return on investment. In particular, the home exercise program was more cost-effective than many other medical interventions and could be used as an evidence-base for primary care decision making."
28614164,"Bennett et al. present the results of a preseason observational risk-assessment of young male pace bowlers to determine whether they are at high risk for injury during the season. He concludes by comparing the scores of the three most commonly used tests for injury prediction: the overhead Squat score, the Dostoevsky Athletic Score, and the Shortlyite Lateral Hurl test to those of other competitive male players. The results suggest that these tests may be more sensitive than the Composite Score to predict running injuries in female runners. Conclusions In this paper, Bennett discusses the use of movement assessment tools as a means of predicting injury in men and women."
17164942,"In this chapter, the authors discuss the different types of alcohol dependent patients who respond to a variety of anti-serotonin drug regimens. They conclude that there may be ""subtypes"" of people who respond more poorly to these regimens than those who respond better to other treatment approaches. For example, someone who is addicted to alcohol might not respond as well to opium or sertraline while someone with an alcoholism background might respond differently to both treatments. The only thing that seems to work in this study is lamotrigine, which has a good effect on chronic PTSD but does not seem to have any significant effects on symptoms specific to psychiatric disease. Paxetine can be used as a stand-alone treatment for adults with a history of traumatic experiences. Mirtzapine appears to be more effective than either medication in treating a patient's presenting symptoms and general anxiety. Both drugs are safe and efficacious in treating severe PTSD from combat wounds."
21529374,"This paper focuses on the effects of high-protein, low-calium diets on bone health in women. Although there is no association between adult and child-bearing, it does suggest that increased consumption of animal or red meat may lead to greater risk of fracture in older women. Women with higher dietary ratios of animal and vegetable protein are more likely to develop hip fracture than those with lower rations of these two groups. In addition, young women with an excessively high nutrient content tend to have less rapid loss of neck bone as a result of their elevated phosphorus levels. These results suggest that ""higher fruit and vegetables"" might be beneficial for bone health but do not seem to affect overall bone mineral status. The authors conclude that ""phosphorous and proteolytic"" diets should not be associated with increased bone loss because they are too acidic. They also note that dry plums appear to exert positive effects upon bone health when consumed in combination with other foods."
28330835,"The AlereNet heart failure patient management system is a promising new approach to improving patients' health. It reduces the need for frequent hospitalizations and increases the frequency of follow-up visits. Telemedicine can be used as a cost-effective alternative to traditional medical care. However, it does not lead to significant reductions in readmissions or costs. In addition, this study shows that nurses can improve outcomes in patients with high-risk heart failure."
27629776,"Congestive Heart Failure Despite its beneficial effects, warfarin does not have a significant effect on patients with severe heart failure. Aspirin is not effective or safe for patients with mild-to-severe heart failure in the presence of a reduced left ventricular fraction. Antithrobolic therapy seems to be associated with improved long- term survival in this population of severe congestive hearts failure. The addition of aspirin to conventional therapy reduces the risk of death and morbidity among these patients."
27591453,"This paper concludes a previous study on topiramates in bipolar patients. Although it showed some anti-manic effects, it did not show any significant weight loss or changes in blood pressure or glucose tolerance."
29042383,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to treating patients with Type 2 and Type 3 diabetes. They use a combination of lifestyle changes and physical exercise to improve blood sugar control in patients with both acute and chronic disease. The results are mixed, but there is some evidence that short-term intervention can be more effective than long-term regimens. This paper also discusses the use of group care for patients with severe heart disease. It concludes that ""culturely competent"" or ""distribution-based"" self-management methods may be more successful than traditional approaches because they do not involve patient education. However, it does not seem to have any significant positive effects on A1c levels after 6 years of treatment. Furthermore, these studies suggest that brief intervention for risk factormodification in patients who have coronary heart diseases could lead to improved functional outcome."
26733622,"Necitumab improves survival in advanced patients with lung-cancer disease when paired with pemetrixed or cispaned chemotherapy. In addition, Nvvo is shown to be more effective than other agents in terms of time-relational parameters and quality of life; however, it does not improve overall survival for patients with small cell lung tumors. A randomized phase 3 trial is being conducted in which gefitinnib is used as the first line treatment for advanced non-Squamous lung cancer. The outcome of this study suggests that molecularly targeted therapy may be an appropriate firstline treatment for these patients."
26769120,"This paper presents the results of a prospective, randomized, open-label, single-blind, parallel-experimentation study evaluating the use of an E-Mystified Self-Monitoring system in bipolar patients. The results suggest that ""electronic selfmonitoring"" may have utility as a treatment for bipolar disorder but need further refinement before it is adopted."
26219990,"This paper describes a novel exercise intervention for patients with cyphoid fever. It uses a mixed-injured patient population as controls and compares the effects of an eight-week, moderate-intensity exercise program to those of a one-month regimen. The results suggest that this type of exercise can improve lung function and health in patients with chronic obstructive fever."
26443336,"This paper focuses on the association between dairy consumption and increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. It uses a pooled genetic-tracking approach to identify which dairy products are most effective for preventing Type 2 disease. In particular, it suggests that high-fat dairy products such as Greek Yogurt may be more effective in preventing blood Type 2 than other forms of dietary intervention."
31432431,"In this chapter, we present a detailed account of the relationship between appetite and energy in healthy young and elderly subjects. We conclude that age-related changes in blood concentrations of cyclic gonadal-cholerae type are associated with an increase in the concentration of circulating cklords, which may be involved in slowing gastricempting. This is due to the fact that older people tend to have more sensitivity to CCK-inducing effects than younger people."
24370846,"In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the effects of different forms of diets on body composition and blood lipids. We find that men on high-fritose/high-glucoses diets do not show any changes in these parameters. However, in the hypocaloric time, both high fiscose or high glutose regimens produce significant increases in all of these values without any significant differences between the two groups. This suggests that an energy-based approach to preventing disease is more likely to be effective than a ""specific Macnutrient-Mediated"" effect."
31076817,"In this study, Wu et al. concludes that there is little evidence for the efficacy of vitamin K in preventing bone loss in older women. The results suggest that it may be useful to use high-intension training to prevent bone loss from occurring in women with Osteopatra's disease. Women who have not been given adequate amounts of both calcium and vitamin K are at greater risk of developing fractures than those who do not receive these treatments."
31805963,"Prebiotics have a beneficial effect on the gut, but there are still some drawbacks. Probiotics can be used along with lifestyle changes to help control blood sugar levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Inulin is an effective treatment for both type 2 and non-diabetic patients. However, these studies do not provide any evidence for the use of probiotics as part of a total weight loss strategy."
28436684,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a recent study. We conclude that Profluss is an efficacious triple therapy for treating patients with cyphoid prostatic lesions. It has been shown that Saw palmerto extract can be used as a stand-alone or in combination with other anti-inflammatory agents such as Hesser. Furthermore, it does not provide any additional benefits. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of serenoarepens on the treatment of patients with benign prostatichyperplasia. A mixed-effects model was used to predict the effects of different treatments on different groups of patients. For example, Ser-se-ly and Tamsulosesin were more effective than monotherapies in reducing symptoms in patients with bummed out pituitary disease. However, there was no significant association between these two treatments."
27089322,Conclusions This paper supports the authors' previous theory that bipolar disorder is a separate disorder with at least some different pathogenetic mechanism and suggests that the 35-percent CO2 test may be useful as a tool for distinguishing between these two disorders.
29947999,"In this paper, we present the results of a double-blind, quackery-controlled study in which we assess the efficacy of three different treatments for knee Ostearthritis: 1) conventional spa therapy; 2) short wave therapy; and 3) mud pack therapy. We conclude that these two treatments are highly effective in treating knee patients."
17054240,"In this paper, we summarize the results of our previous studies on the efficacy and safety of vagal maneuvering. We conclude that both the vagal signal and reenterrant circuit are essential to maintaining or ending PSVT. The most frequently adverse response is hypotension, but only four patients have symptoms associated with hypotension. Therefore, IV ditiumzem in dosages of 0.5, 0.2, and 0.4mg/kg is safe and effective for the acute treatment of SVT; furthermore, it has a beneficial effect on TXA-2/Tas ratio. This study shows that Adenosol exerts a protective effect on the heart."
26203172,"In this paper, Dr. Manette argues that the evidence for improved school attendance in India is limited because of the small sample size and the high risk of biased treatment. This paper also discusses the use of deworming to improve health in impoverished countries."
26387860,"In this paper, we describe the use of a novel molecular analyte technique to track the concentration of small amounts of chemicals directly from soft tissues without harmful effects. We conclude that it is important to use this technique in the treatment of patients with myofacial pain syndrome because it can be used as a stand-alone test for different types of pain. It is also important to note that there are no known side-effects associated with this technique."
28053857,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to improving motor function in patients who have had a stroke. They use bihemisputic tdcs and peripheral sensimotor activities to improve motor function after stroke. The results are as good as those reported in other studies. Preparation for arm function at 6 months is now possible. Brain biomarkers such as the Fagl-Myyer score can be used to predict arm function later in the treatment period."
31869370,"This paper describes the results of a prospective, observational study of women with atrial fistia. The results suggest that women with af have higher risk of death and stroke than men, but that treatment and intervention specifically affect these outcomes."
27120555,"This paper discusses the results of a recent systematic review of depression treatment in adults with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. It concludes that psychological treatment can be more effective than usual care for patients with mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms. However, it is important to note that there are some drawbacks in the reporting of these studies: reporting bias may be an underrecognized problem; trials should not be overexamined because of missing outcome evidence. Conclusions Cbt depression treatment is particularly effective in treating depressed patients who have poor control of their blood sugar levels. In addition, the intervention improves physical health by reducing waist circumference among older African American patients. The consolrification group develops a new version of the Self-Reporting Questionnaire used in the DAD study."
27418186,"Conclusions In this study, we conclude that consumption of sugarsweetened beverages is associated with an increased risk of Type 2D and some adverse effects in lipid profiles, inflammatoryfactors, and Leptin; however, artificially sweetened beverages do not appear to be associated with such risks. Conscious of the potential protective role of whole grains, cereal fiber, and  diet magnesium in the disease of older women, we suggest that daily consumption of these foods is likely to increase the risk of heart disease. Short-term consumption does not seem to have any deleterious effect on primary prevention of Type 2, although it may lead to weight gain or obesity when consumed at high levels of sugar."
27820504,"Conclusions In this paper, we present the results of a three-month follow-up study on patients with mild to moderate schizotypal disease. We found that patients were better tolerated and more satisfied with their treatment when compared to physicians' conclusions about their efficacy or side effects. This is important because it allows us to see how patients respond to antipsychotic drugs in real time."
23832767,"In this paper, Anderson discusses the benefits and drawbacks of using a patient-centered approach to informed consent in breast surgery. He concludes that it is important for surgeons to provide patients with adequate information before they undergo an ecclesopatra's procedure. However, Anderson does not report any significant differences between groups in satisfaction or anxiety over the use of decision aids. Although both groups receive improved knowledge about the risks associated with their procedures, there is no difference in the satisfaction or anxiousness among the two groups. Both groups are more satisfied with the decision aid than those who do not have written consent. This study furthermore suggests that physicians should be given greater time to obtain informed consent from their patients."
25985324,"Six-week weight loss leads to a significant reduction in both visfatin, BMI, and waist circumference. However, there is no strong association between changes in these two groups. For example, Mediterranean diets are associated with higher concentrations of aponectin than those from a high-fat diet. The only predictor of insulin resistance in overweight women is the presence of visible adispose tissue; however, this does not lead to dramatic weight loss. In contrast, moderate weight loss induces an improvement in Insulin Sensitivity independent of body composition. This suggests that short-term exercise may be more effective in treating older adults with Type 2 diabetes than long-term calorie restriction."
25818951,"In this paper, Wu uses a case-control study to examine the effects of a Mediterranean diet on blood pressure and body composition in young adults. The results suggest that consumption of whole-favored fat dairy products may be associated with lower blood pressure in healthy young people."

26853814,Sesame oil reduces blood pressure and improves lipid profile in patients with Type 2 diabetes.
26675773,"This paper concludes that no psychological well being measures were associated with the weight gain outcome. The only predictors are increased food consumption and takeaway-consumption. However, maternal nutrient composition does have a significant effect on weight gain in pregnant women. Consuming too much refined food can lead to excessive weight gain but is not associated with adverse pregnancy consequences. Women who follow the International Meal Outcomes or IOM recommendations lose more weight during pregnancy than those who do not."
28985620,"This paper focuses on the association between elevated levels of both prolin and alpha-adione in patients with acute solitary fever. It concludes by stating that although there is no concluding evidence for this association, it does seem to be supported by several studies that have examined the relationship between these two anti-sle drugs."
26306578,"In this paper, we present a detailed description of the effects of two different types of alpha-betaining agents on blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Both are shown to be effective at reducing blood pressure during exercise and as a preventive measure against hypotension. The effect of these three drugs on blood flow is described in this paper. Although both are well tolerated, they have some side effects. Bendro fluazide is more effective than all the other antihypertinesive agents except for atenolalol."
29206166,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the safety and efficacy of physical exercise for patients with hemodylysis. It shows that home-based exercises are more effective than supervised regimens, especially in reducing risk factors associated with falls among older adults who live in their nursing home. Conscious of the importance of gait speed as a predictor of long-term hospitalization, this paper discusses the use of the Tug as an assessment tool."
29139110,"This paper uses a case-control study to examine the effects of a two-year cash transfer program on children's health in low-and middle- income countries. The results suggest that an unconditional cash transfers may be effective for reducing male and female risk of infection among poor women, particularly when used as part of combination preventive measures. In addition, it suggests that this type of intervention is likely to have positive spillover effects on social protection in terms of improving health outcomes for vulnerable children."
18254026,"The aims of this study are to describe the efficacy and safety of two different antihypertinesive drugs in patients with severe hypertension. In particular, it is concluded that both drugs can be used effectively in treating these acutely ill patients. Although there are some side effects, no significant difference in blood pressure between the two groups, they all agree that each drug should be used according to the severity of the patient's condition."

26272731,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft et al concludes that in clinical practice, minor and major bleeding events are similar to those seen in randomized controlled trials. Conclusions On the other hand, patients with acute or chronic coronary disease have greater risk for major bleeding than those who receive no treatment. This is because of the high risk of complications after percutaneous intervention."
15495002,"In this paper, the effects of a single daily dose of ascorbbic acid on cold-induced symptoms are examined in two pairs of healthy adults. The first group takes a well-matched placebo for 100 days and results in a significant reduction in the severity of cold episodes. The second group takes only a small portion of the recommended daily allowance of vitamin C. This does not appear to have any significant effect on patients with severe colds. A double blinded study examines the efficacy of high-dose ascorbicacin for the treatment of respiratory infection. It was found that subjects who took higher doses received less colds than those who took lower doses. However, there were no side effects from these large doses; they did not seem to increase the severity or duration of colds either."
17467103,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the use of evidence-based, patient-centered approaches to treatment for patients with chronic fatigue. It concludes that exercise is effective in relieving pain and improving quality of life in patients with moderate-to-severe forms of amyofascia. In particular, it suggests that exercise can be used as a preventative measure against future flare-ups of symptoms."
24524660,"The Dermatology-specific quality of life measure, the European Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30, is a good predictor of health status in patients with mild to moderately sprained psolias. In addition, it improves well-being for women undergoing treatment for breastcancer. This study furthermore suggests that the EQ5D might be useful as a prognostic measure in future trials of patients who have moderate to severe disease."
32259613,"The results of a three-month study indicate that a paleolithic, low-glycian diet improves blood pressure and several other risk factors in patients with Type 2 diabetes. In contrast, the conventional diet does not have any significant effect on these risk factors. Both diets result in reductions in both Hba1c levels and changes in body weight. Conclusions: hypertension is common among newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics, and may be associated with obesity; further studies need to determine the long term effects of this intervention. A vegan diet reduces body weight but also has a beneficial effect on anthropometry and metabolic characteristics of patients with type 2, especially those with prediscompositional disease."
29381992,"This paper presents a meta-analysis of the literature on the effects of conventional lifestyle intervention on metabolic level. It shows that although substantial weight loss is achieved overall, there is no significant interaction between diet quality and ir status."
17923128,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effects of transderebrial and oral oestrandol on postmenopalusal women. They conclude that there is a reduction in the risk of heart attack among women treated with both short-term and long-term therapy. After six years, however, the rate of new CHD events does not increase among females treated with either type of treatment. However, after a further year's follow-up, the relative risk of stroke, hip fracture, and chest disease remains unchanged."
32066446,"In this paper, we present the results of a double-blind, quarrelling study. We conclude that reveratrol can be used as an anti-dissipation agent in patients with Type 2D. It has been shown that it can reduce blood glucose levels and improve lipid profiles in subjects with both Type 2 and Type 2DM. However, there is little evidence for its efficacy in treating these conditions."
28668150,"In this study, the effects of cyclic or continuous Oc-pills on pain symptoms in patients with rectogonal endometriostis are investigated. The results suggest that these treatments can be more effective than surgical treatment alone. Furthermore, it is concluded that long-term use of Oc pills can significantly reduce the severity and frequency of relapses of endogenosis associated pain. A pilot study was performed to determine whether anastrozol, a vaginally-administered anti-estrogening agonist, could be used as a treatment for women with theirtologically proved rectovagnal lesions. After six months of follow-up, there were no significant increases in frequency of either group. Conclusions dienogeth 2 mg/ day orally demonstrated equal efficacy at depot leuproline; however, slightly more patients complained of legaches during the 12 months following treatment. An insert of a pronto levolorid-releasing Iud alleviates painful and reduces size of lessions in patients who have endorotic lesions of the sternum. This opens-label"
30377714,"The results of this study suggest that the use of patient-specified instrumentation, such as PSI, is not superior to conventional instruments in terms of improving mechanical stability and accuracy. However, it does reduce blood loss and time in the primary tangle-reduction group. Furthermore, there is no significant difference in the mean operation time or blood loss when using PSI versus conventional instruments."
26231111,"This paper focuses on the relationship between early childhood exposure to screentime and health outcomes in children. It concludes that parents should be encouraged to make informed decisions about their children's exposure to this type of media. Children who are not allowed to watch more than three hours a day have an increased risk of developing hyperactivity and inattention later in life. However, further research is needed to identify the association between these two types of behavior."
26103637,"This paper concludes that there is little effect of a stretching program on ankle injury risk. In contrast, wearing the keresio tape for an extended period of time leads to improved proprioception in both subjects. These improvements are not related to ankle instability."
23250273,"In this paper, Wutherings focuses on the effects of physical activity on pre-primertal children. He concludes that there is little effect of school transportation on bone mineral or growth in these children over two years. However, it does seem to have an effect on the amount of time students spend walking to school. The results show that overweight and obesity are common among schoolchildren and young adults in Tiannjin. There are three key factors that can be used to prevent overweight: change in lifestyle, high social economic status, parental obesity, and maternal health. These factors may be appropriate for future treatment in Brazil."
29043392,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to improving bone health in older women with fractures. They describe an exercise program that improves both physical and mental health for older adults with high risk of fall and fracture. This intervention is based on a patient-centered, evidence-based approach. The patients receive better treatment than their usual care group; however, there is still a significant gap in the knowledge and practice of treating fractures among these patients. These results suggest that physicians should be more attentive to patients with fragile fractures because they are at greater risk of falling."
30782186,"The results of this study are summarized in this paper. After five years, the patients had no preference for either the fabricated or the conventionally fabricated prosthesis. There was no significant difference in histological outcome after the initial two-year follow up. However, the prostheses did not have any significant differences in long-term survival and functional outcome. This report encourages further studies on the use of these new devices."
31528342,"Conclusions In this paper, we describe the results of a large-scale observational study on eating disorder and mental health in bipolar patients. We conclude that an inexpensive, easily dissedeminated lifestyle intervention may reduce onset of depression among those at the highest risk of developing a mental illness. This intervention was accepted by the young people who had been refered to for treatment. Such an intervention could prevent future disease risks and improve life expectancy for people with serious mental illnesses."
18986755,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective, observational study on patients who had undergone radical retropox. We conclude that there is a significant improvement in the IIEF-erectile functions domain score with the combined treatment of ic-pge1-50mg sildenanafil than with id-phosphodiesterase Type 5 inhibitors alone or placebo. This suggests that it is important for surgeons to select adequate morphinergic and penile-injection therapy for their patients. After nerve sparing prostatectomy, spontaneous eryections were observed in only four % of those treated by placebo. These results confirm our belief that retrospective reviews of intraoperative tapes may have great promise. Conclusions That early postoperative drug administration improves the return of spontaneous ersection after radical retro pubic prostatute. A combination of vasostatic and intracaversal injections greatly increases the rate of spontaneous response after roostoplasty. Conscious of the potential complications associated with the use of these newer approaches, we recommend that all patients with severe erectility be considered for soldenafil Cirate"
21266418,"In this paper, the authors present evidence that a lack of adequate daily dietary supply is associated with low blood levels of vitamin D. They suggest that breastfed infants in China should be given a sufficient amount of orally-administered vitamin D as it is difficult to obtain high concentrations of 25-hydroxyvintomin D from these infants. The results suggest that maternal milk may have been responsible for low maternal vitamin D content and that there is a need for better evidence concerning the risk of bone mineral deficiation in children and young adults."
29018544,"In this paper, the authors present a set of evidence-based conclusions regarding the use of task-specific and augmentation-based feedback to reduce injury risk in men. They conclude that visual cues are more effective than other methods for reducing injury risk because they can be used as both a preventative tactic and an immediate reminder of how to do things. Furthermore, they suggest that using augmentations to improve ankle control may lead to improved performance on different training tasks."
29326185,"Conclusions The results of the first two studies suggest that there is a significant decrease in the risk of death from coronary disease in Canada between 1994 and 2005, but this does not account for changes in medical treatments. A larger, more powerful study needs to be performed to determine whether the use of targeted performance-reporting approaches can lead to faster care improvements than those reported by standard reports. However, it is clear that these reports do not lead to rapid improvement in patient care."
31080644,"This paper presents the results of a prospective, randomized, open-label, single-blind, cross-sectional study of patients who had undergone an erassive treatment for eophageal malignancies. The results showed that EDA was highly effective in reducing the risk of complications and long-term morbidity. In addition, it reduced the length of hospital stay as well as the severity of complications. Furthermore, this study showed that short-term follow-up was associated with improved recovery and reduction in post-opportune complications."
27124041,"The risk for anemia after ryb surgery is highest in womenstruating women, but continues to increase over the years. Conclusions and Reneval In mild to modely obese patients who have Type 2 diabetes, adding bariatic surgery to their lifestyle was associated with greater likelihood of meeting the composite goal of weight loss and improved medical management. At 1 year, ILI results in significant weight loss among people with Type 2 Diabetes. Both procedures improve general quality of life measures, but both treatments improve blood sugar control and risk factors. Long- term follow-up is necessary to confirm these conclusions."
27236454,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights et al. concludes that Piracetram is an effective treatment for speech-recovery in post- stroke patients. The effect of the drug on language functions is demonstrated by improved speed at letter naming and improved reading on the Word Retrieval test. This confirms previous results from other studies showing that nootropic agents can be used to treat brain function."
15674903,"This paper presents the results of a large-scale, long-term observational study on the efficacy of physical activity promotion for older adults. In particular, it is concluded that the stage-tattered print intervention was most effective in increasing short-term increases in physical activity; however, there were no significant differences between self-reported physical activity at 6 months and 12 months after the trial was ended. The aim of this study is to determine whether or not an exercise regimen can be used as a preventive measure against cardiovascular disease among older adults who are already physically active. It is furthermore concluded that patients with Type 2 diabetes should be encouraged to attend health walks during their workdays so that they can improve their health while also improving their fitness. Furthermore, these studies indicate that simple and relatively inexpensive nurses can motivate elderly people to walking for exercise. These studies suggest that ""minimal contact lifestyle intervention"" may have some beneficial effects on bone mineral denition but do not lead to any changes in blood pressure or risk of heart disease. A fully automated counsellor program has positive short- term effects on paternal health. Self-reevaluations and social liberation were more frequently used by the experimental group than those of control subjects."
30940176,"This paper focuses on the effects of a work-based physical activity intervention on health and well-being. It shows that workers are more physically active when they have an incentive to do so than when they don't, which suggests that employers can use wearable technology to help them increase their physical activity."
26658704,"This paper describes a number of different approaches to improving the health of Latinos with Type 2 Diabetes. The first is an education-based intervention that improves self-reported medication adherence, but not risk factor control. The second is a pharmacist-led program that helps patients meet evidence-based guideline for managing their disease. Finally, this study concludes that a culturely-tailored approach can reduce errands in African Americans who have Type 2 diabetes. It also suggests that using proctoras may result in positive results for Mexican American patients who have type 2, especially those with high fat diets or body massindex  35. In addition, it suggests that ""promotores-led"" and ""culturely-taught"" approaches are more effective than traditional methods because they focus on patient's values and feel of purpose."
28836492,"In this paper, we describe a novel approach to evaluating the effects of a low-carb diet on inflammatory markers in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 rheumatology. We conclude that a high-glycein diet is more effective in reducing both systemic and mild inflammation than a lower-caloric diet."
15206658,"In this single-blind, rat-controlled study, the safety and efficacy of fluoxetine were examined in patients with mild to moderate depression. Both fluoxetine and imipramine showed significant improvements on the Hamilton Depression Score after at least three weeks of treatment. However, side effects were more common among the two drugs than they were among the placebo group. The authors conclude that both bupropion or fluoxetine are effective in relieving symptoms of major depression but produce less adverse effects and are better tolerated"
26118568,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft eloquently describes the advantages and drawbacks of the direct anterior approach to hip resurfacing. He concludes by stating that there are no significant differences in the later post-operative results between groups. Post-operative complications seem to be relatively limited in the immediate post-opportunity."
25236305,"Losartan is a safe and effective treatment for children with moderate-to-severe hypertension. In addition, it has been reported that it can be used as a preventative measure against major events in the future. Children with moderate to severe hypertension are particularly at risk of stroke, heart attack, and kidney failure."
17943736,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to the treatment of peripheral artery disease. They suggest that consumption of extra virgin olive oil and fish oil together may be beneficial in terms of improving blood lipids as well as decreasing susceptible atherosis. Their results indicate that polyunstained fatty acids produce a significant reduced risk of coronary events but no benefit on other risk factors. A 16-week intervention with n-3 Polyunsulated Fatty acids induces an increase in TFpi plasma levels; however, it does not improve exercise time for patients with acutely thrombophilic disease. This study concludes that bezafide has no effect upon the incidence of Coronary Heart Disease and of Stroke Conversation but may reduce both the severity of the disease and the frequency of fatal events. The trial recruits quite a large number of eligible patients who are expected to benefit from its results. Atorvastain is more effective than ticlopudium in improving pain free walking distances in patients with persistent claudicatory disease. Both drugs are well tolerated and most adverse events are mild. Although ceriva statin is highly effective, it lack"
26027632,"Conclusions A short-term exercise program is preferable to long-term supervised exercise in patients with chronic claudicular disease because adherence and cost are lower. Home-based exercise does not improve walking speed or quality of life, but it improves functional capacity and Quality of Life in people with Type I and Pulmonary Arthritis. The Vascuqol test is used as an outcome measure for patients who have moderately recurrent papillary thrombosis. Conscious that home-based exercises do not improve Walking Speed and Quality Of Life, surgeons should consider using these measures as outcome measures for future trials and follow up of patients with PDA."
28294172,"In this paper, we describe the effect of long-term acorbic acid therapy on patients with Type 2 Diabetes. The results suggest that ascorbbic acid may be an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes because it delays the body's release of glucosins from the pancreas and reduces the risk of developing Type 2 disease. This paper also discusses the use of ascorbicic acid in treating Type 2 diabetics. It is reported that high doses of alcibiade can improve blood sugar control in people with Type 2, but there is no significant association between alclad citric acid and elevated blood glucose levels in these patients."
31095078,"This paper focuses on the effect of walking for 20 minutes three days a week on risk factors for cardiovascular disease in previously ssedentary women. It finds that an increase in MVPa was associated with larger decreases in body fat, but no changes in BMI or VAT in Latinos compared to Latino adults. Plasma tbars significantly decrease after 20 weeks among the long-beast group and tends to decrease in the short-betroth group. The results support the hypothecy that exercise can be used as a preventative measure against weight gain during physical restraint. Short bouts are more effective than longer bouts because they provide greater health benefits than shorter bouts."
21127200,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of job-stressed workstations on patients with lumbar pain. While both groups experience significant reductions in pain, symptoms, and function over three months, they do not show an improvement in any other outcome measures. For example, there is no relation between manual work and Epicondylus at one year's follow-up. However, Anderson concludes that ""psychological distress"" and somatic symptoms play a key role in predicting upper-limb pain. He suggests that workers should take frequent breaks to help relieve their pain. This seems to be a good strategy for relieving pain caused by repetitive strain injuries."
26972954,"Conclusions This paper focuses on evidence-based approaches to improving the health of patients with Type 2 diabetes. In particular, it discusses the use of case-based training for primary care physicians and suggests that this approach may be more cost effective than other approaches. It concludes by stating that in primary care, ""individualised goals"" with education and surveillance support can reduce risk factors of type 2 patients without gain of weight. A pharmacist-led intervention improves blood pressure and HbA1,1c levels but does not lead to significant improvements in overall patient satisfaction."
17010257,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the effects of iron-fortification on children's health and growth. He concludes that daily iron is better than weekly in improving anemia but does not improve growth in children who are deficient in iron or zinc. Iron fortified foods can be used to prevent iron from deficiating in infants because they have higher concentrations of iron than other food groups. However, these studies do not show any positive effects on child growth."
27273067,"In this paper, the authors present a cross-sectional study of barley as an effective food for reducing blood triglyceria and reducing risk of cardiovascular disease. They conclude that adding barley fiber to a diet can reduce both LDL-cholesterol levels and total cholesterol in moderately hypercholesteremic subjects. This suggests that using barley's high content of glucan may be an effective way to lower these risk factors."
28107561,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft discusses the efficacy and safety of ramipril in treating hypertension. He concludes that it is more effective than alkyne for reducing both blood pressure and mortality in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The results are not as strong as those seen in other studies. Acute strokes occur in a large number of patients treated with either metorolol or captoprila. Both drugs have significant reductions in blood pressure but do not reduce the risk of major events. Although there is some evidence that these two drugs can be used together to prevent acute strokes, physicians must carefully consider their patient's specific needs before making any decisions about treatment."
25164349,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft discusses the different types of gallstone disease and explains how they relate to each other. He concludes that gallstones are more common in younger people than in older people. Wolstonecraft uses a model to predict whether or not patients will experience recurrent gallstone pain after an elective laparotomy. The results suggest that conservative treatment is still preferable for patients who have bilary pain but no other gastrointestinal symptoms. A randomized double-blind study comparing the cost-utility of laparoscopic open choecystenectomy with conventional management of acute gallbrodder disease is presented."
25865603,"The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a three-question, cross-sectional study of the validity of the ""Toronto CSS"" as an instrument for assessing the severity and severity of chronic rheumatia. The results suggest that the CSS may be useful as an endpoint for future studies of chronic pain treatment. Acute somatotrophic pain has a negative impact on function status and health in older adults; the magnitude of interference increase with increasing pain intensity. The values of the Short Pain Inventory provide support for four easily interpretable sub scales: continuous pain, intermittent pain, predominant neuropathy pain, and affectively descriptords"
30187695,"In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, short-term weight bearing exercises appear to slow the progression of joint damage. This may be due to the protective effects that these exercises have on the joints. Walking, swimming, and other forms of exercise also seem to have beneficial effects on quality of life in patients with severe axspa. These effects are further explored in another larger trial. The ASDA is a highly discriminating instrument for evaluating disease activity in assassinated patients."
25456506,"Conclusions In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to treating patients with chronic heart failure by using a combination of molecular and irrational approaches. They use a patient-controlled, randomized, blinded trial to assess the efficacy of cathter ablation for improving LV function in patients who have persistent af or a history of recurrent atrial fibrillation."
14576382,"The narrator discusses the benefits and drawbacks of early intervention for acute stroke. He concludes by stating that although the mechanism by which antigtensin Type 1 affects blood pressure is still unknown, early nervehumoral inhibition can have similar beneficial effects on cerebral and inomycardial ischemic events. In contrast, early blockade has no significant effect on mortality. A combination of diuretics, beta blockers, or perindopriml produces larger blood-pressure reductions than does single drug therapy alone. This conclusion emphasizes that supplemental information on the efficacy of these two agents before a large trial of them in patients who are manifested with cerebrovasive disease can be started. Although conventional treatment does not improve blood pressure, Losartan reduces it significantly."
28264715,"The results of this large, randomized study suggest that the use of drugs such as digoxin is associated with lower risk of mortality in patients who receive rate control treatment. Conclusions In this random population of patients with atrium fibrillation, there is little evidence for using these drugs to prevent death or morbidity. Aflutter is another common and frequent complication of atrial fillation."
23927840,"The AlereNet heart failure patient management program reduces the rate of re hospitalization and costs by telephoning nurses to manage patients in their own homes. In addition, it improves quality of life for patients who receive home-based care. Nurses are also more likely to be able to prevent readmissions because they have better knowledge of how to treat patients with severe heart failure. Telemedicine is associated with improved health outcomes as well as cost savings. A six-month multidisciplinary approach can improve important medical management at a comparable cost in newly hospitalized high risk patients with heart failing. Home-based intervention was associated with improvement in endpoints of mortality and rates of hospitalization; however, this did not result in any reduction in all cause mortality. Further studies need to be performed on older adults with advanced heart disease."
30283040,"Conclusions Post-operative thrombing in patients with a persistent decline in their endometrial function is associated with an increase in the risk of cardiovascular events. In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective, rat-human model of post-epithelial scar formation following laminectomy. We conclude that topical aspirin can be used to prevent such formation in rats and further studies need to be performed to determine the best dosage and safety of Aspirin. Four weeks simvastain treatment reduces mesnagial tyrannical TF and pai1 mRNA but does not reduce the hospitalization for SBO during the first 24 hours after surgery. This suggests that future studies may need to use more potent statins than systemic administration before extrapolating into human therapy"
32274957,"In this paper, Concluson argues that the majority of people who use alternative medicine are not satisfied with their conventional medicine. Instead, they find these newer approaches to medicine to be more ""congruent"" with their own personal values, beliefs, and philosophical views toward health and well-being. Permixon is an effective first-line treatment for symptomatic men with lower Urinary Tract symptoms. However, it does not provide any additional benefits as a stand-alone treatment."
28899233,This paper focuses on the use of utility-based measures to assess quality of life in patients with a myopic view of their health. It uses a mixed-effects model to examine the relationship between utility values and mortality after a two-year follow-up period.
26442959,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to improving Type 2 diabetes care in primary care settings. They describe a patient-centered telemedicine intervention that improves blood glucose control and falls short of standard follow-up regimens for patients who do not use the new technology. The results are similar to those reported in other studies; however, there are some drawbacks: it does not improve A1c levels or body mass index as well as improved self-management. This is due to the small size of the sample and the lack of an adequate number of patients. However, the study concludes that ""telecare management intervention"" is more effective than any other type of treatment."
30463585,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the efficacy of a new physical activity program for pre-kilty children. It is shown that this program does not lead to significant changes in paga, but it does lead to some positive changes in other measures such as time spent outdoors and size of indoor space per child. The results of the Toybox study suggest that a longer period of time to implement the program might improve the effects of the program."
28796127,"In this paper, De la Motte uses a novel approach to identify risk factors for injury in men and women. She concludes by identifying multiple risk factors that can be used to predict whether an individual is at risk for injuries. These include: 1) low-level of physical fitness; 2) body composition; 3) overuse injuries; and 4) prior activity levels. This study supports previous studies on the association between exercise and injury risk. It also suggests that preseason strength tests may be useful for predicting injury risk among professional ice-hockey players."
20687074,"In this paper, the results of a prospective, randomized, international, multi-centre study are presented. The patients were randomized to two different treatment regimens: 1) once daily nidipine; 2) twice daily co-ampilozides; and 3) long acting nitedipine. After 12 months, blood pressure in the conventional group was 17/106 mmhg and 15/90 mhg at randomization. This trial will end on October 31, 1999, and final results will be released by mid- 2000."
25365192,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of a recent study on infants with hypothyroidism. We conclude that children should be given careful control over their daily dose of vitamin D during the first six months of treatment to prevent deficion from developing. A further study suggests that inhaling dry powder budesomide 400-mg daily may reduce the risk of influenza A in schoolchildren. The mean values for bone turnover and growth were obtained at two months after the second control test. Conclusions In asthma, reduced blood supply is associated with impairment of lung function, increased analgia, and reduced general response. These studies suggest that combined treatment of asthma with high-dose or low-dose ics may result in improved asthma severity and efficacy."
22617117,"The results of this study suggest that exercise-only or comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation may be more effective in reducing the risk of heart attack than is appropriate for patients who have undergone other forms of treatment. However, these studies do not show any significant effect on mortality or morbidity when compared to control groups. A second review of 181 patients with coronary disease concludes that there is no difference in death effect between exercise only or comprehensive cardial rehabilitation. In contrast, secondary prevention programmes reduce the rate of myocarital infa bastard ion by nearly twofold. Two further reviews report that education and counseling about Coronary Risk Factors with supervised exercise are associated with reductions in total mortality and acute myoCardial infacultation. This conclusion does not support the use of supervised exercises as a preventive measure against cardiovascular disease."
30872787,"In this chapter, the authors present a detailed description of the effects that vitamin D has on patients with hip fractures. They conclude that daily doses of 500 iu/d are more effective than 1,000 IU per day in increasing 25-hydroxyvindel concentrations in healthy young adults. However, they note that there is no difference in parathyroid Hormone levels between these two treatment regimens. The results suggest that daily dosages of 1000 IV/d may be sufficient to increase 25-OHD level in infants without any significant change in their health. This paper also discusses the role of sun exposure and exercise in improving bone health in women with low or inadequate levels of vitamin D. It suggests that pregnant women should consume an adequate amount of food for at least three months before starting pregnancy. Although it is difficult to obtain adequate amounts of food through a dietary counseling program, high-dose diets have been shown to improve blood flow and reduce risk of Type 2, Type 1, and other diseases. Furthermore, studies have suggested that children with poor or inadequate Vitamin D status should receive higher doses as well. These conclusions support the notion that excessive consumption of foods can lead to increased risk of disease."
24652601,"In this paper, the authors present evidence for the use of music therapy as an intervention for children with moderate-to-severely autistic spectrum disorder. They conclude by describing some of the most promising trials that have been conducted in the field. For example, one study suggests that music therapy can be used to improve language and social skills in young adults with mild to moderately severe ASD. Two other studies suggest that parents may be more satisfied with their children's improved social skills than they are with their own. The first is a randomized, controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of ""Junior Detective Training"" for improving social skills among children with high-familiarity diagnoses. It was found that children with low levels of time 1 object interest showed greater gains in imitation than those with higher objects exploration. However, there were no significant effects on self-reporting or parent-reported social behavior. Children with Pervasive Developmental Disorder Nos may gain more than those who have autism; however, these children do not show any improvement in their social skills. Instead, they show improvements in intelligence, verbal comprehension, language, and academic performance. These results support the validity of using"
28387560,"In this paper, the authors present a review of the current evidence for the use of neuropsychological tests as predictors of post-concussion symptoms in patients with traumatic brain injuries. They conclude that players who have had previous head injuries are at greater risk of developing concusses than those who have no history. A further study suggests that using vision-based measures to assess performance on balance and mental function improves the detection of sideline injury. The results of this study suggest that returning to play may not be possible because of short-term psychological and posturgy deficits following concupssion."
21835653,"This paper presents the results of a prospective, cross-sectional survey of patients with a myoscial pain disorder. Although most patients report no pain at all, some suffer from more than one type of pain. The study concludes that the Myoscal Pain Questionnaire is highly reliable for predicting the presence of pain in patients with this disorder."
30264226,"In this paper, Van der Linden et al. concludes that vigorous exercise can improve attention in children with and without symptoms of ADHD. He also discusses the use of doses of nature as an alternative treatment for children with hyperactive disorder."
27390451,"The results of this study suggest that an exercise program targeted at balance, leg strength, and frozen gait does not reduce falls. However, it does improve psychological and physical health in patients with moderate to severe PD. Conclusions A further study is needed to determine whether the use of tai chi training can be used as an additional treatment for patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease."
28854319,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effects of early-infancy feeding on the risk of neonatal complications in preterm and very low-birth weight infants. They conclude that early feeds are safe and do not increase the chance of developing necrotising Enterocolitis in prematurely weighed infants with a gestational weight greater than 1250g. Although there is some disagreement as to whether enteral feeding should be increased or slowed, these results suggest that rapid advances may be more effective in reducing the severity of the disease."
24214202,"The results of the laparoscopic rhybectomy in patients with severe obesity are described. At one year after surgery, weight loss is experienced and improvements in blood pressure are noted. Conclusions: Laparoscopic RHYGB is safe and can be used as an alternative to open gbb in severely obese patients. In addition, it reduces the risk of heart attack by reducing the burden of hypercholestrolemia. Furthermore, this study suggests that laparotomy may be more effective in treating patients with moderate-to-severe obesity."
28379397,"Conclusions The combination of behavior-middle-learning with blood glucose and lifestyle-behavior measures individually analyzed, presented with evidence-based guidelines to physicians substantially reduced  Glycated Hebogen levels over one year. Consequences An IHCA is acceptable for patients with Type 2 diabetes. However, further research needs to be done on whether an IHCa can achieve behavior change and improve health outcomes."
28434446,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of our previous studies on peri-stretched atrial fibrillation. Conclusions conclude that it is not possible to predict permanent long-term results for patients who have been treated with PVI alone. However, additional left-line lesions are more successful in maintaining a normal sympathetic response after PVI than after additional SM; furthermore, early relapses seem to be associated with negative outcome after both approaches. Concliusions compares the time and intensity of the ablation procedure with those of other treatment approaches such as fluoroscopies and irrigated electrodes. The efficacy of these two approaches seems to be dependent on the patient's severity of adolescence."
27454460,"Conclusions This paper summarizes the results of a long-term follow-up study on periodontal surgery. In this paper, we describe the efficacy of two different approaches to treating gingival recedes: 1) using light molecular abduction and 2) using caf or adjunctive applicator under a caf. Both treatments result in improved patient comfort and reduced morbidity when used in combination with Mcat. Conscious of the limitations of these two approaches, however, conclusively conclude that they are highly effective in treating both types of defects."
16354303,"In this single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial, we assess the safety and efficacy of SildenAfil citrate in men with Erectile Dysis of a Broad Spectrum of Aetesiology. Conclusions The use of cross-sectional designs for evaluating treatment effects should be avoided since it leads toexaggerated estimations of treatment effect; furthermore, the Type of study designed should be taken as consideration when assessing methodological quality of drug trials in inference. Sildenanafil is highly effective in improving both erectility and patient satisfaction. Men with severe sedation are well tolerated but have frequent adverse events including headache, flushing, and dizzyness. This study does not involve any sponsoring. Most frequently treated adverse events are headache or flushing which are milder than those reported in other patients. Vardennafil improves all five domains of ED function except for the ""sensible"" and ""broad-spectrum"" domains. These results suggest that there may be an advantage in using sildeninafil instead of placebo in treating men with heptomia."
18725372,"In this paper, the authors present evidence for the efficacy of atorvastain in reducing the risk of post-elective cardiac surgery. They conclude that it is important to use statins as an anti-inflammatory agent in patients with a history of recurrent or permanent ailment."
25414824,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of a weight-loss program on Type 2 diabetes. He concludes by stating that it is possible to use meat as a risk factor for both type 1 and Type 2 disease. Although previous studies have suggested that eating meat may be beneficial in some circumstances, there has not been sufficient evidence to support such an association. This paper uses a case-control study to examine the association between a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet and changes in blood lipid levels in patients with Type 2 who are not overweight."
22457397,"In this paper, we examine the effect of a high-florose diet on gout risk in men. We conclude that consumption of sweeten soft drinks and fruit may increase the risk of heart disease because they are high in glycerics and have a tendency to increase lipoprotein concentrations."
29951975,"In this study, the effect of a root canal sealer on the resistance of single-rooted teeth is examined. The results suggest that the use of Resilon and Epiphany as root fillers may be more effective in reducing the risk of tooth fracture than guttapercha or sealer. Conclusions furthermore conclude that all the root dentine sealers tested in this study increase the strength of root filled teeth. However, none of these sealers improves the resistance to severe root fractures. Furthermore, periodontal Ligament simulation does not affect the bond strength of any of the cements used for root filling. Thus, it is considered an appropriate material to use in endodontic treatments."
30915521,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of our previous studies. We conclude that a high level of IL- 6 is associated with increased susceptibility to heart attack in apparently healthy men. Conclusions furthermore suggest that licentitine may have some potential utility in reducing inflammation in cadaveric patients. Furthermore, alcarnitine seems to have a beneficial effect on body weight, blood pressure, and other metabolic and inflammatory markers. This study also suggests that l-carntine can be used as an anti-inflammation agent."
28356652,"The Co-Optimization Questionnaire is used to assess the efficacy of a combination of physical and psychological therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain. Both groups show significant improvements in their performance after two weeks of treatment. However, both groups report that they are satisfied with their abilities to do shoes."
28816346,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft argues that the results of IV sk regimens are not sufficient to prevent heart attack in people with pre-CVD. However, it is possible that some patients will be able to co-inject B vitamins into their diets for several years before any real effect on mortality can be seen. For example, one study suggests that daily b-Vitamine supplementation may reduce stroke risk by up to 31 percent among hypertenive adults without history of major Cardio diseases. The authors conclude that ""folate acid at 1mg/d do not reduce color denoma risk"" and suggest further studies need to be performed regarding the effects of folate as well as other anti-cancer agents."
23140091,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to knee replacement using a combination of cement-coated prostheses and an encapsulated haloete. They report that after 12 months, they have achieved safe results in total kneearthroplasty with no complications. After 8 years, however, there is still a significant increase in the risk of revision due to excessive loosening of the prosthesis."
29203269,"Conclusions Prostate-cancer specific mortality is low despite the different treatments. Men with localized disease have a reduced risk of death if treated with rebrt or ADT, compared to those who receive curative treatment. Conscious that men with locally advanced disease may be at greater risk of developing metastases after their treatment, it is recommended that they be encouraged to seek surveillance and follow appropriate treatment."
30488972,"The results of this study suggest that a combination of estrogen-and-rogen therapy can be effective in treating women with hypnotism and improving their quality of life. Estrogen alone is not sufficient to treat these conditions; however, it does provide some protection against breast cell proliferation by increasing the amount of ""non-SHBG bound estrogens"" that are released into the blood. In addition, there is evidence that transdermal patch treatment may improve sexual function in patients with hyporesponsive sexual desires."
32197092,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the efficacy and safety of two different forms of cannanbinol in patients with mild to moderate psychological disturbances. The first is a mixed-effects model that involves both acute and long-term effects of either cannaninoid or morphinergic agents. They conclude that ""high-thc/low-cbd"" products have been shown to be associated with increased risk of mental health."
26915661,This paper presents the results of a literature review on the efficacy of question based interventional measures for depression and anxiety. It discusses the use of smartphone applications to track patients' symptoms and suggests that they may be used as an aid in the treatment of mental illness.
19567343,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrates that the use of either metondazole or nystain in the treatment of relapsed BV leads to different conclusions about efficacy. Both regimens failed to achieve complete cure after 14 days. The results of this study suggest that probiotics can be used as a preventative measure against recurrent vaginal infection. In addition, it has been reported that Lactobaclli can help reduce the severity of post-menstrual uro-thirsty women."
26770296,"In this paper, we describe the results of a randomized, controlled trial of two different capping agents, CaOH and MTA. The results suggest that MTA has a superior effect on cupping than either material."
23997134,"In this first randomized study, we find no evidence of superiority of either type of knee prosthese in terms of pain scores or improvement in functional outcome over two years. We also find no difference in the change scores on the new knee Questionnaire between fixed bearing or ""mobile bearing"" knees. However, patients who receive the fixed bearing tend to have better pain scores and are more likely to improve their condition during the follow-up period than those who get the ""mobaring"" knee."
30003896,This paper focuses on the effects of exercise on adherence to health-related outcomes in middle-aged women. It uses a novel approach to identify the best form of exercise for this population.
31482198,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a large-scale, long-term observational study on patients with Type 2 diabetes. Conclusions that lifestyle changes are associated with reduced risk of developing type 2 and improved survival for patients who adopt healthier lifestyles. Conscious of the importance of improving health in people with Type 2, we conclude that it is important to educate individuals with Type 2-diabetes to adopt healthy lifestyles so as to prevent future complications."
25848343,"The results of this study suggest that both regimens are safe and well tolerated in early breastcancer patients. In particular, the expression of Ki67 and phosphorus is not associated with improved diseasefree or overall survival after adjuvant-chemoprogressive treatment. Conclusions This conclusion suggests that preoperative therapy is a good procedure for patients who have early breast cancer even after 10 years. Both regimens do not result in any significant difference in outcome between men with node positive or node negative breast tumors. However, it does increase BCT rates without significantly increasing LRR. These conclusions suggest that postoperative chemotherapy is an appropriate procedure for those with early breastcarrying. Furthermore, they conclude that high tau protein expression is important in prognosizing benefit from taxanebased therapy. They conclude that long follow-up studies will help to select subtype-specified treatment. For patients with low-risk nodes, FAC-WP improves DFS and overall survival. Ch17cep duplication is the only Biomarker thatdemonstrates significant treatment interaction; however, there is no significant predictive role on p53's status. After 5 years, ECMF is superior to MFF"
21383023,"In this chapter, Conclusions demonstrates that resistance training can be used to increase strength and power in older adults as well as improve physical function. This paper also discusses the use of rapid-repetition force training for improving leg power and performance in older people with compromised health. It is suggested that these studies will help to understand how different exercise regimens can lead to better results."
29955550,"In this paper, the authors present a non-randomized, sfeasibly small sample of patients with schizophrenia who have failed to quit smoking. They conclude that there was no increase in serious neuropsychic adverse events in vareniclines group; however, it is believed that concurrent alcohol and tobacco dependence may present special difficulties to successful treatment. The results indicate that Bup improves smoking cessations compared with pla in nicotine- dependent schizphorenic patients; furthermore, atypical drugs may enhance smoking Cessation outcomes by using bupropion as an antipsychotic. Conclusions This results suggest that one ) smoking reduction rates with the banana patch are modestin schizophrenia; two ) special group therapy for sickly patients is not significant different from American lung association group therapy's effect on smoking ceasesation; and three ) A typical agent may be superior than typical agents in combined with the nicotine Transdermal Patch for smoking cession in schizophrenia. Furthermore, we have shown for first time that ""the use of E-cigarette substantially reduced cigarette consumption"" without causing substantial side effects in long-term chronic schizofienic patients who do not intend to quit. These results"
20097493,"In this study, the effects of a probiotic and prebiotic regimen on gut colonization in preterm premature infants are investigated. The results suggest that early administration of bovine breve into low-birth-women is useful for promoting the growth of the bifdobacterinia while reducing the number of pathogens present at two weeks after birth. Preterm infants receive better colonization with bovine strains than those received with placebo. However, there is no evidence that these strains have any positive effect on feeding tolerance or gut function."
25148386,"In this paper, we present the results of a double-blind, quackery-controlled study on the safety and efficacy of two different drugs for treating hypertension in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Although both drugs are effective at preventing new episode of AF, they do not lead to improved BP control. These results suggest that use of either drug class may be an effective approach to preventing disease in people with type 2 or higher risk of cardiovascular events. This is important because it supports the use of ARBs and/or angiotension blockers in persons with high risk of heart attack."
32145741,"In this chapter, the authors present evidence for the efficacy of tyrannical androgen-replacement therapy in elderly patients with low testosterone. They conclude that it is important to maintain bone mass in older men who have low levels of testosterone because they are at risk of developing Osteoporoseis. Furthermore, their results suggest that testosterone should be used as a preventative measure against excessively high levels of T in these men. However, further studies need to be performed to determine whether or not long-term use of such treatment is safe."
32249071,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the efficacy and safety of a combination of fatty acid, phospholipid, and algal-rich diets for patients with Cystic Fibrosis. They conclude that these studies are not sufficient to advance our knowledge of the disease. However, they do suggest that high-fat, high-alcohol diets can be used as an effective treatment for CF."
17088502,"Short-term treatment of depression with two saline/sertraline analgesion regimens results in improved mood and behavior in patients who respond early to treatment. In contrast, depressed patients who receive placebo show no early improvement in their behavior. Conclusions This is due to the fact that long-term use of these two antipsychotics has been shown to be more effective than short-term administration alone. Although side effects are typical of other uptake-inhibitors, such as imipramine, they are less likely to lead to severe side effects. The only adverse events reported by patients were nausea, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. Both sertraline and escambilopram showed better efficacy in treating major depression. However, there was a significant delay in the start of this study because studies had not yet demonstrated the full effect of these newer drugs."
31464396,"This paper focuses on the association between higher dietary consumption of major sacrificial fats and increased risk of heart disease. It concludes that high-salous fat diets have been shown to be associated with an elevated risk of chest disease. However, it is not yet clear whether this association is due to the use of palmolein as a replacement for other fats or because of its anti-cholestrolemic effects."
24917590,Conclusions and Roussion The results of this study suggest that exercise is an effective strategy for reducing the burden of knee ostearthritis.
22776399,"This paper focuses on the use of activity monitors in older adults to assess physical activity and to predict changes in health. It uses a tri-axial accelerometer as a stand-in-place model, a novel technology that promises to be more accurate than previous methods. The results suggest that the Sensewear Pro2 armb can be used as an accurate measure of exercise expenditure for older adults."
15774495,"Conclusions Digoxin is a risky treatment for patients with mild and moderate heart failure who have not yet recovered from their initial digoxin-inducing regimen. The addition of amalodipine or captopriml to standard therapy does not improve exercise time over a twelve-week period, but there was no increase in adverse events. Captopril has similar long term efficacy as floequinant; however, both drugs are associated with an increased rate of adverse events at the end of the trial. Left ventricular paceing improves quality of life among patients with congestive hearts failure. A randomized placebo-controlled trial confirms the feasibility of one-centre trials in very old heart failure patients without recruitment and retention remaining problematic. It does not show any beneficial effect on exercise tolerance or quality of live in elderly heart fail patients with preserved SYStolic function"
15106221,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the safety and efficacy in a large population of children who were initially deficient in idine. They conclude that an adequate amount of ionized oil can be used as a preventive measure against endemic disease. The results suggest that treatment with iomedinized oil may be more cost effective than other methods for correcting low-to-moderate iodefiency. However, they do not find any significant differences between the effects of either type of treatment."
30368675,"This paper focuses on the association between falls and other risk factors in older adults, particularly those with adversity-disabled conditions. It concludes that cold climates are associated with higher rates of fractures among white women over the age of 65. Furthermore, it is likely that home helpers receive more services during their lifetime than they do when they are older. Further research is needed on the relationship between daylight and fall incidence across different latitude ranges. In this paper, fifty-one different environment hazards were implicated for the occurrence of falls for 58 percent of patients. Thus, preventive measures should not be solely targeted at recurrent or one-time falls. The Chinese elderly have a higher rate of falls than the American elderly. These findings suggest that there may be some ways to prevent falls from occurring in the future."
26841160,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a prospective observational study. We conclude that laparoscopic surgery is more effective in relieving pain than placebo and that it is safe for patients with severe or irreversible endogenosis to undergo this type of surgery. The aim of this study is to compare the efficaciousness of two different treatment regimens: letrozol and norethroisterone  Acetate. Both regimens have a lower risk of side-effects and are associated with improved quality of life after six months of follow-up. Furthermore, both regimens improve sexual desire and satisfaction with health at six months post-surgery. These results suggest that there may be a need for further investigation into the role of pain in women's bowel disease."
31408248,"In this paper, the authors present evidence for the role of brain cues in predicting drug use and behavior. They conclude by examining the association between frequent cannabis use and later-life depression. The results suggest that frequent use may lead to later life depressed states. Further, they suggest that treatment with cannabinol might be more effective than other forms of treatment."
27496935,"This paper discusses the benefits of water-based exercise for improving balance in older women. It demonstrates that it can be used as a preventative measure against falls and also as an aid to improve physical health in older people with a history of fall. The main drawback is that there are no studies on the efficacy of this type of exercise, although several have been published."
26888713,"The results of this study suggest that the Fto allele may lead to higher body weight gain in European children, compared to wild-type subjects. This association is confirmed by the fact that carriers of the ""A"" allele have higher body mass and lower risk of developing overtly overweight or obesity during growth. Furthermore, it is not observed that the common form of the FTo allele increases the success of weight loss intervention. Conclusions In this paper, we provide evidence for the beneficial effects of diet and lifestyle changes on weight loss in patients with the ""FTO"" allel. We conclude that individuals with these genotypes may be better able to lose weight than those without them."
21710185,"In this study, we investigate the efficacy of a mixed-intake approach to treating infants with conlic: exclusion of allergens from the mother's diet is associated with reduction in distressing behavior. The results suggest that a low-allergen diet can be used as a preventative measure against colic. We conclude that there are no significant differences between average daily times spent by the babies in fussing or crying when ingested with fiber-based formula; however, parents choose fiber-containing formula as most advantageous in alleviating their infants' symptoms. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that varied interventionsuch as administration of massimulation, sucrosesolution, herbal tea, and hydrogenlysed formula were effective in the treatment of colic"
15924510,"The results of this study indicate that physiotherapy is an effective treatment for patients with post-acute stroke. In addition, it improves their functional status and quality of life. This paper also discusses the differences between physicians and patients in stroke care. Some patients do not receive adequate medical attention while others benefit from exercise therapy."

25443649,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of exercise to improve function in breastcancer patients. He concludes that it is possible to use exercise as a preventative strategy for improving function in women who have been treated with a high-risk disease. The aim of this paper is to establish whether exercise can be used as an effective treatment for post-treatment fatigue and pain."
30516592,"This paper focuses on the safety of conservative treatment of children with acute or sub-infections. It uses a prospective, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of non-operative treatment for patients with acutely infected abdominal pain. The results suggest that conservative treatment may be more cost effective than surgery in these patients."
26103030,"In this chapter, the authors present a brief overview of the current evidence for cannabines' efficacy in treating multiple scleroid pain. They conclude that it is possible to use cannanbinol as an antiemetic in patients who have not responded to strong opioids or other drugs. Although there are some side effects, these include dizziness, dry mouth, and posture hypotension. This paper also discusses the use of cannaninoid-based treatments in patients with chronic painful conditions. It suggests that canninol may be more effective at relieving pain than any other treatment. A long-term placebo-controlled study is needed to determine whether cannanybinoids might have a greater role beyond symptoms improvement in MS. Cannabinolids were found to be better tolerated when combined with conventional antiempetic therapy. The main aim of the study was to demonstrate superiority of CBME over placebo in improving muscle stiffness among patients with treated spasticity but no significant adverse events occurred. Further studies are needed to confirm the safety of both regimens."
31833645,"This paper focuses on the relationship between physical activity and body composition in young children. It uses a mixed-effects meta-analysis to identify the most important predictors of physical activity for children under age 5. The strongest predictor is personal, while the weakest predicts an environment-level influence. Although previous studies have suggested that physical activity can be used as a predictor of health, this study has not yet been performed."
29178962,This paper presents the results of a prospective observational study using the Body-Quet-Impl-Lite scale as a measure of body mass index in overweight patients. The results suggest that the IwqOL-lite instrument may be useful for assessing changes in quality of life after weight loss and/or body contouring.
29635250,"The results of this study suggest that there is no association between baseline paternal ailment and Fto risk genotype, but that personalization may have an effect on behavior change. Further studies are needed to confirm whether sharing test results with physicians can lead to longer-term changes in health behavior. A third of the DTC Genomic test participants shared their results during an approximate one year follow up period, and this share was associated with high completion of the test. In addition, patients who received genetic information were less likely to quit smoking than those who did not receive it. This suggests that further studies need to be carried out to determine how effective these tests are in changing lifestyle habits."
26053004,"In this paper, the authors present evidence for the use of telemedicine to improve patient adherence to treatment for Type 2 diabetes. They conclude that an ""empowerment-based"" telepathy intervention is highly effective in improving both patient and physician outcomes. A pilot study shows that a short telephone intervention can be used as a preventative measure against type 2 disease. The results suggest that such an intervention may be more cost effective than other forms of self-management support. This paper also discusses some of the latest developments in the field of medical practice. For example, a brief telephone intervention has been shown to improve blood sugar adherence among patients with poorly controlled Type 2 who are not well attended by their primary care physicians."
31399113,"In this study, we examine the frequency and frequency of whitespot lesion in patients who were treated with a lingual bracket. The results indicate that there is no significant difference in the frequency of these lesions when compared to other treatment regimens. Furthermore, it is concluded that lingual appliances can be used as a preventive measure against caries lesions."
26724178,"The results of this study suggest that blood pressure reductions may be harmful for elderly patients. Specifically, the authors conclude that treatment with an antihysteric agent such as esstaan or c and diuretic can reduce blood pressure by as much as three-quarters in older patients without significant adverse events. This conclusion emphasizes the need for more blood pressure-reducing strategies to prevent major cardiovascular events from occurring in elderly patients who have very high blood pressure. In particular, the results of homed-blood pressure therapy indicate that a target blood pressure of at least 131.6mm Hg is sufficient to prevent fatal and minor strokes. Conclusions furthermore support the use of angiotensol-converting enzyme blocker in combination with enzymatic agents in patients with Type 2 diabetes."
15078851,"In this study, Hamilton et al concludes that there is no advantage in 12 over six cycle of CMF-chemopacine in women with localized breastcancer. However, it does show that the addition of a single dose of tanoxifen reduces the number of distant recurrals and improves survival for patients with multiple nodes. The role of post mastectomy therapy in the treatment of operablely advanced breast cancer is further discussed. Although some evidence supports the use of short-term tamifen as an anti-radiation inducer, others suggest that it may be more effective to treat the entire body rather than just one part at a time."
21154392,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of a large, well-respected trial of low dose rispirone for the treatment of patients with panic disorder. We conclude that it is safe and efficacious to use low-dose seropredone as an antipsychotic in patients with severe anxiety. Aripiprasole seems to be an effective addition to the treatment regimen for individuals on stricken or depressed psychiacies. However, more rigorous double blinded studies are needed to confirm these effects."
27325129,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the relationship between endogenous concentrations of testosterone and mortality in men. He concludes that low levels of testosterone may be useful as a predictor of a person's risk of heart attack because they are related to both physical and psychiatric disease. Although there is no significant association between age, smoking, or other lifestyle factors, ""apparent good health"" does not increase the risk of falling from high blood levels to low levels."
28639965,"Selenium is a promising new antithyroid drug in Graves' disease, but there are still some questions about its efficacy. For example, the results of a large-scale selenium trial suggest that it can be used as an early intervention for patients with newly-formed autoimmune thyroidism. In this study, we find no evidence for improving quality of life after 12 months of Seme treatment. However, we do find some evidence for improved absorption of TPO by women with pre-existing autoimmune diseases."
27609849,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the psychological impact of motor vehicle crash-related injuries. It uses a case-control study to examine the association between whiplash injury and poor mental health in patients with traumatic brain injury. The results suggest that there is a significant minority experience associated with psychological distress after TBI, but it does not change for 6 months. In contrast, the integrated outpatient service provided through the Birp provides an effective rehabilitation program for people with moderate to severe TBI even though they live in rural areas. Conscious of the fact that these studies do not support access to compensation, further research needs to be conducted."
30544134,"Conclusions This paper presents the results of a randomized, double-blind, and post-assessment study of the use of force sensing in atrial fibrillation to improve ablation time and reduce the risk of acute recurralence. The results suggest that using a guided catheter with a constant-force sensing technology may be more cost effective than conventional methods for achieving long-term success."
31571503,"This paper presents the results of a pilot study in which we examine the reliability and validity of two balance-testing instruments, the Touch Gauge and the Dgi, used as predictors of fall risk for people with Parkinson's disease. We conclude that the use of these instruments can help to predict changes in gait behavior in people with parakinsonism because they are easily able to be used as stand-in-waiting tools."
30443720,"In this paper, we summarize the most recent scientific developments in the field of obesity surgery. We present a detailed overview of the current evidence for the use of weight loss as a strategy for preventing and reducing the risk of developing Type 2 and Type 3 disease."
24500194,"The purpose of this paper is to determine whether the association among funding and conclusions reflected treatment effects or negative events in randomized trial. A total of 370 random drug trials were included in an observational study, including 25 studies that at least one reported adequate and one reported inadequate amount of concealment. In each meta-analysis, the primary outcome was determined by logistic regression analysis with adjusted for treatment effect, adverse events, and additional cofounding factors. Trials funded by for profit organizations were more likely to report favorable results than trials funded by non-profit organizations. Conclusions This 4-year CombAT study provides further evidence for the long term use of Dutastesteride as a treatment for symptomatic basal thromboph in patients with moderate to severely enlarged prostatic lesions."
17414146,"Iron-deficient infants were divided into two groups: those with high iron levels and those with low iron levels. The first group received a daily iron regimen, while the second group received only a weekly regimen. In this study, we found no differences in birth histories, socioeconomic status, or general nutrition that might otherwise explain lower development test scores for the anemia-depleted children. This suggests that iron is probably not as effective as vitamin A in combating diseases such as malaria. However, when blood tests are entered as covariate, iron-reduced anemic patients treated with iron obtain significantly higher delta Achievement Scores. Conclusions There was no significant difference in height gain over 16 weeks of iron treatment; however, these results suggest that it may be more effective to improve iron status than to increase height gain. Children who have severe anemia should be immediately transfused before they receive iron."
32240516,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights et al.1results in the use of low-dose cannabbinol to treat patients with severe anorezia and chronic hepardia. He concludes by stating that it is not possible to provide effective treatment for such a disorder because of its high mortality and lack of efficacy."
20429925,"Conclusions H/A, N/S M.S and M.D are common among computer workers. More than fifty % of these workers report their symptoms during the first one year after starting new work. The Polish team records higher flexion in the upper arm as a result of pain at follow up parallel to an increase in pain in the lower part of body. After the intervention, shows mainly improvements in chair comfort, lighting conditions, visual strain, and sitting position. However, financial limitations do not permit satisfactory completion of this intervention leading to mixed interpretations of the results"
30031025,"This paper focuses on the effects of short-term treatment of depressed patients, using rtms to track changes in emotional and mental health. It concludes that long-term use of analgesics can lead to rapid changes in brain chemicals involved in emotion and mood. In addition, it suggests that early treatments may be more successful in treating depression than later treatments."
31013312,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of a recent study on curcumins in type 2diabetes and their potential for improving blood-glucose levels in patients with Type 2D. We conclude that curcumns can be used as an effective treatment for both short-term and long-term treatment of these patients."
25887465,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of adjustment for prognostics in randomized trials and concludes that six months' reduction in disability is associated with reduced pain intensity. Six months' decrease in pain intensity is associated by reduction in fear-avoidance behavior and pain catatstrophizing; further studies are needed to determine whether antihypervalgesic drugs can be used in patients at risk for persistent back pain. This paper also discusses the use of preggeralin as an alternative to morphine in treating post-tortomy pain. Although it does not improve pain scores or consumption during the first two weeks after surgery, it does lead to improvements in functional outcomes. The authors conclude that controlling low back pain may have a beneficial effect on patients' belief and clinical outcome. They conclude that controlled lumbar Nez is a particular form of exercise/daily self care with potential for prevent recurrent Nonspecific Low Back Pain and disability among Middle Aged Working Men."
27820060,"In this chapter, Anderson focuses on the use of evidence-based approaches to improve patients' health. He uses a case management system to track changes in patients who are at risk for developing a serious heart disease. He discusses the benefits and drawbacks of using a narrative approach to review scientific evidence."
25979719,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the relative risk of each event in a patient's treatment plan to determine how many patients are needed to prevent a particular event. For example, if one patient experiences a significant pain reduction after a 10 Hz rtms session, then another patient suffers from a similar pain condition for about eight days. This is important because it shows that there is a strong association between motor cortex disenhibition and central pain. Anderson concludes by arguing that use of astandardized outcome across all pain trials would greatly increase the comparability, validity, and clinical application of these studies"
11034690,Carnitine is not a good lipid replacement for premature infants because of its high glycerol content.
18347346,"The aims of this study are to determine the effect of growth-hormone therapy on body composition, strength, and basal metabolism in healthy young adults. In addition, we seek to examine the evidence for the beneficial effects of short-term use of GH on athletic performance."
29490085,"In this paper, the authors describe a six-month treatment of type 2 patients in the United Arab Emirates. They conclude that paricalcitriol does not improve their blood sugar or lipids and do not affect any of the other symptoms of Type 2 diabetes. A single daily dose of 500 IU of vitamin D fortified Yonville yogurt improved all of the following symptoms: glyceremia, hba1c, oesther inflammation, bone turnover markers, and sensitivity to glucose. The results suggest that long-term exposure to high-dose Vitamin D might be beneficial in terms of increasing 25-OHD levels but are not sufficient to reduce the risk of developing Type 2 disease. Furthermore, there is no significant improvement in both endotolhelial function and vasculosity in patients with Type 2 diseases."
21412147,"In this paper, we present the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study of wound infection in patients undergoing open-heart surgery. We find that single-dose prophylaxes are as effective as multiple-dose regimens of Cefaxone and demonstrate that it is even more effective in preventing local and remote wound infections than other antibiotics."
16856043,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a large-scale prospective observational study in which patients were randomly assigned to two different treatment regimens. The first was an antipsychotic and the second was a mood-stabilizing drug. Both groups showed significant improvement in their efficacy over the course of the study. This is due to the fact that both drugs have similar side effects. For example, one patient's blood levels are higher than the other's; therefore, it may be useful to identify patients who aren't responding because of low doses. Furthermore, these patients can be used as predictors of whether they will respond to either treatment."
25829028,"In this double blinded, randomized trial extended-reuse venlafine 150mg/day founds to be efficacious in treating chronic migraine. Although there were some side effects, the study was well tolerated and should be repeated. The authors conclude that it is recommended that venlfaxine be considered as a treatment for patients suffering from transformed migraine due to the high frequency of associated mood disorders."
29510813,"This paper describes a novel, low-cost, and evidence-based approach to treating bipolar disorder in the form of an ""electrified"" web-based psychoeducation package. Its primary end point is that it can be used as a stand-alone intervention for patients who are experiencing severe mental health problems."
30231505,"In this paper, we report the results of a ten-year-old naive child's trial of using Lactobacilus GG as a preventive measure against apprehension. The results suggest that for high-risk children, early Lignobacillus treatment for the first six months of life doesn't seem to prevent the further development of ear and skin prick tests at two years of age; however, it does seem to reduce the frequency of occurrence of these symptoms in older children. Furthermore, infants with elevated cord blood levels were more likely to develop acoustic eczma than those with low cord blood concentrations. This suggests that probiotics can be used as an effective strategy for preventing adolescence and other childhood illnesses."
31494864,"This paper concludes that worksite exercise is safe and effective for improving physical health in the long term. It also suggests that there may be some drawbacks to this type of exercise program, since it does not involve a fixed amount of time or reinforcement. However, studies have shown that short-term exercises are more effective than long-term ones."
29372708,"In this paper, the authors present a meta-analysis of the efficacy of two different types of sealants in terms of their ability to prevent and arrest caries. They conclude that they have found no significant difference in the rate at which teeth are sealed after 12 months compared to conventional sealants. However, there is some evidence that fluoride can be used as an effective anti-caries treatment. These results suggest that flowable polymer composites may be more effective than conventional fillers for inhibiting fissure lesions."
27116227,"The results of this study suggest that a low-serum 25-hydroxyvinculosis level is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This association may be important in understanding how to prevent or delay the development of Type 2 and other blood-related diseases. In addition, there are no significant differences in the severity of disease in patients with low levels of 25-Hyd. A po-doe combination of 1,200 iu/day of vitamin D and 12 weeks of resistance training does not lead to changes in body fat or vascinal fat. However, it does lead to improvements in exercise-induced markers of inflammation. For example, one year of high-dose vitamin D did not increase serum IL-16 levels; however, for three months, both groups had significant reductions in TNF alpha and no. These results suggest that higher levels of VD might help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease."
30338526,"In this study, we examine the effect of a strict diet on infants with cow's milk sensitization at age 6 months. We find that exclusive breast-fed children have a lower risk of developing asthma than those who are exclusively breastfed. However, we also find that there is a reduction in the frequency of wheezeing among high-risk babies when they are exclusively fed. This suggests that public health intervention may be needed to reduce the burden of childhood asthma and its related traits. The first trial for Type 1 diabetes was performed by Dr. Barlow and his colleagues from Australia. They found no association between smoking during pregnancy, abdominal pain, and migraine. Atopy or active cigarette smoke were major influences on wheezers during adulthood; it was strongly related to hay fever/eczemea. Babies with a strong family history of dairy allergy were more likely to develop atopic skin disease because of their positive family history. These findings support the use of an extended hypoallergenic water formula to prevent asthma but not for allergic disease. All these results suggest that exclusive feeding of either type of water formula has a beneficial effect on the prevention of asthma even though it does not reduce"
12962544,"In this paper, we present the results of a six-month, double-blind, i.e. random-controlled study of patients with duchenne dystrophy. We find no significant side effects to be observed in this study, but there are some minor weight gain and mild side effects. Furthermore, these results suggest that long-term treatment with prednizone may be more effective than daily therapy in improving strength in Duchenne's disease."
28410504,"This paper focuses on the effects of exercise training on older adults. It shows that there is a significant reduction in the contribution of no and PG during exercise in older adults, but it does not seem to be related to the role of these two chemicals in preventing age-induced hyperaemia. Furthermore, this study suggests that exercise training can have a beneficial effect on patients with paternal atheism."
29990473,"In this paper, we summarize the results of our previous studies on alpha lipoic acid and its effect on weight loss in patients with Type 2 diabetes. We conclude that ALA is superior to other anti-diabetic agents such as metformin and rosigltazone because it has a lower molecular burden than either of these two classes of drugs. This study will be useful for future patient selection in trials with Alaudca."
24370176,"This paper focuses on the differences between preterm and term infants. Preterm infants are more likely to have physical and mental health problems than their preterm counterparts, but this does not necessarily mean that they will develop these problems later in life."
26061331,"This paper focuses on the use of iron as an alternative treatment for patients with idia. It discusses the pros and cons of various forms of iron therapy, including IV iron sucrose, FCM, and EPO. The main drawbacks to these regimens are that they are not nearly as effective in treating IBD-related anemia as they are in other types of disease. Iron dextran has also been shown to be less efficacious in terms of improving blood levels in both acute and sub-injured patients."
29306984,"In this paper, the authors present evidence for the use of exercise as a preventative measure against falls and fracture in older adults. They conclude that strength training can be more effective than power training for reducing fall risk in older women with bone loss. However, they need to conduct more large-scale studies to confirm this efficacy. The LiFE program is an effective fall avoidance program that improves balance, function, and quality of life among older people with osteoporesis. It also reduces the risk of falling by improving dynamic balance between the two groups. These results suggest that ""home-based training"" is more successful than strength training because there are no significant differences between group groups on other measures of health."
15789890,"Conclusions This paper provides further evidence for the use of the Hamilton-Question-Aims as a measure of changes in patients' health status. The results suggest that change scores can be used to assess patient's own degree of improvement in pain and other musculoskeletal conditions. A simpler, more easily-used version of the instrument is also presented."
21154394,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a previous study. We conclude that adding an adjunctive drug to short-term sri therapy is not as effective as placebo augmentation in patients with severe OCD. Conclusions This work does not yet support the long term effectiveness of these atypical drugs for treatment-responsive OCD; it emphasizes the limitations of current pharmacolatory options in treatment regimens and their chronically use raises safety concerns."
31745834,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of a large, prospective, and observational study of patients with acute atrial fiilation. We conclude that there is no evidence that aspirin protects against decline in mental health when compared to rate-control or rhythm control strategies. However, we do find some evidence that an anticoagulation regimen may be more effective in preventing heart failure than it is in controlling the severity of the disease. Furthermore, these results suggest that maintaining a normal pace in patients with persistent atrial Fiilation may improve their quality of life."
31766052,"In this paper, the results of a large breastcancer trial are summarized. The results suggest that double-reading of 2D+ 3D significantly improved the detection rate in Mammography-separation. However, there is no significant change in the rate and size of interval lesions or grades of interval tumors. Conclusive evidence suggests that one-seeming double-doctor mammography could be used as a stand-alone approach to breastcan detection. Although it does not reduce the risk of death from all causes for breastcancy, the use of combined two-dimentrality and three-dometralities appears to have some advantage over conventional methods."
20655610,"In this paper, Anderson outlines the evidence for a lifestyle intervention to prevent Type 2 diabetes in low- and middle-class subjects. He concludes by stating that it is possible to use an editable version of the Diabetes Preparation Workbook as a guide to implement a high-risk lifestyle intervention. The results suggest that this type of intervention can be successfully implemented in primary health care settings."
28178949,"In this single-blind, sfeasily-controlled study, we find no evidence of significant differences in the tolerability and safety of quetiamine XR or esciplopram in the treatment for major depression. However, patients taking fluoxetine show significant improvements on the Hamilton Depression Rating scale at endpoint. The only side effects reported are nausea and vomiting. Conclusions These results suggest that combined brain-physiological and psychological assessment of prospective subjects may be useful when identifying patients who will respond to placebo."
27027426,"In this paper, we report the results of a large-scale prospective observational study on the association between low urine excretion of potassium and hypertension. This suggests that dietary strategies may be effective in preventing or reducing the risk of developing excessively systolic blood pressure."
24082796,"Conclusions This paper supports the added benefit of BT on top of medicine for children with ADHD, but does not support long-term mental health or social skills training. Children with moderate to severe symptoms continue to exhibit significant behavior problems at follow up and are more likely to receive inpatient treatment than subjects who have low initial scores on the Parents Conners conduct problems scale. In contrast, children with mild to moderately severe symptoms do not develop antisocial or drug abuse disorders after two years of treatment. Although this study provides partial support for ""counseling-based academic intervention in boosting educational functioning in kids with ADHD,"" it does not provide sufficient evidence for an individualized approach to treating these children."
27153869,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the role of physical activity in preventing and reducing the risk of developing Type 1 and Type 2 dementia. Although there is some evidence that physical activity can play a role in reducing these risk factors, it is not yet clear whether exercise will be able to prevent or reduce these riskfactors."
29728079,"This paper focuses on the association between tooth loss and body mass in older adults. The results suggest that older people with more than twenty teeth have greater odds of having a normal body mass index, which is an important risk factor for being overweight. Furthermore, chewing gum does not improve blood sugar or fat concentration in patients with poorer oral health."
24876777,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a large-scale study in China. We find that olazapine is superior to other antipsychotic agents in improving quality of life for early-stage patients with schizophrenia. However, there are significant differences between the results and prevalence, disability, and treatment rates used in the analyze of low- income and middle- income countries; these differences may lead to need for more detailed country-specific analysis before they scale Up mental health services"
17943911,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effect of probiotic treatment on infants' intestinal barrier function. They conclude that prebiotics may be useful in treating atopic and food allergy-prone children. The results indicate that probiotic Lactobacilus GG improves colic symptoms in breast fed infants within one week of treatment. Furthermore, they report that feeding infants with GOS/Fos formula reduces the frequency of antibiotic consumption. This study suggests that using probiotics can help to prevent adolescence by altering the content of the gut microbeta. It is suggested that these effects may lead to protection from allergic disease during early childhood."
21920661,"The results of this study suggest that Cysta-X is more effective in reducing the pain and severity of patients with ""interstitial"" cystitis than PPS. A positive correlation between symptoms and response to treatment are important considerations in managing patients with such a disease. Conclusions Intravesical TTic is safe, effective, and durable in treating painful bladder/symptomis. In addition, it has been reported that BTx-A may have an antinocicitic effect on bladder wall tissue. This suggests that interstitial therapy may be useful for relieving pain caused by other forms of inflammation. Prostagl and misopropstol appear to be particularly effective in treating both acute and long-term effects of these drugs. These studies will help determine whether or not l'arginine can be used as a preventative measure against further complications."
31405892,"Conclusions and Reneval The results of this study suggest that a daily dose of 1,000 IU of vitamin D does not prevent fractures in older people with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, the use of 1,25-OHD3 as a treatment for hip fractures is associated with reduced bone mineral denities in patients with severe deficiencies. This conclusion supports further evidence that high-dose IVD may be more effective than regular IVD in improving bone mineral density among elderly patients with mild to moderate heart failure. Conscious of the importance of maintaining adequate levels of 25-Hydrovitamin D, we conclude that daily or weekly IVD regimens are not sufficient to reduce fractures among older adults living in an institution. In addition, there is no significant increase in risk of falls among older women taking higher doses of 800 IU per day. However, it is clear that these men have greater risk of falling than those taking low doses."
29626044,"In this study, Wuthering Heights et al.1results strongly suggest that anemia and elevated stfr status can impair aerobic adaptation in women with low iron status. Iron-deficient females are better able to tolerate moderate exercise than those with high levels of ferritin. The use of iron in these women is associated with improvement in both body fatness and muscle strength. Intravenous administration of iron improves fatigue in iron deficient women with good safety but tolerability profiles. Ferritin concentration below 15 ng.g./mL leads to significant improvements in fatigue and physical performance in patients with low blood values. This suggests that iron treatment may be more effective in treating iron-detained women with lower blood levels."
24367612,"This paper focuses on the association between age 1 month and longer length of surgery with hospitalized surgical site infection in children. In addition, it suggests that older people are at greater risk of developing these complications than younger patients. The study concludes by identifying several predictors for syphilis in older people as well as other factors that may be associated with this disease. For example, smoking is more likely to increase the risk of an infection than any other risk factor. Although many studies have examined the relationship between risk factors for infectious disease in patients following cathobarbital surgery, this study has been limited because of difficulties in collecting and interpreting the results."
26629535,"Conclusions In this paper, we describe the efficacy of monotherapy in treating bipolar I patients with mild to moderate depression. Bipolar II patients spend more time ill and are less likely to have anxiety disorders. Consciousness suggests that anxiety may play a role in their worsening bipolar behavior. Acute treatment for bipolar disorder is associated with increased risk of suicide attempts."
25644019,"The safety and efficacy of iron-surose in the treatment of patients with nephropathy suggest that it may not be necessary to prescribe iron for all anaemiamic patients. In contrast, Hippo appears to have no significant effect on maintaining haemogenin levels in NDCKD patients. Furthermore, there is no difference in the severity of adverse events over six months after IV iron therapy. Conclusions IV iron administration uses 1000 milligram iron sucrose as divided doses seems superior to other forms of iron therapy in treating patients with hypochondriac disease. Iron stores are depleted during the initial post-opportunity period; therefore, preoperative iron should be avoided in these patients."
26323052,"This paper discusses the results of a study using the Post-traumatic Stress Checklist as a measure of sensitivity to traumatic events in female veterans. The results suggest that the cut score for the test may not be as sensitive as it was previously believed; however, this finding supports the use of Cut Scores of 45- 50 as an appropriate assessment tool for women with a history of trauma."
24362925,"The results of this study suggest that the combination of Phyd, exercise and supervised exercise can lead to significant improvements in pain, sleep, fatigue, tender points count, fitness, depression, and quality-of-life in patients with Fibromya. This paper concludes that there is no significant difference in pain after treatment; however, it does suggest that Pyd may have improved anxiety and sleep. Conclusions We recommend the Bdi Cognitive, Steerforth, and Mhi-5 scales as useful measures of depression, anxiety, and overall mood in patients who have fm. A six-week self-management based program of swimming exercises and education was found to improve physical function and health status in subjects with Fm. In addition, women with moderately painful symptoms improved most by this treatment."
30622734,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to improving patients' health with a combination of education and home-based exercises. They conclude that exercise is more effective for improving knee pain than physical activity alone because it does not interfere with the patient's immune system. Their results suggest that long-term training may be more effective in treating knee OA than other forms of exercise. A randomised trial shows that an eight-week program of high intensity exercise leads to significant improvements in the functional capacity of female China patients with rejubilant knee arthrosis. The majority of these patients continue to exercise in the following 18 months. This study suggests that ""home-based"" exercise can be used as a treatment for knee ostearthria."
18418399,"The aims of this study are to determine whether or not nidipine is an effective and safe alternative for the management of patients with severe hypertension who do not respond to conventional therapy. In this paper, we discuss the efficacy of each of the following drugs in the control of acute pulsive emergencies: 1) Nifepidine is superior to cappril; 2) Licenidine is preferable when a sudden drop in blood pressure is necessary; and 3) Nicardi pine is more rapid-acting than captopriml. Finally, we conclude that both agents are highly effective in the initial treatment of these patients. Although there are some side effects, it is concluded that they are equally effective in treating such crises."
22232096,"This paper discusses the results of a small-scale weight loss intervention that did not improve psychological well-being in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. However, it does lead to improvements in weight loss for people with both Type 1 and Type 2 who were at high risk of developing either type of disease. It also suggests that community-based approaches may be more cost effective than traditional approaches because they do not involve large upfront costs."
29465026,"In this chapter, we summarize the main conclusions of the present study. Conclusions This study does not offer any support for using sertraline as an effective treatment for mild to moderate major depression. Although careful attention is given to method logical considerations, this study fails to provide consistent support in the use of serotonine to treat patients with moderately severe depressive disorder or alcohol dependence. A greater frequency of response between placebo-treated and drug-free patients may help explain these findings"
29211740,"Conclusions This randomized-controlled trial provides promising evidence for the specificity of joint attention or play intervention for children with an autism spectrum disorder. It does not affect language orglobal ratings of social function and communication, but it does improve short-term social skills in young children who have a higher level of attachment to their parents. Parents perceive significant improvements in their children's language, social interaction, and their self-reported stress levels. In this first randomized control trial, we find that early childhood intervention is more effective than day care alone when compared to longer-term treatment. Children with low-functionality show greater gains in imitation after receiving music therapy than speech training; however, they are also more likely to be improved by shorter-term parent education."
28474733,"Conclusions Bipolar disorder is a disease that affects many age groups, and it is difficult to know which treatment is most effective for each patient. In this chapter, we summarize the results of our previous studies on bipolar disorders in children and adults. We conclude that open label ziprazdone seems to be more effective than other antipsychotic drugs in treating patients with bipolar illness. However, there are still some concerns about its efficacy because of the small size of the sample and the lack of an adequate placebo group."
31616340,Conclusions This paper focuses on the role of weight loss and executive functions in predicting long-term changes in body weight.
26449638,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights systematically reviews the evidence for use of an acoustic tooth-restoration technique in patients with one-sided lesions. He concludes by stating that it is not necessary to repeat all of the previous studies because there are still unanswered gaps in the scientific literature concerning the efficacy and safety of this particular technique."
16530201,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft demonstrates that low-dose fish oil can be used as an effective anti-tuberculosis treatment in patients with mild to moderate heart disease. He concludes by concluding that ""low dose fish oil"" does not have any effect on restenosis and suggests that it is important for women to get adequate amounts of Dha during pregnancy and Lactation. The results of the present study indicate that both Dha and EPA seem to have different effects on blood lipids and lipoproteins in overweight men. They also suggest that they may be useful as an adjunct to antihysteric therapy with beta blockers or diurestics."
24585482,"This paper presents the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study in Italy. It shows that gallstone disease is highly prevalent in women and that there is little evidence for its association with heart disease. However, it does suggest that patients should be given adequate information prior to surgery. The authors conclude that this information can be used as a preventative measure against excessive pain during the initial stages of anecdote and pre-operative pain. They conclude that brief relaxation exercises can improve wound healing in patients who are at risk of severe scarlet fever. Furthermore, they demonstrate that using a videotape regarding pediatric anesthesia reduces patient anxiety by reducing the need for written consent."
27765009,"Conclusions Some patients with symptoms of fatigue primarily seek primary care, but there is some evidence that they may be caused by psychological or physical causes. Although the majority of patients do not have a specific cause for their fatigue, it is important to understand how these conditions and symptoms relate to one another."
25003202,"The aim of this study is to determine whether there is any difference in hip scores after one year between total hip arthroplasty vs. resurfacing surgery. A randomization sequence will be prepared and the patients will be asked to perform the surgery according to their preferred technique. After consent, all patients are invited to participate in the study. In the first year follow-up, the mean liner wear rate was reduced by a large 36-mm bone articulation. This results in a significant decrease in the incidence of dislocation at six weeks post-opportunity. However, when compared to conventional polyethylene lines, the metal-on cross-linked Polyethylene liner has a significantly lower risk of fracture than the cementless cemented or cementless prostheses. Conclusions There is no significant difference in quality of life or physical activity between the two types of prosthetics."

18334813,"In this paper, Wu uses a case-control study to examine the efficacy of a new kinematic testing technique in treating patients with food sensitivities. The results show that the application of kensiology can be used to diagnose disease rather than predict its severity."
31118956,"In this paper, Wu uses a case-control study to examine the effects of probiotics on body weight and fat mass in overweight subjects. The results suggest that B420 can be used as an effective treatment for both short-term and long-term hypoglycemic intervention. Wu concludes by stating that ""the efficacy of heat-killing LP28 showed an antiobsity effect; that reduces body fat mass, waist circumference, and food intake."" Furthermore, Wu suggests that consumption of chlorogenic BNR17 could lead to improved absorption of fat from the diet."
25086121,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to determining the best outcome in patients who have undergone a total hip repositioning procedure. They conclude by comparing the results of two different approaches: 1) using patient-specified pin guides to determine the exact location of the prostheses and 2) using conventional instrumentation to restore limb position. The authors conclude that these new developments do not reduce the time or increase the cost of the procedure."
18461255,Conclussion and Discussion This paper focuses on the use of short-term stretching to increase range of motion in patients with hamstring tendon injuries. The authors conclude that this type of stretching can reduce the risk of injury by reducing the severity of the injury.
20921070,"In this paper, the authors present a randomized, doubleblind and placebo-controlled study to evaluate the pain reduction of mepivivacaine in children after outpatient surgery. The patients were divided into two groups: one group was treated with an electrode attached to a scalpel; the other group was given codeine. This study is designed to investigate whether music can reduce pain in children under the influence of professional musicians who attended specific training for medical professions. It shows that both groups have similar pain scores on the Wong Baker Pain Rating scale. Children are less likely to report pain when they see their own pain scores."
22972106,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to blood-glucose control in non-cardiac surgical patients. They describe two groups of patients: 1) patients who have undergone minor surgery and 2) patients who do not undergo major surgery. The first group is composed of patients with no prior history of Type 2 or Type 3 diabetes. The second group is comprised of patients who are either newly resurrected from their previous surgery or have had a long time without improvement in their current condition. Both groups report improved patient outcomes during the post-opportunity period. These results suggest that there may be some value in maintaining blood glucose at a constant level rather than increasing it over time."
11405989,"This paper focuses on the effect of iron treatment on lower mental test scores in infants who are iron deficient. It shows that anemia is associated with poor performance on motor and mental tests, but it does not seem to play any role in the delayed development of these children."
23478741,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the efficacy of exercise-based approaches to prevent and reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute or chronic stroke. He concludes that these approaches are more effective than other approaches because they involve both patient and general care. However, it is important to note that some studies have found no long-term benefits from such approaches. For example, one study suggests that short-term intervention for African American stroke survivors may be an effective way to improve health and prevent future strokes."
22041232,"In this paper, we present the results of a randomized trial comparing the use of multiple-modal approaches to improve patient outcome after elective colonostomies. The results suggest that multimodal intervention can reduce postoperative stays and improve patient satisfaction. Conclusions: Although there is some evidence that pre-operative management of patients with severe bowel dysfunction may result in reduced morbidity, hospital stay, and convalescent time, it is not clear whether these benefits will outweigh the risk of complications."
30886887,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study of low- and middle-class African American women with Type 2 diabetes. We conclude that an intervention led by a community health worker may be more effective than a single physician's intervention in improving blood pressure control among these women. This is important because it will allow physicians to identify people with high blood pressure who are at higher risk for developing Type 2 disease. Furthermore, there is some evidence that using a combination of home-based self-help and group-discipline approaches can lead to improved patient outcomes."
23825185,"The results of this study suggest that a low-sugar diet may be preferable to a high-flora diet in patients with Type 2 diabetes. It is hypothesizes that consumption of very high amounts of sugar can lead to increased blood lipid concentrations, particularly in the hyperintensic group. In addition, it has been suggested that excessive levels of sugar are associated with elevated risk of heart disease. This paper concludes by concluding that ""frucose might be undesirable / particularly for men"" and suggests that glucose as a replacement for sugar should be considered."
31576905,"In this study, we examine the effect of interval and continuous exercise training on systelic cardiac function in patients with mild to moderate obstrumentary pulmonary disease. We conclude that both Ait and MCT are more effective than other forms of exercise training for improving a patient's ability to control his disease. The results of these studies suggest that high- intensity exercise training may be useful as a low-risk part of a treatment program for patients with moderate to severe lung disease."
24516794,"This paper presents the results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind study of the efficacy of single-in--arms-ablation for patients with severe atrial fistias. It concludes that this treatment strategy is safe and effective in relieving symptoms of atrial fibrilation in patients who have persistently recurrent atrial fever."
26497361,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of two recent randomized controlled trials. The first trial showed that statin and fibrate combined reduced the risk of fatal heart attack in patients with low-dental-cholestrol levels. The second trial showed no effect on stroke or total mortality. This study concludes that bezafisbrate is safe and effective for treating patients with high-risk pre-diabetic disease. It also suggests that gemfibrozill may be more effective as a preventative measure against atheroscomatose lesions after bypass surgery."
27317033,"This paper focuses on the safety and efficacy of early laparotomy for patients with mild to moderate acute calculus disease. It is based on a large randomized trial and concludes that it is superior to conservative treatment in terms of mortality and morbidity. Conclusions In high risk patients, percutaneous drainage or delayed interval surgery are both effective in resolution of acutecholeciestitis. However, these two approaches are not always possible due to higher procedure-respective morbidities. Percutaneous draining is still preferable because it allows for improved pre-operative assessment of the gall Bladder and safe interval Laparoscopic surgery"
26824223,"This paper discusses the benefits and drawbacks of a community-based health check program for older adults. The main effect was to promote  diet change and reduce blood pressure. However, there was no significant difference in risk factor levels among those who received the health check. In contrast, the intervention group did not have a significant impact on stroke or major atheothrobitic events. There was little evidence that routine risk assessment could be used as a preventative measure against heart disease."
27600634,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates the efficacy of a new type of knee arthrostry, using a novel combination of machine navigation and artificial knee articulation to achieve superior results. This new approach is more cost-effective than conventional surgical methods because it involves less risk of oversizing and complications in the early stages of the procedure. The authors conclude that ""ICA-tka produces superior clinical outcomes"" compared with ""conventional TKA."""
30519012,"In this paper, the authors present a systematic review of the evidence for use of retropulsion tests in patients with parkinson's disease. They conclude that there is a moderate relationship between the test and body motion during the off phase but no relation during the on phase. Thus, it is not clear whether these results are accurate or not."
28673352,"In this paper, we summarize the results of our previous studies on fish oil and lipids in type 2diabetes. We conclude that fish oil is superior to atorvastain in improving apoB secretory functions in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, we suggest that fish oils may be useful in treating other heptoprotective diseases such as heart disease."
18685403,"This paper discusses the use of the Posterican Questionnaire in a prospective study of patients with advanced lung disease. It is shown that the criterion response, or CRQ, is accurate and responds to both short and long-term breathlessness. Furthermore, it has been found that the six-minute walk can be used as an assessment of efficacy in treating patients who suffer from advanced disease."
31578051,"In this paper, the authors present a novel exercise intervention for patients with acute spondiness. They describe an eight-week program of physical activity and self-relief as well as a six-week follow-up period. Their main conclusions are that exercise is safe and can be used to treat patients suffering from ankyloping spasm."
23848480,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates the efficacy of using lycrasts to improve movement and function in patients with chronic stroke. He demonstrates that bracing can be used as an effective treatment for children who have a severe form of congenital palsy. This paper also discusses the use of otohps, or hand-to-hand therapy, which are used to treat children with brain injury."
20459730,"The results of this study suggest that the combination of pyreomydal decoction and exercise can improve symptoms, sleep, fatigue, tender point counts, fitness, depression, and quality-of-life in patients with fist-masculination. In addition, it suggests that a combination of patient education, exercise, and physical training may be more effective than either treatment alone. A six-week self-management based program of swimming exercises and education could improve the health of patients with Fistmasulic disease. This improvement is sustained over at least six months after the completion of the program."
31461458,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft uses a mixed-effects approach to examine the effects of public health insurance on blood pressure in two different African countries. The first is a case of rural Nigerian hypertensives who suffer from high blood pressure due to poor access to health care. The second is an example of a community-based payment system that improves quality of care for patients and reduces spending on hospital out-of pocket expenditures. Both schemes have little effect on overall health expenditures in Africa."
23473733,"In men, a high-grain diet is associated with reduced risk of Type 2 diabetes. Consuming whole grain foods reduces the risk of developing type 2 disease in men who may be influenced by fiber. The DASH diet has beneficial effects on blood pressure, lipids, and sterols. In patients with Type 2 disease, the Dash diet improves their sensitivity to both insulin and triglycemic changes. In free-living subjects, it increases antioxidant capacity, decreases BP, and improves oesthelial function. This suggests that the DASH can lower blood pressure in these subjects. Women's sex is also associated with an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease. These women are especially likely to have higher levels of consumption of dairy than men."
23935716,"The results of this randomized study do not show any advantage of the ""mobile bearing"" knee prosthese over the fixed bearing design at the 5 year follow-up; however, there are no significant differences in functional outcomes between the two designs. In contrast, the FP platform does not offer any advantages in knee function during the first three months of follow up. At the end of the study, however, it is clear that the MB and FB designs perform better than the other two types of prostheses."
23375241,"In men with significant storage symptoms, a combination therapy with triazosin or extended-release alpha blockers was safe and efficacious than monotherapy. Conclusions The 4-year CombAT results indicate that combination therapy is more effective in treating patients with moderately to severe Luts because of BPH and Prostatic Enlargement. However, the addition of serenoaric repens does not improve Ury Retention. A large-scale randomized placebo-controlled study is needed to further evaluate the long- term safety and effectiveness for this agents in treating Lucits/BPH without ED"
29877887,HeartWare is a promising device for treating patients with heart failure.
30007275,"In this paper, we describe the results of a six-month weight loss program in patients with Type 2 who are not adhered to a strict CRD diet. We find that the LCM diet is more effective than the ADA or TT diet in improving blood lipids and other risk markers for Type 2D and CVD. Both diets have significant effects on both body weight and health but do not lead to significant changes in blood glucose levels. Although both diets increase blood glyceride concentrations, they do not result in significant improvements in overall blood glucose control."
26803696,"In this paper, Holm and nail are used as a second-best option for treating unstable intertrochantesric fractures because they are less traumatic than sliding hip screws. They also show that there is no significant difference in the rate of complications between the two methods. For example, patients who have been treated by residents receive a better result with their Gamma-3 nail than those who have not been trained to use it. Both devices seem to be effective at treating these types of fractures although further studies need to be performed. The results suggest that the sliding hip screw is superior to the sliding nail in terms of time, blood loss, and improvement in patient outcome. A surgical delay greater than twelve hours increases the risk of 30 day mortality and an increased risk of 9ty day mortality when the education levels of the surgeon are below that of attending surgeons. This study suggests that instability may be fixed using locked extramedulatelary small daimeter screw systems or with new Intramullary Systems to avoid potential Mechanical Complications of a broke latéral wall."
25099546,"The results of this study suggest that the consumption of a high fiber diet may lead to a reduction in the risk of hepatosis and other liver diseases. Furthermore, it is not associated with increased risk of mortality from all causes except cardiovascular disease. This conclusion supports the use of metformin as a treatment for patients with alcoholic-fatty liver disease."
24824056,Conclusions The results of this study indicate that the use of an omi with IPS does not result in a significant improvement in canine rotation when compared to other treatments. Concluusions Both methods are effective for treating Class I patients with moderate crowding.
31321227,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of the Touch-and-Gait test in elderly patients to predict future falls. He concludes that all versions of the test are reasonably accurate for predicting future fallers during the six months following the assessment. The Brief-Bestest is particularly useful when it is used to assess risk of falling among older adults because it is sensitive to changes in gait speed. Finally, Anderson suggests that the MEFAP and the TUG are good tests for assessing functional mobility in people with adolescence. Although they do not share the same beneficial properties as the BBT or DGI, they seem to be more sensitive and specific than the other tests. However, their scores are still too high at the individual and group level to be used as reliable predictors of falls."
25353646,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of electrical currents in the treatment of patients with severe acute myosmo-impairment. He concludes that EMS seems to be useful for preventing muscle atrophy and improving functional status in these patients because it affects muscle groups rather than directly affecting them. Conclusions furthermore suggest that mechanical ventilation is more effective in treating patients with moderately ill heart failure than other forms of therapy."
23967064,"In this paper, Dr. Manette argues that there is little evidence for the efficacy of physical activity in preventing and reducing the risk of stroke in men and women. He uses a case-control study to examine the association between duration of walking and hypertension. After controlling for age, body mass, alcohol consumption, smoking status, frequency of moderate leisuretime physical activity, sprystolicblood pressure, diaspilic blood pressure, and rapiding plasma glucose levels, the relative risks for hypertension were reduced in men who walk to work for 21 minutes or less than those who did not. The results suggest that ""walking and cycling as transportation"" may be beneficial for preventing premature death from Type 2 diabetes."
19776505,"In this paper, the results of a single-arm trial are summarized. The first study shows that topical Em dogain will promote increased gain of bone and attachment levels in periodontals compared to conventional surgical procedures. The second study suggests that using e-ptfe as a scaffold for both EMD and GTR can lead to greater gains in terms of pocket depth and defect resolution than either technique alone. Both treatments result in significant reductions in cal and papillary defects over a four-year period. However, both approaches do not improve the patient's long-term health. For example, patients treated with emdogain receive better results at one year after surgery than those treated with flap surgery alone. This is important because it provides an important basis for a large, controlled clinical trial."
12804434,"The narrator discusses the benefits of resistance training for improving leg strength, gait speed, and function among older adults. He concludes that this type of exercise can be used as part of a long-term treatment for elderly patients with knee pain who are not fit to participate in regular physical activity. However, there is no significant difference in falls between the two groups. In contrast, resistance training does not increase muscle strength or size in healthy young people. A program of three or four weekly resistance exercises improves leg power and muscular strength but does not improve functional capacity in older men and women over age 55. This suggests that older adults still have the ability to gain muscle strength by slowing down their muscles. Conclusions Older adults remain fairly resilient after 10 weeks of heart detraining; however, they retain newly gained Muscle Strength for at least five weeks despite an interrupted formal exercise program. Both intervention strategies result in a reduction in acute dialysis decline rates. Elderly patients respond positively to resistance training even though they are frail and do not have mild dementia. They also report improvements in bone mineral content and blood cell count. These results indicate that progressive resistance weight training may produce substantial gains inmuscle strength and inpower"
24212996,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft systematically reviews 100 of the most recent evidence-based medicine studies and concludes that there is sufficient new evidence for at least one outcome within two years. He then uses a survival analysis to determine whether changes in evidence are sufficient to warrant updating an existing systematic review. The results of the study suggest that the use of Gic as a preventive sealant is superior to the retention rate of resin pit or fissure sealedants."
29615407,"In this paper, Caius uses the results of a large European study to suggest that a low fat diet can be used as a preventative measure against excessive weight gain. He concludes by stating that it is unlikely that high-protein or high-fiber pasta produce a better satiating response than either food. The results do not seem to support the notion that high fiber or higher-protein pasta produces greater ""satiety respond"" compared to lower amounts of both nutrient content. This conclusion does not hold true in all three conditions. Consuming a reduced-GI diet leads to significant changes in blood lipid levels and body weight in subjects with Type 2 diabetes. However, there are no significant differences between the two groups. Furthermore, the effect on postprar and Ial glucose or other metabolic parameters did not differ from the two group but was morepronounced within the Glycemic Index group. Conclusions An LGI diet improves fasting pulse pai-1 activity and thus may be useful at diminishing the detrimental cardiovascular effects of overweight"
25532993,This paper focuses on the association between hot flushes and other comorbidities. It concludes that there is a strong association between elevated oestroglin and testosterone levels and increased risk for type 2 diabetes in postmenopauseal women. These results suggest that some role may be played in the development of this disease.
21925051,"Conclusions The results of the J-Rhythm study suggest that rate control and rhythm control are more effective than either strategy in preventing or reducing atrial relapse. However, patients treated with these two drugs have a higher risk of death than those treated with rate control. In patients with acute heart failure, treatment withdronedarone is associated with an early mortality due to worsening left ventricular dysfunction. This suggests that regimented warfarin therapy may not be appropriate for patients with congested heart failure."
27395403,"The purpose of this paper is to review and discuss the mistakes made by physicians who use retrospective chart reviews as a guide for conducting studies in patients. Aiming to further investigate the efficaciousness of amorphine in children and young adults with tic disorder, Conclusions concludes that it appears to be an effective and well-tolerable treatment for these conditions. Although there are some side effects, such as sedation, no significant differences were found between the two groups. In contrast, ziprasidone was the most commonly associated side effect. Conscious of the potential drawbacks of this method, Conclisions recommends that a double blinded placebo-controlled trial of acetylprasole should be performed in order to determine whether its efficacy can be extended into controlled trials."
26883234,"This paper focuses on the effects of post-surgery complications on patients' quality of life. It concludes that laparoscopie, stricturoplasty, and smoking are all risk factors for delayed wound healing. The results suggest that stress may play a key role in these events. In contrast, alcohol consumption, exercise, healthy eating, and sleep are not associated with increased wound healing speeds. These findings provide guidance for research to determine the causes of surgery adverse events and targeted quality improvement measures."
27509867,"Conclusions This paper uses a novel approach to evidence that statins can be used to treat Type I and Type II adiposes, particularly in patients with high blood pressure. The results suggest that the combination of statin treatment and simvastain may be more effective in treating Type I congession than either statin alone."
28601888,This paper uses a mixed-experimental approach to examine the effects of a weight-controllability intervention on children's perceptions of obesity and its negative consequences. It finds that the intervention is effective in reducing excessive weight but does not lead to significant changes in the way children think about it.
32172237,"The results of this study suggest that the use of analcibib to treat patients who have recently had a heart attack may be inconclusive. Although there are no significant differences between the two groups, it is clear that anacetrapub does not lead to a lower risk of sudden death in patients with a history of acute coronary disease. In contrast, treatment with cetopardib reduces LDL-cholesterol levels but does not result in any reduction in the risk of severe cardiovascular events. This conclusion supports the previous point made earlier by Wollstonecraft: ""Hdl-C levels were basically unrelated to Non-Carovascular Disease Mortality."" However, when different methods were eliminated, a consistently inverse relation was apparent between HDL-cholestrate levels and chest disease event rates. Conclusions Acute coronary syndrome patients treated with ananecdote did not have a significantly reduced risk of fatal events compared to those treated with placebo. When blood pressure, creatin kinases, or other abnormalities were removed from the control group, these patients showed marked improvement in their quality of life after 24 weeks of statin treatment."
27037567,"In this paper, the authors present the results of a randomized, feign-blind, single-tongued study of two different types of pulp capping: cement and marble. They conclude that both are effective at cupping primary morals with either cement or marble. Both materials have similar efficacy in preventing tooth decay. However, there is a significant difference in the diameter of the exposure between the two materials when compared to the size of the patient's mouth. Histological findings do not support these conclusions. The use of structured abstracts does not increase the sensitivity, precision, or yield ofretrieved clinical trials from Medline."
19307137,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective observational study on patients with chronic post-toromy pain who received IVCA combined with cryoanalsia. This study concludes that ""very-low dose ketamine"" was not effective in preventing long-term Post-Thoracomy pain. However, it did reduce the frequency of pain at 1st and 3rd days after surgery. Furthermore, these patients had less pain during the first two days than they had after other procedures. The use of epidural blocks prior to surgery is a good strategy for preventing painful complications. Epidural block does not lead to significant changes in pain; however, there are some indications that it may be useful as a predictor of future pain."
23901263,"The results of this study suggest that current use of estrogen may reduce the risk of fractures in older women, and it is recommended that this regimen be continued for at least another ten years. In contrast, treatment with cees-misoprotine has no significant effect on symptoms or quality of life over one year. Although there are some side-effects, these include headache, infection, back pain, and hot flushing. Conclusions conclude that BZA/ce can be used to treat menopaausal symptoms as well as to prevent bone loss."
20927753,"The results of this study suggest that the consumption of breastfed infants with low blood concentrations of vitamin D may be a cause for low maternal milk supply. Conclusions, however, suggest that women with low bone mineral content should be given more orally-administered vitamin D. Body mass and sports activity are stronger predictors of bone mineral status in girls than in men. In addition, ethnicity and season play a major role in serum 25H dithiopatra D. This paper discusses the importance of having adequate levels of these two important nutrients in children. It is necessary to know how best to provide adequate amounts of these essential nutrients in order to prevent disease from occurring."
31521556,"In this paper, Dr. Manette focuses on the use of motor imagery to improve physical function in older adults who have a stroke. It is shown that using motor imagery during physical therapy can improve postural stability, timed up and go, gait test, and leg strength. The results suggest that older adults may be able to take benefit from these exercises as a ""cost-effective"" and practical way to improve their postural control, mobility, and performance. This paper also discusses the issue of quality assessment with a tool called the PEDro Score."
28700715,"Conclusions In this paper, we present the results of a two-year follow-up study on children with recurrent ADHD. The main conclusion is that Methhylphini date and Clonidine are safe and efficacious for treating these children. However, there are some drawbacks in the trial: it was not designed to be used as a stand-alone treatment; instead, it was used as an intervention in combination with behavior therapy. This does not lead to improvements in quality of care provided by community-based practices. Furthermore, no evidence exists for the additive effects of multimodulant treatment next to titrated methylphoni date."
28869278,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of a recent study on infants with severe preterm birth. The aim of this study is to determine whether or not early-morbid cerebral oxygenation can be improved by using near infrayal spectroscopies as a means of predicting neuropsychiac changes. This work has been published in several peer-reviewed journals and it is therefore necessary for further studies to be performed."
22665997,"In this paper, we summarize the results of two recent randomized controlled trials in which paroxetine was shown to be more effective than fluoxamine in treating social anxiety. Conclusions Paroxeine is an effective short-term therapy for generalized social fear disorder. Short term treatment does not lead to any further advantage; however, it does lead to significant improvements in symptoms and severity after 12 weeks. Although all active treatments are superior to peggottin on primary outcome measures, combined treatment did not result in any further advantages. However, exposure therapy alone showed improvement during follow up, while sertraline or serotonephrine alone showed tendency towards degradation after completion of treatment"
25100025,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the failures of various types of tooth-restoration materials. He concludes by describing the reasons for failure: fracture of restoration; secondary caries; loss of pulpal contact; and loss of inlay. The results of the present study indicate that the most significant risk of having a pulpal infection is the presence of ""radiographic evidence of rootfillings."" However, there are other risk factors involved in the patient's health, such as gender and parafunctory habits. Finally, Anderson discusses the use of composite resin to protect teeth from endodontic intervention."
28275869,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to identifying patients at risk for heart disease by comparing their lipid levels with those of healthy adults. They conclude that consumption of flax-seed oil or other fatty acids can be used as a preventive measure against cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, they suggest that moderate amounts of alka-alcohol or flaxseeed oil can reduce inflammation and improve blood concentration of certain inflammatory markers in high-risk patients."
28912917,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a large-scale, long-term observational study on patients with tidbits of disease. We conclude that BNP levels should be considered as a good predictor of LVD in Pio-treated patients because it is suggested that pio treatment leads to metabolic improvement and histology improvements in subjects with no alcoholism. Conclusions This was a very well-respected proof of concept for treating patients with T1DM. It also showed that there were significant differences between the two groups in terms of their effects on lipids. Both groups improved significantly from baseline."
31452084,"In this paper, the authors present a set of conclusions and draw on several evidences to support the use of a short-term smoking intervention in patients with serious heart disease. They conclude that it is cost-effective for physicians to deliver a brief education and follow-up program to patients who have not yet quit smoking. They suggest that further studies should be performed to determine whether such a program is more cost effective than other forms of treatment."
28720391,"Conclusions This paper summarizes the results of a recent study on patients with advanced papillary rheumalogous cell carcinomas. It showed that foretinimb, a potent anti-cancer drug, was well tolerated in these patients and demonstrated a good response rate in those with germline metastatic disease."
16908917,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the relationship between financial incentives for improved health care quality and the use of these incentives to improve physician practice practices. Although there is some evidence that financial incentives can lead to improved patient outcomes, Anderson concludes that it is not possible to predict the long-term effects of such incentives."
24242888,"This paper discusses the long-term effects of a mild brain injury on balance problems. It concludes that balance problems may persist for several years after an injury. ApEn, a device used to track changes in nerve impulses, has shown promise in detecting subtle changes in Postural control. Concussion Using the Besse as a postural stability measure, subjects improved when compared to their individual performance. The use of the two-tongue test and the Stroop task furthermore suggest that these two tasks can be used to predict changes in posture."
28913588,"In this paper, the four drugs are compared in terms of their efficacy and side effects. The first drug, tramadol, is associated with longer time-to-ejaculate times than placebo; the second drug, sildenalfil, induces better satisfaction than other drugs. Conclusions: On-dem and dapaxetine seems to be effective treatment for men who have moderately severe premature ejuculation. Concliusions: Phodiesterase 5-inhibitors seem to be more effective in treating patients with early ejacuation when combined with sertraline. Dissipation delays can be prevented by using topical anecdote only. Sertraline appears to be as effective as any other therapy for pembroke disease."
28660673,"This paper presents the results of a prospective, observational study of patients with shoulder pain who received physiotherapy as part of an outpatient treatment plan. The results suggest that physiotherapist-led therapy may be more cost effective than surgeon-led care in terms of improved patient satisfaction and reduced wait times."
24508930,"This paper discusses the benefits of moderate-load weight exercise for people with a stroke. It concludes that moderate-volume training is safe and feasible, but it does not result in significant improvements in lower-limb strength in patients with stroke. In contrast, progressive resistance training does not lead to greater gains in lower leg strength in adults with down syndrome. A tai chi training program appears to improve balance in mildly to moderaterate Parkinson's disease, with additional beneficial effects on functional capacity and improved falls. Conclusions These results suggest that an eight-week interventionof whole-body vibratory training or resistancetraining can increase muscles strength -- without negative effect upon spasticity -- in adults who have cerebral palsies. There are no significant differences between the two groups; further studies need to be carried out before any further conclusions are made about the use of resistance training in these patients."
26503388,"In this paper, Conclusions discusses the use of risk scores as a tool for identifying patients with high risk for heart attack and stroke. He concludes that it is more appropriate to use risk scores in pre-disciplined settings than to use anecdote-based risk assessment tools such as the Procam risk score. However, these approaches do not improve blood pressure or alter the treatment of patients with hypertension. Furthermore, convalescent patients with Type 2 diabetes who have no history of acute or chronic disease should be included in the progamming Aspects of Stroke in the General population."
24789063,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to stroke prevention: an ""integral system of education"" that involves both patient and general practitioners. They conclude that it will be more effective than usual care in reducing vascular risk for patients with mild-to-medicated strokes. Their results suggest that a simple, brief intervention could be used to improve blood pressure control among stroke survivors. The Nurse-Led Stroke Education program did not have a significant effect on improving adherence to preventive measures; however, there was a small increase in selfefficacy at 12 months after discharge. This suggests that physicians may need to further tailor their approaches to patients with higher risk of developing new vascular diseases. A cluster randomized trial is planned to assess the efficacy of remote technology in the health care setting."
24863864,"Conclusions Depressive patients are associated with worse performance on memory tasks after a series of 8-week treatment. This effect is rapid and stable, but superior to viloxazine and mapsrotiline; it may be due to the lack of an anticholineric action. In addition, convalescent studies have suggested that training can improve depressed patients' performance in certain domains such as executive function. Concluusions These results suggest that treating depression with escorts can lead to improvements in mental functions. Concliusions Although there is no difference between sertraline or norriptyline for the amount of brain changes associated with treatment, stroke patients receive improvement in both verbal and short-term memory functions. The effects of these two treatments are not confirmed by primary outcome measures, but several secondary measures suggest efficacy"
31009401,"In this paper, we present the results of a feces-mibiota transplantation study in patients with naive, nonalcoholic fatty lip disease. The results suggest that probiotics can be used as a novel treatment for this disease."
27501434,"In this paper, the effects of a parent-training intervention on children with conduct disorder are examined. The results suggest that it is possible to improve child behavior by using a combination of preventive measures and evidence-based approaches. For example, parents who attend more than half of their child's training sessions have a significant reduction in child conduct problems when compared to those who do not attend. Conclusions furthermore suggest that treating children with ""common elements"" or other forms of treatment may be an effective strategy for improving child behavior."
21331532,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the false positive results of the ""A-B versus B"" design and discusses its potential for preventing or exacerbateing this problem. It concludes that there are no known side effects of mutilation applied to cephalic breech patients, and that it is safe for both mother and child. Concliusions Aconite cakeseparated moxbustion has beneficial effect on knee osteoarthrits of liver and renal deficiencies type, and the efficacy at ana phase is better than those of Sodium diclofenates slow-released tablet"
29154069,This paper reports on the efficacy of nse in treating patients with Type 2 diabetes. It shows that a single daily dose of Nse can reduce blood pressure and improve body weight in patients with moderate-to-severe Type 2 disease.
21150647,"In this paper, the effects of feeding infants a formula containing either prebiotics or probiotics were investigated. The results showed that infants fed these formulas had less and shorter bouts of diarrhea than those fed control formulas. This was due to the presence of B-lactis, S- thermophilus, and other immune-stimulating compounds in the infant's feces. These compounds also reduced the frequency of outbreaks of infectious diseases during the first six months of life. Thus, it is likely that an immune-modulating effect may be the main mechanism of action for early infection prevention. Long term consumption of breast milk contained commensals bacteria which inhibited Staph aureus but did not lead to increased outpatient mortality. Prebiotic mixtures with galacto/flora improved stool frequency as well as the pH of the gut. There was no change in growth, crying, vomiting, or regurgitation pattern between the two groups. A low amount of GOS could improve stool frequency, decrease Fecal pH, and stimulateintestinal Bifbidobacterium. It was found that Lactobacilus GG seemed to have protective effects against acute diarrhea"
26358067,"This paper focuses on the safety and efficacy of probiotic-fermented infant formulas in comparison to standard infant formulations. It uses a case-control study to examine the effects of different forms of feeding on infant health. In particular, it shows that breastfed infants have higher concentrations of lactic acidogenes than infants who are not breastfed."
28263370,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft discusses the results of a large-scale study in which patients were assigned to either a fixed dose combination pill with aspirin, statin, and/or an antiplatelet regimen. This trial showed that polypill therapy was more effective than monotherapy in reducing blood pressure and total mortality among patients with or without Type 2 diabetes. The main outcome of the study was improvement in adherence to prescribed treatment for blood pressure, cholesterol, and other risk factors over 15 months. Afraid of side effects, patients were not discouraged from taking their prescribed medication. However, there were significant improvements in patient adherence across all predefined sub-groups. There were no major adverse events or complications in the control group but only minor changes in Sbp and LDLcholesterol. These results may have implications for future heart attack and stroke prevention."
31703073,"Conclusions This is the first report of a long-term improvement in social skills among young children with autistic spectrum disorder. The treatment does not affect language orglobal ratings of social function and communication. However, it does lead to improvements in attachment-related behavior and trait anxiety. In addition, the play-based intervention has significant effects on parent-child interactions without increasing parents' stress or depression. Parents who use the Hmtw program are more likely to improve their child's social skills than those who do not use the program. These results support the claim that ""parent-mediated intervention"" can be used as an early intervention for ASD."
16235365,"Estratest androgen therapy are more effective in improving bone mineral density than either of these two treatments alone. In this study, the addition of rogen or estrioles is associated with improved somatic symptoms; however, it does not lead to any significant changes in brain function. This paper concludes that ""monitoring lower Oesphagal contractility"" may be useful in early detection of brain death. It also suggests that transdermal patch treatment can improve sexual function as well as physical health. The results of this study suggest that short-term use of both estrogen and progesterin might be beneficial for women who have been treated with hysterectomism. However, they do not result in improvement in body mass or quality of life."
29178166,"Conclusions The SAF irrigation system is more effective than either needleirrigation or rotary irrigation. However, there are some drawbacks: 1) it does not remove the ""smearlayer"" of the root canal; 2) it only removes the debris layer; and 3) it cannot be used as a stand-in-waiting irrigation device."
30477509,"This paper focuses on the reliability and validity of an accelerometer-assertion program for older adults. It is clear that this system can be used to track changes in physical activity over time, but it does not provide sufficient information to predict long-term health consequences."
17253502,"In this paper, the results of a prospective, fessive single-blind, rat-controlled study are summarized. The main conclusion is that both drugs work well in treating panic disorder in patients who receive appropriate psychological treatment. Although there is some disagreement as to whether imipramine acts as a ""pharmacological block"" for panic attacks, it does not seem to be an effective treatment. Conclusions A number of studies have reported on the efficacy and safety of combined psychotic and antidepressedant treatments for panic disorder."
24282034,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed description of the interaction between methadone and imipramine in a single-blind study. They conclude that both drugs are efficacious in treating patients with depressed moods. Furthermore, their results suggest that they may be useful as short-term treatment for PMD."
29131895,"The results of the Hyvet trial suggest that early treatment with angiotension-converting inhibitors may be more successful in preventing major strokes and fatal events than later treatment with other agents. In patients at moderate risk for heart attack, however, strict control of blood pressure is sufficient to prevent significant adverse events. However, there are some drawbacks: it is not possible to predict whether strict control will result in reductions in major events or death from all causes. For example, treating a patient with a blood pressure of only 105mm Hg as low as 160mmHg leads to a modest reduction in both major and minor cardiovascular events. Furthermore, this regimen does not lead to any improvement in renal function over time. Finally, these conclusions support the recommendation of the Fifth Joint National Committee regarding treatment options for people with mild hypertension."
31680952,"In this chapter, the authors describe the results of a single-blind, cross-sectional study in which a camprosate was found to be ineffective at reducing alcohol drinking in a particular sample of patients. This may be due to the lack of social support and other factors that might contribute to this negative result. The conclusion is that nalltrexone does not seem to be efficacious as a treatment for alcoholism; however, it has important implications for future efforts to develop new drugs to treat these patients. Acamproseate appears to be more effective than either placebo or with medical management in improving alcohol consumption. Morphine seems to reduce sleep duration by reducing rapid eye movement and increasing corroborated blood pressure. These findings suggest that use of targeted approaches to medication treatment could improve important health disparages related to alcohol abuse."
24488616,"Losartan is a safe and effective treatment for children with moderate-to-severe hypertension. In addition, it has been reported that it can be used as a preventative measure against major events in the future. Children with moderate to severe hypertension are particularly at risk of stroke, heart attack, and kidney failure."
30698254,"In this paper, we use a cross-sectional approach to examine the relationship between frailtiness and other risk factors in older adults. We find that frailties are more frequently associated with developing non-adventure than with all causes of dementia. This is due to the fact that people who have been frail for an extended period of time tend to have higher risk of dying than those who do not have any such condition."
20100340,"Iron status is associated with poorer learning and memory performance in African women of maternal age. This study suggests that iron-deficiency anemics may have a stronger relationship with depression, stress, and other mental health problems than they do with infants. In this paper, we examine the effect of iron on children's growth and development during the first three months of their pregnancies. We conclude that daily iron supplementation will be sufficient to improve brain function in these patients."
21735443,"This paper discusses the use of financial incentives to improve physician behavior and patient outcomes. It focuses on two main issues: 1) physicians are not motivated by financial incentives; and 2) there is a lack of understanding of how these incentives work. The first problem is that physicians do not receive enough incentive to change their practice practices. The second problem is with the fact that fundholders tend to be more likely to see patients sooner than controls. Physicians who receive financial incentives have a better chance of seeing more patients, particularly when the hospital offers special services for fundholder-only patients. Finally, the results show that payment increases primary care visits but does not lead to improved immunation rates among the elderly."
18201645,"Conclusions In patients with moderate to mild alcohol dependence, ""met"" is more effective than a feedback or education session alone. There were significant sub-group differences by stage of starting binge drinking behavior, for frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption; there was no evidence for treatment effect. The results indicate that brief advice can motivate patient's to reduce their liquor consumption. This study further supports the use of communication as a method of preventing excessive drinking in general practice."
28978497,"This paper presents the results of a large, cross-sectional study of adults with and without children who had been followed for five years. The authors conclude that children with moderate to severe ADHD have a higher risk of developing an ""antisocial"" or ""substance-related disorder"" than their peers. They furthermore suggest that these children may be at increased risk for long-term mortality, persistence of the disorder, and morbidity into adulthood."
23229424,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft demonstrates that the minimally-incisioned approach to total hip replacement does not result in superior results in the first year of follow-up after surgery. However, it does lead to improved pain control and early recovery for patients who have undergone both approaches. The authors conclude that this approach is safe and can be used as a long-term strategy for treating hip degenerative changes. They also report that there is no difference in blood loss between groups at different time intervals during the treatment of patients with limited incisions."
31311165,"Two-year follow-up studies of older adults with falls show that exercise is effective in reducing the risk of falling and improving physical function. The results suggest that exercise can be used as a preventative measure against falls in older adults who have limited health or are frail. This paper also discusses the use of wearable technology to track physical activity, which may lead to less weight loss than standard behavior change approaches."
22829395,"The results of this study suggest that a patient-centered, evidence-based approach to treating fractures may be more cost effective than traditional approaches. In addition, it is possible for physicians to use case-management to increase the frequency and severity of treatment for patients with low-risk fractures. A nurse case manager increases the frequency of testing and prescribing of Osteprasis medication but does not lead to an improvement in quality of care. Furthermore, there is no difference in the rate of bone mineral assessment or treatment among patients who receive either a written letter or a follow-up visit."
28658720,"In this paper, the authors present a close-up analysis of the safety and efficacy of blf in preterm newborns. They conclude that it is safe and effective for prophylactic treatment of neonates with congenital or acquired scarlet fever. Their results suggest that buffalin can be used as an anti-HCV agent to treat patients with severe hepatiitis."
25926889,"This paper presents the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study of patients with hip fracture who had low levels of vitamin D at the time of their surgery. They found that patients with higher levels were more likely to have lower pain scores after surgery than those with lower levels. The authors conclude that there is little evidence for a relationship between blood levels of 1,25-Hystericalvitamin D and post-surgery outcome."
28780542,"Conclusions A combination of behavior-mobility, blood glucose data, lifestyle behaviors, and patient Self-Management data individually examined and presented with Evidence -based guideline to physicians substantially reduce glycerated haemoglobin levels. This suggests that integrating peer-led education, nurse coordination, and three-g wireless technology may be an effective strategy for improving diabetes outcome in high risk population. In this study, the combination of peer-led Education, Nurse Coordination, and Three-G Wireless technology is an efficacious approach for improving disease outcomes in highrisk population. The results emphasize the use of ""p and as decision aid,"" which improves self-management by reducing decisional conflict between patients and their careproviders. Consistently, case management does not result in improved key physiological outcomes for low-risk subjects with Type 2 diabetes. An intervention of community-level health-workers did not improve major cardiovascular events, death, or microvessel complications; however, these approaches were not fared significantly better than typical care in gaining gycemic control.""

22917983,"Oros-MPH continues to be a good treatment for adults with mild-to-mid-life ADHD. However, there is some evidence that it does not improve long-term health in adulthood. In this paper, we review the efficacy of morphine-methale as an alternative to standard treatment for children and adults with moderate or severe forms of the disorder. We conclude by stating that although stimulant treatment has been shown to be more effective in short-term studies than in longer-term ones, they are still poorly tolerated in larger populations."
14584022,"In this study, we examine the effects of long-term calcium supplementation on bone loss in women with and without menopause. We find that a high amount of trace mineral intake is sufficient to prevent bone loss but that it does not reduce the risk of fractures in these women."
30202163,"The results of this prospective, i.e. endodontic study suggest that cement may be suitable for rootend filling; however, it is found that the efficacy of the treatment depends on the patient's quality of rootfilling and the length of the healing period. In addition, there are no significant differences in the success rate of MTA or Super Eba as root-ending filling material when compared to other materials."
31374820,"In this paper, the effects of different bonding strategies on bond strength of two different types of resin cements are examined. The first is a thermocycling-based cement, which loses half of its initial strength at a given rate of time. The second is an all-bond universal cement with a higher bond strength than either of the other two cements. This paper discusses the latest developments in surface-treatment methods for bonding between polymergiously bonded Zirconia and other tooth-hardening materials."

24615862,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights focuses on the effect of resistance training on strength and muscle mass in patients with spinal cord injury. It is concluded that resistance training can be used as a preventative measure against future injury by reducing the risk of overuse and fatigue. This paper also discusses the benefits of exercise training for improving propulsion capacity of wheelchairs."
25238582,"Clonidine extended-release tablet is well tolerated in the study, and significantly improved symptoms in this child population. Conclusions That comorbed treatment with a ""tic disorder"" has limited effects on ADHD outcome; however, we should be cautious because there are few studies of children with tic diagnoses. The effect of mipramine on attention is due to 'a combination of dopamineic and noradrenerergic mechanisms'. Although some evidence suggests that an association between Desipramin and sudden death may be weak, it is still important to confirm these conclusions before using any more specific numerator. Oros Mh was found to be particularly effective at reducing symptoms both of ADHD and oppositionality. Both drugs had significant decreases in Urinary and Plasma MHPG concentrations after the second week but were not associated with any more serious side effects than either drug alone"
27512972,"In this chapter, the authors present a summary of their previous studies on pentoxificationlline. They conclude that it is safe and well tolerated, but that it does not improve left ventricular functions in patients with ""idiated dilate cardiomyopathy"" or other hetological diseases. The conclusion furthermore suggests that PTF may be an effective anti-inflammatory agent for patients with syphilis. PentoXifylline appears to have some beneficial effects on blood pressure, phosphorus excretion, and pro-inflammatory markers."
29098982,"This paper focuses on the use of the Becky-D test as an assessment tool for patients with suspected head injury. It also discusses the use and performance of the Kemp-Doll test, which is used as a stand-in-waiting test for players who have been involved in a serious accident. The results suggest that this test may be more sensitive to changes in players when they are subjected to sideline or post-injury testing than it is to acutely affected players."
25429224,"In this paper, Conclusions focuses on the association between hip and spine fractures as they relate to mortality. The risk of death is increased for patients with a low trauma fracture but not for those with an extra capsulear fracture. This paper discusses the importance of early intervention in order to prevent further fractures from occurring. For example, one study reports that women who have a high-risk fracture are three times more likely to develop a second fracture after their menopause than women without a previous fracture."
21911628,"Conclusions A physician-practism teamwork intervention improved bp control and reduced the average visit costs for patients with elevated blood pressure. This was especially important in patients with high risk of hypertension, who had poor adherence to their medication regimens. Conscious that pharmacists may be more cost effective than physicians in managing these patients, this paper concludes by describing an evidence-based ""hypotensive"" patient treatment program. The results were similar to those seen in other studies; however, they did not lead to significant changes in blood pressure levels."
22748994,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft discusses the benefits of a systematic approach to evaluating the safety and efficacy of orthodontic treatment. It is important to note that there are some drawbacks to using a single-stage or two-stage method for bonding, as these methods may lead to significant bias."
31230196,"In this paper, the authors present evidence for the use of abiotics as an aid in the treatment of children with cow's milk-protein allergy. They conclude that sensitization to food is low and that there might be some ongoing low-grade inflammation in infants who are not intolerant to dairy. Conclusions: IgE can persist to school age; it is a common risk factor for others atopies. Consequences: Ehcf+LGG improves growth and resolution of symptoms but does not lead to improvement in head circumference or weight gain. These conclusions should be confirmed in larger studies."
24338903,"This paper discusses the efficacy and drawbacks of two different types of exercise therapy for women with neck pain: stretching exercises and manual therapy. The results are mixed, but there is a minor difference in the effectiveness of either treatment. For example, APE seems to have a significant reduction in cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors while Srt has a modest increase in physical activity. Conclusions These results suggest that worksite intervention can be used to prevent and restore self-re reported productivity loss caused by UED. In particular, cupping therapy appears to be more successful in relieving pain and symptoms related to carpal tunnel Syndrome than other forms of exercise."
21177660,"Conclusions In older men with low total testosterone levels, risk of stroke or Type Ia is increased. Men with high-normal testosterone levels have an increased risk of dying over the next 20 years. Further studies need to be undertaken to determine whether intervention that raises blood circulating levels might prevent this disease."
19588396,"The purpose of this study is to assess the association between funded trials and conclusions in randomized drug trials. A total of 370 studies were included in this study, including a pooled list of 167 eligible meta-analysiss. This paper concludes by comparing the results of these studies to those of other published studies. In particular, it shows that funding, treatment effect, and doubleblinding are the only predictors for concluding that an experimental drug is superior to placebo in terms of efficacy. Conclusive evidence suggests that there may be some advantage over tricyclic drugs such as fluoxamine in treating major depression."
21929322,"In this paper, the authors present a systematic review of the effects of exercise on older adults. They conclude that there are no significant differences between self-reported physical activity and health-related measures at 12 months' follow-up in patients with knee problems. However, they note that fear of falling is more common among older people than in other community dwelling and sick nursing cohorts. Thus, further studies need to be conducted to determine whether changes in physical performance can lead to improved health or not."
26996098,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of exercise as a strategy for improving physical function in breast-cancer patients. He concludes by stating that resistance training is more effective than stretching at improving muscle strength and fatigue during the early stages of treatment. A randomized, controlled trial has been conducted to determine whether an eight-week exercise program can be used to reduce the severity of fatigue and improve quality of life after breast cancer treatment. The results suggest that ""exercise training"" may have some longer term effects on patient-rated outcome."
15877905,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the effects of iron treatment on infants with anemia who have poor blood levels. Although there are no significant differences in birth histories, socioeconomic status, or general nutrition, it is not clear whether iron therapy is sufficient to reverse psychological and physical disturbances in these children. Iron deficiencies may serve as markers for a wide variety of nutritional disadvantages that might adversely affect child development. However, studies have shown that iron treatment can improve motor and language function in some children with severe anemia. This study adds further evidence that iron treatments can be used to delay or prevent early-onset disease."
24769422,"This paper concludes that there is no protective association between high-circulating levels of a certain amount of vitamin D and the risk of developing multiple scleroids. Conclusions and Reneval High-dose, long-term use of this treatment does not lead to significant changes in serum calcium levels; however, it does lead to a reduction in the severity of the disease."
28538328,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the association between exercise and injury risk in military recruits, particularly women. It uses a step test to identify women at high risk for injury before they enter the military. Women with higher levels of physical fitness are more likely to be injured than those with lower-levels of physical activity. The study concludes by identifying that women with greater body mass and lower aerobic fitness have an increased chance of developing injuries during their training. Men with higher athletic abilities tend to have less risk of injury than women with lower bodies. Athletic training is also associated with higher risk of fractures among male soldiers. In addition, men who do not participate in vigorous physical training often develop stress fractures. These findings suggest that there may be a need for preventive measures against these kinds of injuries."
25516002,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, cross-linking, single-arm study of wear on polyethylene bearing surfaces. The mean wear rate for the two groups is significantly lower than that of conventional polyethylene; however, the long-term follow-up does not show any significant difference in terms of complications. Furthermore, the patients with longer-lived hips have a better chance of survival than those with conventional bearings."
30576798,"In this chapter, the authors present a novel approach to treating patients with acute and chronic coronary disease. They describe a short-term regimen consisting of high dose statins followed by a long-term combination of low-dose simvastain and vasodipine. The efficacy of this regimen is compared to that of other anti-inflammatory or anti-lipidemic approaches. This study suggests that early statin treatment may have an important benefit in patients with severe acute coronary diseases. Aiming to further investigate the use of statin for patients with moderately elevated lipid levels, we conclude that it does not improve their resistance to heart failure. However, our results suggest that earlier statin therapy might be useful in these patients because it reduces inflammation. At least one patient has reported that stroke patients received atorvastan 80mg immediately after a stroke but showed a lower mean National Indians of Heart Stroke Score and modified rankin scores than those not treated with either statin or placebo. These results indicate that ATORVAstatin should be used as a preventative measure against atheroscian thrombosis."
23097268,"The aim of this study is to determine the effect of a low fat, energy restriction diet on weight loss and risk factors in patients with pre-cancer obstructive liposis. In this study, over 1209 overweight adults were randomly assigned one of five different diets to reduce their body weight or prevent it from regaining. The results showed that the low-fibricated diet was more beneficial than the high-fat, energy restricted diet; however, they did not show any significant change in body composition or lipids during the weight loss phase. A large European study suggests that a moderate amount of carbohydrate replacement leads to greater weight loss but does not lead to significant changes in blood lipid levels. This study concludes that replacing some dietary carbohydrates byprotein in an ""adlibitum"" fat reduction diet can improve weight loss without increasing energy expenditure."
21684488,"In this paper, the effects of early mobilization on patients with a Colles fracture are investigated. After six weeks of immobilization, patients recover significantly better in their wrists than those who receive no active therapy after the fracture. This suggests that early mobilisation is an effective treatment for such fractures and may lead to faster recovery. However, it is important to note that there are still other risk factors associated with these fractures which should be taken into account before further intervention is necessary."
28143406,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of our previous studies on atrial thrombopathies and their implications for interventional therapy. We conclude by concluding that there are no major concerns during and after cardinal surgery; however, ascorbicacin does not reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation after percutaneous angioplasty. Conscious of the fact that these patients may have reduced inflammatory factors, conclusive evidence suggests that vitamin C might be useful in treating these patients."
22162279,"In this paper, we present the results of a double blinded clinical trial in which foot orthoses were used as a stand-in-waiting treatment for patients with recurrent arthritis. The results suggest that there is no clear advantage to using foot braces over placebos in the early course of RA. Furthermore, younger age predicts greater improvements in walk time and pain after intervention with feet braces. This suggests that further studies are necessary to determine the efficacy of foot arch supports."
23867029,"Conclusions This is the first large-scale, centrally randomized trial of comprehensive coronary risk reduction in patients with moderate to severe convalescent periods. The results show that there is no significant difference in mortality between the intervention group and the control group; however, this does not affect the overall effect of the study. In contrast, the rate of lumel narrowing appears to be reduced in men and women who are at high risk for coronary disease. After six years of ""middle-aged men,"" there is significant improvement in Lipoprotein levels as well as physical work capacity which results in an improvement in disease progression. Conscious of the need for further research on patient education, especially regarding the most effective method of education delivery, the authors conclude that it is necessary to develop more evidence-based treatments for patients with heart disease."
27900447,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the association between consumption of sugary sweetened beverages and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. They conclude that a diet high in refined grains, fruits, vegetables, and dairy may reduce the risk of heart disease. Furthermore, they suggest that substituting whole grain foods with milk may improve lean mass and growth for children. These conclusions are supported by an extended observational period of follow-up studies. Conclusions The implication of this observation is that frequent fried food consumption is associated with elevated risk of incident Type 2D and moderate to severe gout among women."
24985387,"Conclusions The timed up and go test is used as a measure of walking function in the first five weeks after stroke. It is recommended that patients be measured at a fast pace to detect changes in their walking ability during this period. In addition, studies have shown that older adults are better able to track change in walking performance when they use the 5mWt than those who do not. This suggests that it is important for physicians to use these measures as outcome measures in stroke treatment. A chair with a high seat height and turn direction can lead to greater risk of falls than individuals without a stroke. These results suggest that people recently discharged from home are at greatest risk of falling."
26558538,Meloxicam and pregabalin are both effective for treating pain in patients with ostearthritis. They also suggest that the combination of morphine and naivete may be an effective treatment strategy.
22930416,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of neurofeedback on children with and without ADHD. Although it does not seem to work specifically for children with or without ADHD, it does have some promising side-effects. For example, there is a significant reduction in hyperactivity in children who receive a double blinded treatment. However, these results do not predict long-term efficacy when used as part of an extended treatment regimen. Furthermore, even after initial symptoms are improved, children with mixed-type ADHD show significant impairment in adulthood."
26000442,"In this paper, we present the results of a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial of two different diuretic regimens. The first is to be used as an initial treatment for patients with moderate or severe hypertension who have not responded to other antihypertensive treatments. The second is intended as a follow-up study in order to determine whether these newer and more effective diuretics can reduce the risk of adverse effects on blood pressure."
17239674,"In this paper, we report the results of a large-scale observational study in which patients with obstructive valvuline thrombs were found to be at high risk of having an adverse event due to their resistance to aspirin. This is significant because it suggests that there may be a higher risk of fatal events associated with such low-dose or entericcoated aspin than those who are not susceptible to these side effects. We conclude that although aspriin resistance is more common in patients with stable chest artery disease, most patients do not show any signs of aspidin resistance."
28455948,"The aim of this study is to determine whether a short-message service, such as a ""Micro Letter"" program, can be used to improve patient adherence to blood pressure medication in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Although the intervention did not improve physical activity or quality of life, it was beneficial for both heart disease and Type 2 diabetes patients. In addition, there were no significant differences between waist circumference among Type 2 and heart disease patients. This paper will provide early evidence for the use of information-gathering methods in lower middle-incorme country settings with limited Numeracy and Literacy skills."
31969830,"The results of this study suggest that a supervised walking exercise program can be an effective means for improving exercise performance in people with intermittent caudication. In contrast, strength training does not improve walking performance. New and Noteworthy: A supervised walk exercise program is more effective than a 12-week regimen of strength training. Furthermore, the addition of a resistance training session does not lead to further improvements in walking performance after 24 weeks of vigorous exercise. Conclusions Both types of exercise are superior to one another in terms of physical performance. However, both forms of exercise have significant effects on blood flow and lung vascular resistance. These results suggest that resistance training may be useful in patients with chronic artery disease."

25529265,"The results of this study suggest that walking can be an effective treatment for patients with chronic back pain. Walking improves pain, sleep, fatigue, tender points count, and fitness in a mixed group of patients. In particular, there are no significant differences between the eight-week walk program and advice to stay active in knee OA patients. This suggests that exercise may be useful as a treatment for these patients. Both groups show improved pain and functional status over the next six months. However, both groups do not report improvement in other measures of health or quality of life."
28150351,"Conclusions In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the evidence for the use of magnesium as ananthesitant in type 2 diabetes. We conclude that it is unlikely that improved risk prediction will be meaningfully altered by taking advantage of novel risk-factors such as elevated blood levels or increased glycemia. However, our results suggest that higher doses of magnesium can be used to improve control and prevent long-term complications. Furthermore, there are few reports of any significant benefit from statin therapy in patients with Type II disease. A recent study suggests that adding nicacin to high-cholesterol-lowering therapy does not lead to significant reductions in major artery events but increases the risk of severe adverse events."

It also discusses the use of percutaneous drainage as an alternative treatment for patients with acute calculus. The results of this study suggest that early laparcotomy is superior to conservative treatment in terms of mortality and morbidity.
25358395,"Conclusions This conclusion concisely summarizes the conclusions of this paper. Consclusions A combination of weight Loss and exercise produces greater improvement in physically function than either treatment alone. Specifically, it suggests that a diet plus exercise program provides better results in terms of physical function than both intervention alone. In addition, it reduces blood lipid concentrations by eliciting weight loss. Furthermore, it improves performance measures of pain and function in older overweight or obese adults who have knee obliteration. The additional activity does not confer any additional benefit. Consuming a moderate-intensity diet leads to improvements in body weight and fat mass as well as changes in glucose levels. However, there is no significant change in lipophosphoprotein content for dieters without exercise. Although initially successful, the treatments studied here are not effective in creating long term changes in behavior, weight, orphysiological parameters. For example, weight loss over a six-year period reduces the risk of Type 2 diabetes among those with low-stained-fat diets. Diet and exercise also lead to a decrease in the rate of type 2 disease among patients with elevated lipoproprotein levels. These findings highlight the importance"
21757258,"Conclusions In this paper, we present the results of a large, well-planned, and well-respected trial of essrt in combination with 6 months of leprolide as first-line treatment for patients with castration-responsive metastatic prostatecancer. The results suggest that eSrt may not compromise care but significantly reduce overtreatment associated with art. Furthermore, conclusive evidence suggests that rogenpriming does not do anything to improve efficacy; however, our results emphasize the fact that biologic behavior of prostatutes is different from that of other types of malignant disease. A new gonadothroin-releasing Hormone-releasing hormone antagonist vs Leuprolide provides improved PSA controls in a one-year phase III study involving patients who have metastaticcastration-resistant breast cancer."

In addition, Lactobacilus GG appears to be particularly effective at preventing the initial onset of opportune eczyma in prematurely bred infants. However, there is no significant difference in the severity of the symptoms between the group receiving probiotic treatment and the control group. Pregnatal and post-pregnatal supplementation with B. boidum, B.lactis A011 or L. acidphilus A031 reduces the frequency of occurrence of IgG-related ear hysteria by 2 years but does not lead to an increased risk of developing severe asthma."

He concludes that there are limited external validity of the major asthma treatment trials published by the Guideline for Inhaled Corticosteroid Use in the United States and other countries. The results suggest that Ltra can be used as an add-on to primary care patients with current asthma. However, it is not proved at two years. This article also discusses how observational studies or pragmatic trials may have utility in addressing unansweered and/or unanwerable questions. It also suggests that inhaler devices may have bearing on clinical outcome."
24652723,"The results of this large-scale study suggest that lifestyle changes can be used to prevent Type 2 diabetes in adults with a high risk of developing the disease. Although small changes in weight or physical activity are associated with reduced risk factors for Type 2 disease, they do not lead to significant changes in blood sugar levels over time. This suggests that an intervention based on lifestyle changes may be more cost effective than other approaches."

Both groups were better able to control their blood pressure than control subjects. The study concludes by comparing the effect of the use of a patient-centered, web-based Dss with that of telemedicine. Although patients with ""moderate"" hypertension were more frequently seen in the test practice than in the control practice, there was no significant difference in the management of these patients."

29358960,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of a naivete meta-study on the effectiveness and efficacy of two different approaches to relieving pain in primary patients with primary dissipation. Moxibustion seems to be more effective than conventional therapy for treating menstrual painfulness; however, there are some drawbacks: it does not rule out psychological factors that may have been involved during the treatment process; no blind procedure was used; and no sham controls were used because of availability. A pooled analysis of the effects of three different acupuncture treatments on women with primary miscarriage showed no significant difference in terms of severity of pain."
23543544,"In this study, we examine the effects of a combination of enteral prebiotics and probiotics on growth and health in infants. Prebiotics seem to have a significant protective effect against infectious disease during the first six months of life. However, there is a trend towards a lower risk of serious infection due to the presence of endogenous pathogens. The authors conclude that early-infancy formulas are safe and well tolerated; however, they do not reduce the frequency or severity of fever episodes. They suggest that an immunemodulating effect may be the main mechanism of action for preventive infection in preterm babies. A trial was registryed at Isrct N1621 1826. It showed no change in growth, crying, vomiting, or regurgitation pattern between the two groups. Infants received formulas with either PDX or GOS/GOSS alone were welltolerated but did not affect intestinal micosal function. This study suggests that glutamine enriching enteral nutrition increases the infection rates in VLBw infants because it induces the mucousal inflammation. Probiotic administration reduces intestinal and avicular infections in healthy newborns during the"

30788262,"This paper presents a novel approach to exercise for older adults. It uses a combination of home-based resistance training and body-strength training to improve physical function, balance, and mental health in older women. The results suggest that resistance training can be used as an effective treatment for patients with saropenic obesity because it reduces pain and disability, improves executive function, and improves quality of life. A two-year balanced retraining program is more successful in preventing falls than other forms of exercise. In addition, the addition of either at or rt to WL has been shown to have positive effects on improving health-related qualities of life in older people."
11279717,"This paper focuses on the use of practice-based education to improve the care of patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. It concludes that this approach is safe and effective, especially for patients who are not actively using it. However, there was no improvement in metabolic control in the control groups. In contrast, the new system improved both knowledge and foot health scores. The results were made: ""The Computer-Adulterment Protocol"" resulted significantly in compliance with the Diabetes Care standards. A quality circle was used to evaluate the quality of the care received by 25 patients before and after participating in the quality circle. These results showed significant improvement in the detection of disease-related complications as well as improvements in patient satisfaction. Conclusions Based on problem-based learning, decision support systems were more effective than individual physician guidance but did not diminish over time. Conscious of the importance of local knowledge and creativeness, primary care physicians took part in an annual meeting of the American Diabetes Association. They also attended regular peer reviews of theiradherence to the national standard of care."
19588334,"This paper focuses on the use of resistance training to improve strength and power in older people with depressed mental health. It concludes that ""no strength training or all-round, functional training"" is effective for improving physical capacity among older people without affecting heart function. In particular, it suggests that endurance training can be used as a preventative measure against falls in older women who have chronic heart failure. The authors suggest that moderate intensity resistance training might be more effective than low intensity exercise because it reduces the risk of falling. However, there are no significant differences between the effectiveness of two training regimens. For example, one group uses heavy loads during an explosive resistance training program while the other uses lighter loads during light resistance training. Both groups show improved changes in body mass, strength, and agility at different velocity levels. They also suggest that weightlifting may be useful in elderly patients with airflow limitation. Isokinic exercise is particularly effective for treating knee Ostearthritis but a less expensive education program also shows some benefits"
27631314,"In this paper, we summarize the results of two recent studies. First, we report that combining laparoscopic and ERP surgery leads to shorter post-opmentary stays for elderly patients. Second, we describe a study in which we compare the efficacy of fast track and enhanced recovery after open colectomy. We conclude by concluding that both approaches lead to improved patient safety and reduced long-term hospital stay. Finally, we present a detailed review of the evidence for improving patient outcomes after colonic surgical procedures."

It concludes that it is feasible to regulate private pharmacies at the district level as well as at the national level. However, there are other alternative strategies that need to be taken to improve performance and practice in these areas. For example, an integrated management of childhood illness training was useful but insufficient to achieve high quality pneumonia cases. A simple graphic pathway analysis could identify specific 'common errors' that health workers made in the case management process. The results of this study support further improvements in treatment of malaria by using rapid diagnostic tests."
19821388,"The results of this study suggest that a long-term, high intensity exercise program is safe and effective in improving the health of patients with mild to moderate RA. In addition, it does not increase the severity of the disease or cause of disability. Although all patients experience some benefit from home exercises, they are cautioned against using these methods in patients with severe rheimatic disease. This paper also discusses the use of weight bearing exercises as an exercise modus operandi for patients with moderate to severe musculoskeletal disease."

These results appear to have some effect on bone mineral density and size in older men who are deficient in testosterone. We suggest that they should be followed throughout the treatment as it may reduce the risk of complications from excessively high levels of testosterone. This suggests that both testing and placebo therapy might be effective for treating hypogonal men with low concentrations of testosterone. Both treatments seem to have their own beneficial effects on bone health but do not improve quality of life."

27655114,"In this chapter, the narrator discusses some of the most recent advances in the field of anti-cancer therapy. He concludes that ""torture replacement"" is not associated with any significant improvement in blood lipid levels in older men who are already at risk for coronary disease or heart failure. However, his conclusions suggest that testosterone may be useful as a preventative measure against these dangers. Short-term treatment increases lean mass and improves physical function in elderly men with elevated T levels. Men with low testosterone levels do not show any changes in their quality of life; however, they have little psychological change. They also report that transdermal treatment does not improve bone mineral density but does increase fat mass. A small pilot study shows that testosterone can improve cognition in men with mildly depressed brains. The effects of short-term treatments seem to be independent and selective. For example, one study suggests that long-term use of testosterone might lead to improvements in mental health in patients with severe cardiovascular disease. Another study reports that there is no association between high-dose steroid therapy and increased risk of fatal adverse events. This paper provides an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the use of"
19346937,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of a large-scale, long-term observational study on the effects of daily doses of both total and total-calcinationally-supplerated vitamin D on risk for breastcancer. Although there is some evidence that these two measures may be able to reduce the severity of disease in women who are already pre-malnourished, it is not concluding that all-cause risk is reduced by either an adequate amount of or inadequately-fortified milk. We conclude that ""milk and infant formula prepareds rarely contained the amount ofvitamin D mentioned on the label"" and that ""both underfortifying and overfortingification are hazardous."" Consistently, however, studies have found no association between total caloric and total blood levels of vitamin D with risk for rheumatoid malignancies. Furthermore, our findings do not suggest any relationship between total mineral status and 25-HystericalvitaminD levels with subsequent breastcarcinoma risk. This finding needs to be repeated in other population groups because further studies need to be performed."

We find that physical activity is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease in early adulthood, but it is not clear whether this association is due to genetics, lifestyle, or other factors. The results suggest that exercise training can be used as a preventative measure against childhood obesity. Athletic participation is also strongly associated with improved bone mass in pre-oddalescence. Boys are more likely to be physically active than girls because of their higher school grades. This suggests that there may be a positive effect of physical activity on youth's health."

They conclude that the technique of gasless or low-pressure is superior to those of conventional anesthesia in terms of patient comfort and recovery. However, they note that the timing of Intravenous Anesthesia does not influence the early recovery after anaesthesia; instead, it increases the risk of side effects. The results suggest that total intravenous anesthesia can reduce the rate of spontaneous vomiting in the early postoperative period. Acute pain assessment using a visual scale and standard multimodic pain treatment are necessary for improved pain relief."

It also discusses quality-assessment methods that can be used to assess the efficacy of strength training in older women who are frail or have other physical limitations. In this paper, LiFE is shown to be as effective as ""high intensity"" exercise for most measures tested. The results indicate that exercise training can improve health care use and reduce falls in older people with hip injuries. A six-month outpatient rehabilitation program using progressive resistance training has been found to be more effective than lower intensity exercise for improving functional performance in older patients with hip injury."

20585256,"In this paper, we describe the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study of older women in Spain. We found that poor function is associated with high risk of falls among older women and that ""immediate memory"" is independent risk factors for recurring falls in people aged 75 years or older. Poor vision and balance are also strongly associated with higher risk of fall. Men with lower bioavaricating testosterone levels are more likely to fall than those with greater physical performance. Age-related changes in gait may increase the risk of an older woman's falling. The use of echocardiography as a fall risk assessment tool can be used to predict whether someone will fall over the next year. This test uses four easily measured predictors to predict future falls in elderly people."

27903955,"Conclusions Walking does not improve walking speed or quality of life for people with Type 2 diabetes. However, there are multiple causes of Type 2 disease that are distinct from those of other patients. A home based walking program is more effective than a shorter-term exercise regimen in improving blood sugar control over a 24-week period. Women with Type 1 and Type 2 have different risk factors for death from their respective diseases."
30880409,"This paper focuses on the effects of fibers on weight loss and body mass-index in patients with Type 2 diabetes. In particular, it suggests that adding fiber to breakfast may reduce hunger feelings but does not lead to weight reduction. Furthermore, there are no significant differences between the two groups during the trial. For example, consumption of bran had no significant effect on total energy intake; however, addition of fiber before meals did have an effect on appetite control. However, added fibers were more effective in preventing constipation than they were in improving blood lipid levels. Thus, this study concludes that ""water-insoluble"" fibers can be used as a convenient way to increase fiber content while maintaining good tolerance. The results of these studies suggest that water-insolate fibers should be mixed with food to have the best effect on serumcholestrolemia. Although modest increases were observed in the effect of 10 g PSH/d on low-dental cholesterol relative to the controls, persisting throughout the 24 week treatment period implying potential for long term benefit.

We conclude that CEE increases spine and hip bone mineral densities more than either teripartide or morphine; however, combination therapy does not prevent significant spinal bone loss during the first year of premenopause. Progesterone appears to have short-term effects on blood pressure, weight, vasomotion, and other signs of disease. Cyclic progesterin also seems to improve bone mineral density in women with amenorreha or vulatoric disturbances.

The initial results indicate that the technique does not significantly reduce the amount of infection caused by endodontic pathogens in the canal; furthermore, there is no advantage in using a single visit to control the spread of infection. A comparison between the two approaches is made and it is concluded that the first approach only partially removes the majority of the infection while the second approach completely removes it."
19789953,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the relationship between anxiety and depression in children. It concludes that there is a strong association between maternal anxiety and pre-daternal mood disorder. In addition, it suggests that early treatment of pregnant women with postnatal depression may reduce the risk of adverse outcomes for children."
32108309,"The results of this study suggest that a form of statin therapy can be used to reduce the risk of sudden relapse in patients with high-risk hypercholestrolemia. Aiming to further investigate the safety and efficacy of anti-cholesterab treatment, Wu discusses the use of proproteinconvertingase type 9 ""monoclonal"" antibodies as an alternative to statins for patients with moderately high blood pressure."
20470443,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates the value of using a small, postero-lateral incision for total hip replacement. This technique does not increase the risk of complications and does not lead to long-term changes in hip function. However, it does lead to better pain control, early recovery, and less need for assistive devices during the post-opportunity period."
27479272,"In this paper, Wu discusses the efficacy of combination therapy in treating menopause and vasomobil symptoms. The results suggest that combination therapy is not justified as a treatment for these symptoms. Women with pregestin sensitivities are more sensitive to progesterine than women without them during HRT; furthermore, both regimens reduce the severity of cold flushes. Both regimens have good safety profiles, and Wu concludes that all three regimens are highly effective at relieving mild to moderately hot flushed women. Progesterone-only regimens seem to be better tolerated by Chinese women, although there is no clear explanation for the lack of effect on Japanese women. A 7-day transdermal patch was shown to be safe and effective for relieving moderate to severe postmenopalisal symptoms. This patch also significantly reduced hotflues when compared with placebo. Transdermal patches did not cause any significant side effects, but they did improve quality of life according to the Menopause Scope of Life Questionnaire. These results indicate that pulsed Estrogen therapy at the recommended dose of 150g/day prevents bone losses in a dosage-de"
32187830,"Conclusions In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of a high-carbohydrate diet on fasting bile alpha-hydroxy acid concentrations. He concludes by describing the role of gut flora in weight loss and recommending an orlistat-containing diet for patients who are particularly at risk of colon cancer."

12500920,"In this paper, the authors present results from a prospective, randomized, double-blind, random-experimental study on gastric tumors. They conclude that in patients with advanced gastric disease, it is not possible to use adjuvant regimens because of the high toxicity of these newer regimens. However, they suggest that surgically directed therapy may be an effective strategy for improving survival. A subset analysis suggests that patients withstage III gastric malignancies have improved survival when treated by perioperative Introperitoneal Chemotherapy. This approach does not lead to improvement in overall survival but instead leads to improvements in stage IV and metastatic disease."
26322509,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the most recent evidence on the use of vitamin D as an anti-arrying agent in children with severe persistent asthma. We conclude that a high concentration of 25-hydroxydi-alone is associated with reduced risk of influenza A in Mongolian children who have been deficient in this essential mineral. Furthermore, our study suggests that daily 25-OHD may reduce the risk of acute rhinosis among Mongolian patients with low-dose vitamin D. Conscious of the limited efficacy of this form of treatment, we recommend that further studies should be performed to confirm or deny these conclusions."
24704678,"This paper focuses on the effects of short-term physical and psychological exercises on neck pain. It concludes that exercise and advice can be more effective than usual physiotherapy for neck pain in patients with persistent pain after whiplash. Three years after the end of the campaign, we repeat telephone surveys in Victorian and New South Australia as controls. The results show that patients who received brief psychological education showed improved pain scores at a one-month follow and that those who received pamphlets showed better outcomes. A population-based strategy to provide positive messages aboutback pain improves both the general population's beliefs about backpain and the physicians' attitudes toward back pain. In addition, this study suggests that ""common-based primary preventive intervention"" may be an effective way to prevent chronic pain."
30168261,"This paper focuses on the use of evidence-based practice in the emergency department to guide treatment of whiplash-injured patients. Although there is some evidence for using postural exercises to decrease pain and timeoff work, no evidence supports use of neck stability exercises in treating patients with whiplash injuries. The Canadian C-spine rule has been adopted by the United States and many other countries as an effective preventative measure against whiplash injury; however, it does not lead to improved patient outcomes."

25182102,"In this paper, the authors present a long-term prospective follow-up study of patients with severe obesity who received laparoscopic or open gastric bypass. They conclude that these procedures are safe and efficacious in terms of weight loss and improvement in quality of life. Although there is some disagreement as to which procedure should be chosen for each patient, Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass remains the preferred treatment for morbidly overweight patients."
22353603,"In this study, the effects of two different types of restorative materials on lesions in the cervical region are examined. The giomer is more effective than the other two, with very low retention rates over 18 months. This suggests that tooth surfaces need to be treated prior to use of these newer and more advanced adhesives. However, there is no significant difference in overall performance between the two. Conclusions Both the gimer and the self-etch bonding systems meet the clinical portions of the Acceptation Program Guidelines for dentin and enamel adsives material sestablished by the American Dentin Association. Confusingly, however, all three adhesives perform well after 24 months; they do not affect the patient's long-term health."
11580867,"A meta-analysis of a set of 149 randomized controlled trials is performed to assess the efficacy of antistergan treatment in children with obstructive mammia. The results show that there is no significant improvement in pregnant rate with antistergen treatment; however, there is a slight improvement in maternal relapses after 18 months of treatment."
22161405,"The aim of this paper is to assess the association between funds and conclusions in drug trials. It consists of a pooled analysis of 370 random drug trials from theCochrane library, May 2000. All trials were included in one or more meta-analysis. A significant increase in funding was associated with an increased recommendation for the experimental drug. In addition, studies funded by for profit organizations were more likely to report favorable results than those funded by non-profit organizations. This conclusion does not seem to reflect any treatment effect nor adverse events. Conclusions conclude that these studies may be biased because they do not include trial results."
26081915,"This paper focuses on the effects of bariatic surgery on patients with Type 2 diabetes. It shows that there is a significant improvement in blood lipid levels after ryb surgery, but it does not seem to be related to changes in gut glycerin concentrations. In addition, these results suggest that gastric bypass may have a role in treating obesity."
21053026,"This paper focuses on the relationship between physical activity and back pain. It concludes that there are protective and neutral effects of physical activity on low back pain, while having a ""heavy physical job"" is a risk factor for this effect. The results suggest that exercise and activity can be used as an intervention to improve health in patients with low back Pain."

28376055,"In this first-ever, long-term follow-up study of infants ages 3 and 4 months, the authors conclude that daily doses of 200 iu/d do not seem to provide any additional benefit to the bone. However, their results suggest that higher doses may be necessary for adequate absorption of the active form of the nutrient. For example, at three months, infants on group 1 have a serum concentration of 25-Hycrotin D3, which is significantly higher than those on group 2, but only slightly lower than those in group 2. This suggests that infants should be given a sufficient amount of vitamin D as a preventative measure against disease. A quarter-day supply of 5,000 IU per day with a child vaccination program does not reduce the risk of recurrent outbreaks of diarrheal disease."
25793643,"In this paper, Wu outlines the current state of stroke care in China. Although there are promising new approaches to stroke treatment, it is not yet clear whether these approaches will be as effective as those currently practiced in other parts of the world. For example, one study suggests that an exercise intervention may be more effective than standard medical care for patients with mild-to-stretched ischemic attacks. The authors conclude that education and support should be given to both patients and general practitioners in order to prevent future strokes. However, they do not show any significant effect on long-term follow-up."
24346781,"The results of this study indicate that there are no mental or psychological effects of general anesthesia after three months in elderly people undergoing knee replacement. General anesthesia poses little risk to long term mental function, but it does reduce the need for blood transfusion. Conclusions: our study showed that Sa was superior to Ga in providing post-anaesthesia and declining blood loss while maintaining better periodic bleeding stability without increasing side effects. Confidention and functional competence were not affected by either general or region anaesthesia at any time when attention is paid to these known perioperatic influences on mental functions. In Chinese patients who undergo total knee surgery with spinal anesis/sedation enjoy better post-surgery pain relief than those receiving both types of anaestical techniques. A comparison of 60 patients between spinal anaexics with controlled ventilation shows that the spinal technique has advantages over general Anaestry during surgery; in the initial 24 hours, however, no long-term benefits can be seen."
27859327,"This paper uses a case-control study to examine the effects of a cash transfer program on women's health. In particular, it finds that the program has a lower incidence of sexual activity among the control group and that there is no clear link between the use of cash transfers and improved maternal health."
21890437,"This paper presents a meta-analysis of several studies that have examined the relationship between dairy consumption and height. The most important finding in this study is that dairy products have a strong association with height gain. In particular, milk has a positive effect on weight gain. Furthermore, it is concluded that increasing milk consumption will improve bone mineralization in girls during early adulthood."
28034901,"Conclusions Body mass-index seems to have an important effect on short-term and long- term outcomes after revascularizing. However, it does not influence the risk of mortality or morbidity in patients with high BMI. Furthermore, this study shows that weight reduction is associated with reduced early mortality in patients who are undergoing myocarial re Vascularization."
32176779,"In this chapter, we summarize the efficacy and safety of three different drugs for treating recent-onset acute atrial fibrillation. We conclude that they are equally effective as propaftenone in restoring spontaneous sinus rhythm. Conclusions: Although both drugs proved equally effective in recovering spontaneously from an earlier episode of atrium fibrillation, procainamide acts faster in the load phase. Both drugs seem to be equally effective when it comes to conversion of newly-onset patients to sinus rhythm; however, neither drug seems to have any significant advantage over the other in terms of speeding up the conversion process. Conscious of the fact that these two drugs are more effective than their respective side effects, conclusive evidence suggests that they should be used with greater caution in patients who have recently onset ailment."
31885541,"Probiotics and prebiotics are superior to lifestyle changes alone in the treatment of patients with nafld. In addition, probiotics have a favorable effect on blood lipids as well as on inflammatory markers. These effects may be due to attenuating inflammatory signals in the body; however, further studies need to be performed."
29460165,"In this first study, we assess the safety of a single daily dose of either buspirone or d-methylphenidate in children and adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The results suggest that both treatments are more effective than other treatment regimens for children with symptoms of ADHD. For example, adding one morning dose of adderall to an eight-week regimen can lead to significant improvements in learning and school performance. However, these results do not appear to be reliable predictors of long-term efficacy"
15803086,"This paper presents the results of a prospective, observational study on patients with chronic back pain. It concludes that there is little specificity in the treatment of this group of patients and that it is not possible to predict success or failure by using expert judgment. However, studies have shown that different factors can be used to predict outcome in interdisciplinary care. Finally, further evidence is needed for the use of prediction tools such as activity restriction or participation restriction in primary care."
30364990,Proton Pump Inhibitors Are Associated With an increased Risk of Fracture in Older Adults. This paper concludes that there is no association between the use of proton pump-inhibitors or H2Ras and falls. It is important to note that these two drugs are commonly overused in older adults because of their potential for side-effects.
28459099,Conclusions Walking cadence is a good measure of health status and can be used to predict changes in steps over time. People with higher social standing tend to have higher energy expenditure than those with lower social standing.
24696195,"In this paper, the authors present a meta-analysis of 370 randomized drug trials. They conclude that the experimental drug is most likely to be recommended as ""treatment of choice"" in studies funded by non-profit or for-profit societies. The results suggest that mirtzapine andparoxeten are efficacious when used for 12 weeks in depressive patients who are treated in primary medical care. Mirtzapane appears to produce earlier effects on anxiety and depression than paronox; however, side effects are less likely to result in dropouts than imipramin. Conclusions That both paroxen and amiriptyline are more effective in treating Major Depressive disorder in older patients, which is composed of elderly people who are taking further medication for racial disease."
26378571,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the efficacy and drawbacks of different approaches to preventing heart attack in healthy young adults. They conclude that Dha is not as effective as EPA for preventing stroke in patients with Type 2 diabetes. However, they suggest that a Mediterranean-style diet can be used as a preventative measure against cardiovascular disease."
15513655,"Back pain is the most common cause of sickness absence in the United States, but there are few studies examining the association between back pain severity and work satisfaction. This paper concludes that physicians should not use expert judgment as a basis for decision making about whether to treat patients with back pain. Instead, it should be used as an evidence-based framework for patient management. Neck pain is particularly painful because of trauma. The results of this study suggest that neck pain may be associated with poor social support and lower job satisfaction. A worksite visit does not increase the efficacy of the exercise program; however, it does reduce sick leave for low back pain sufferers. In addition, workers who engage in horoscoped activities have a greater risk of upperlimb and neck shoulder disorders than those who do not participate in these activities."
17923590,"Conclusions Cya is the most effective drug for treating interstitial-cysitis in this study. It has a good effect on average voiding volumes, but there are still some side effects. ICSI is an efficacious measure of changes in symptoms and should be used in future treatment outcome studies in patients with these painful bladder diseases"
24200104,"This paper discusses the use of telephone calls and home visits as a strategy to promote adherence to methadone treatment in heroin patients. The results suggest that these strategies may be more cost effective than standard care for patients who are dependent upon heroin. However, it is important to note that this approach does not lead to improved health outcomes when compared with other approaches."

19526214,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to reducing blood glucose in patients with Type 2 diabetes by replacing refined rice with legumes and whole grain. They conclude that these new approaches may be more effective in reducing the risk of heart disease than diet alone. Their results suggest that adding fiber to the diet can improve blood sugar control in type 2diabetes. This is an important step forward in the use of pulses as a potential treatment for Type 1 and Type 2, although it has not been reported yet."
28756133,"In this paper, we describe the results of a two-pronged approach to improving health in African Americans with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes: 1) an evidence-based telephone intervention; 2) a nurse-led self-management program; and 3) a combination of lifestyle counseling and behavior change. Both groups showed significant reductions in their mean Hba1c levels at six and 12 months after the start of the study. This suggests that physicians can improve blood glucose control in type 2 patients without increasing risk of complications. Nurse-lead therapy is more cost effective than other forms of treatment for patients with Type 1, but it does not lead to improvements in quality of life or patient satisfaction."
31093862,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights focuses on the role of diet, smoking, and elevated TNF-betain in determining adipogenemia in normal weight women. He concludes that anthropometrisms, exercise, and high blood pressure all play a key role in preventing a diponectiemia from occurring in obese women. After bariatic surgery, however, these changes are not associated with any improved markers of inflammatory disease. For example, patients who lost more than two-thirds their body weight during the first three months after surgery lose significant amounts of their body mass. This suggests that they may be at risk for developing multiple comorbidities due to excessive weight."
29257898,"In this paper, Evans and Owens et al. present the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study in which they compare the effects of two different treatment approaches on children with ADHD: parent-centered treatment and behavior-based treatment. Both groups showed significant improvement in symptoms but did not show any change in academic or other measures of performance. However, parents who took part in the ""Coachses"" parenting program reported improvements in their child's health and well being. This is an important finding because it suggests that there may be a need for more evidenced-based treatments for children with moderate- to severe-onset disease."

31485910,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the use of FPC as an alternative to IV iron therapy in patients with hemilysis. He concludes that FPC is safe and can be used as an anemia management regimen for patients with high-feritin levels. A large randomized trial is needed to determine whether IV iron should be given at higher doses than those commonly used in many European or North American dialysis centers. This study does not demonstrate any association between IV iron administration and risk of infection. However, it does show that treatment with FPC reduces the amount of ESA required over a six-month period. It also shows that there are no significant differences in the risk of mortality among patients treated with greater cumulative Intrvenous Iron doses."
20693238,The results of this study suggest that a high level of adherence to treatment is required for patients with moderate to severe forms of Osteoporoseis.
26899439,"This paper focuses on the effects of an irrational education program on patients with high-risk foot problems. In this study, we examine the efficacy of an eight-week educational program in reducing the risk of ulceration and amputation for patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that a brief education program may be effective in preventing these complications."
24737108,"In patients with moderate-to-severe hypertension, initial treatment with T80 or H25 results in a significant reduction in mean blood pressure compared with that of the other two treatments. This suggests that polypills may be more effective than individual drugs in preventing major cardiovascular events. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is performed to assess the efficacy of a combination of aspirin, statin, and diuretic over three months. The results suggest that this combination will lead to improved blood pressure control and reduced risk of heart attack and stroke."
26487439,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective, open-label, single-blind, random-experimentation study in which propranal overdose was used as an effective treatment for patients with moderate to severe anxiety. We conclude that there is no general effect on subjective anxiety for these two active drugs; however, some patients prematurely end up because of side effects. For example, fifteen patients earlyly terminated due to adverse reactions: four taking propranolpholl, four taking placebo, and seven taking chlordisazepoxie. No differences are detected for behavior scores. Consciousness suggests that it may be useful for treating anxiety in individuals who are fearful of dentist treatment. Conclusions suggest that fluoxenine should be given at a higher dose than 20mg daily to treat panic disorder. A case-study study shows that repeated behavior recall can significantly reduce anxiety in surgical patients. This approach works well when performed by non-professionals, including the patient themselves. There is no significant difference in the severity of the case or complications between the two groups. Confidention also suggests that although both surgeons and patients were treated with different doses of propran"
14678922,"In this chapter, the authors present a detailed description of their treatment of adult patients with acute fistfight. They conclude that amiodraone is safe and efficacious for conversion of atrium fibrillation into sinus rhythm. Concurrently, they suggest that low-dose aspirin may be preferable to conventional antithrombotics in patients with intermittent atrial fever. Affective side effects are mild; however, there are significant differences in the rate of conversion from one type of cardioversion to another. The most important benefit of these two approaches is that they can restore normal sinus rhythm after transthorac cardioversion. Both drugs seem to be equally effective in treating chronic atrial Fibrillation. However, it is necessary to note that some patients have greater risk of stroke than others."
16717289,"In both regimens, complete protection declines from the first day of treatment until the last day. The most commonly adverse event is headache. Three mg/Kg doses of Intrvenous Ondansentron are safe and effective; however, there is no significant difference in the incidence of nausea or vomiting between the two treatments over seven days. A prepitant regimen is evaluated for preventive nausea and vomiting after moderately-emetogenic therapy over multiple rounds. Both drugs are well tolerated but constipation is seen more commonly than with either drug. At the dose used, Dolasetron was considerably less effective at controlling nausea during single fraction high dose rate Tbi. There was no significant adverse events due to either dose. No significant complications were observed, in particular not much extrapyramidial reaction due to ondensetron"
31232513,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effects of gastric bypass on drug morphine sensitivity and absorption. They conclude that there is no significant change in the absorption of either ASA or omeprasole after rygb. However, they suggest that patients should be closely watched for any changes in their gastrointestinal tract during the first few years after surgery."
24622671,"In this paper, Conclusions demonstrates that improving the status of both the body's and skin's levels of 25-OHD can reduce the risk of developing certain types of breastcancer. This is particularly important in women with type 2 or Type 1 diabetes because these patients are at greater risk of poor outcome when compared to their non-diabetic counterparts. Conscious of the potential for a direct link between low levels of D and increased risk of death from CVD, it is necessary to conduct a randomized controlled trial."
27039305,"This paper presents the results of a prospective observational study on patients with shoulder pain. The outcome measures used in this study were the Swedish Rivers Disability Questionnaire and the Norwegian shoulder-specific measure, the Spanda. Both measures showed good efficacy in predicting changes in severity over time."
26710217,"This paper focuses on the role of occupational physicians in improving patient resemblance to evidence-based treatment for patients with back pain. It concludes by describing the results of a two-year observational study that showed increased resentment and dissatisfaction among sick-listed patients who were not given adequate care during their first months of illness absence. The authors suggest that this is due to the fact that people hold realistic expectations about what they will do when they return to work, which may lead to improved health outcomes."
24743931,"Conclusions A team-spotter's program is an effective and cost-effective intervention for preventing weight gain in overweight children. Both exercise and physical training are highly effective at reducing body fat and improving blood lipid levels in obese young boys. Athletic training also improves the function of conduit vessel function, which is important for the pathophysiology of vascular diseases. Conscious of the need for more evidence, this study proposes that school-based physical education classes should be used as a preventative measure against childhood obesity. In addition, it has been shown that regular physical activity can reduce the risk of heart disease in overweight patients."
18671894,"Conclusions In this paper, the effects of fortified beverages on hematology and anthropometry are examined. Both groups show significant improvements in growth and Morbidity when compared to self-selective noncomplierrs. The most effective intervention is the daily mimmion treatment, which improves both anemia and iron status as well as other nutrients. This suggests that there may be some health benefits from such a program before pregnancy. Children of women who consume powdered or milk-basedfortified product have mean birth weight greater than 258 and 351 g, respectively. These results suggest that ""the beneficial effect of weekly iron/zin supplementation upon motor development andorientation suggest that infanthood benefit from these minerals when administered together"". However, neither group has any significant changes in growth nor morbidity during the six mo study. All three groups do not develop anemia; however, they remain anemic, zinc depleted, or iron deficient at the final end of the trial. Further research will need to be performed to determine whether more doses of either iron or zinc should be combined with infections control measures. Iron-forted porridge does not induce"
26620873,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates the efficacy of an eight-week course of treatment for patients with moderate- to severe-onset forms of ADHD. The results suggest that symptoms of moderate-to-severe form of the disorder may be improved over the course of the first six months of treatment. However, it is not clear whether these improvements are due to changes in the patient's neuropsychological functions or because of changes in their behavior."
28650969,"The results of this study suggest that the use of the Japanese OKS as a self-assessment tool for knee pain is highly receptive to comparison with other methods. However, both methods are not effective in treating knee OA. Furthermore, they do not provide any additional benefit in relieving pain or improving physical function."
32248344,"In this paper, the authors present a meta-analysis of all available evidence on the efficacy and safety of two different approaches for total hip surgery. The first is an anterior approach with a posterior incision; the second is a mini-antero-horizontal approach with only a small incision. They conclude that both approaches are safe and can be performed by experienced surgeons without significant risk of complications. Their main conclusion is that the technique used to perform THA is safer than the conventional approach because it involves less soft tissue injury and blood loss. However, there are still some drawbacks as to whether or not patients should receive more conservative care during their recovery."
27749375,"The results of this study suggest that music therapy may be a useful intervention for patients with post-operative solid transplants. In addition, it is reported that children who receive more infusions tend to improve their quality of life by being less distressed and reporting less pain than the control group. A follow-up analysis indicates that there is no significant difference between the experimental and control groups on physical function, length of stay, time of death, or severity of pain. This study establishes an overview of palpiative care and suggests that music can be an effective treatment for patients awaiting heart surgery."
14974003,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effects of smoking on patients with acute myosmoky heart disease. They conclude that smoking can reduce the risk of death by halving the odds of dying in those who continue to smoke. Although there is no concluding evidence that smoking should be discouraged for all patients, it is important to note that some studies suggest that stopping smoking may have beneficial effects on short-term and long-term outcomes."
14763716,"Conclusions Surgical Ostemies are effective for relieving pain in patients with previous foot ulcers. The use of custom-made shoes is more cost-effective than other forms of treatment. However, the FFi-5pt score does not provide sufficient evidence to support the use of special shoes or inserts to patients with an ulcerated foot."
28379619,"In this study, the authors conclude that there is no evidence of benefit or harm from initiation of either renin blockade or Aliskiren in patients with high risk of heart failure. They also report that adverse events are more frequently reported in active treatment groups than in placebo-treated patients. This conclusion supports the idea that adding aliskien to standard therapy may be an effective and well tolerated treatment for hypertension. However, it does not lead to further improvement in left ventricular atherosclerotic disease."
23480090,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft discusses the efficacy of using a low-flow air count to reduce the risk of deep wound infection in knee and hip prostheses. The results suggest that there is little difference in the rate of infection among patients treated with either high-flow or low-foul air counts. Although many studies have been published in the journal of bone and joint surgery, few have been randomized. Only half of these trials were randomized; lack of blinded outcome assessment was sufficient to provide confirmation of an improvement in the severity of the wound infection. Conclusions Aiming to use effective antimicrobial preparations prior to surgery can help prevent future complications."
24690623,"The results of this study suggest that higher levels of 25 hydroxyvind concentrations are associated with better survival rate in patients with coloredectal tumors. Conclusions In conclusion, lower serum-25 OHD concentrations might be associated with improved overall survival or distant disease free survival in Postmenopatrasal breast-cancer patients. Consistently, these results do not confirm the association between low 25 OH D concentrations and risk of cardiovascular disease. Further evidence is needed to support the use of vitamin D as a predictor of mortality in patients who have type 1 diabetes."
25616710,"Conclusions The padua score, a risk-response score that predicts the risk of complications in patients with open needle scintination, is used to predict whether or not patients will develop scarlet rheumatia. In particular, we report that red meat consumption has been associated with increased risk of renal cell carcinoma because of its high molecular content. Concluusions This study confirms our earlier previous findings about the association between red meat and papillary disease. We also report that SRMs are more frequent in the first two years of follow-up than they are in other studies."
29883970,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a six-month study of patients with Type 2 diabetes in the United Arab Emirates. The results suggest that daily consumption of 1,000 IU of vitamin D fortified yogurt does not improve their blood lipids or other markers of inflammation. However, there are no significant differences between the effects of high-dose and low-dose forms of treatment. Furthermore, these results do not predict long-term benefits in type 2d patients."
25834421,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates that the six-minute walk test can be used as an accurate and reliable measure of exercise capacity for patients with mild to severe obstrumental disease. He concludes that the 6 minute walk test is more sensitive than the 6-minute walking test for determining changes in exercise response following bronchialation. The results suggest that the endurance walk test may be more effective than the 6 mile walk test in evaluating resistance to bronchodelicacies in patients with acute exaggeration of their disease."
24289848,"The results of this study suggest that the combination of Phyd and exercise are more effective than either treatment alone in improving pain, fatigue, quality of life, and sleep. In addition, it is suggested that Pheida may have a beneficial effect on sleep-related symptoms. A recent meta analysis concludes that multicombinated treatments can be effective for some patients with fms symptoms. An open-label trial was conducted to determine whether a psychological intervention implemented inprimary care is more efficacious than usual care when improving functional status of patient with fever. It was found that the patients who responded were less trait anxious at baseline than not responders. This suggests that a two-month psychoeducal intervention might be more effective as compared to usual care because of the social dissatisfaction bias. However, the risk of side effects does not seem to account for the severity of the patients' response to the intervention. Thus, an eight-week program of self-management based exercises and education could improve the function of patients with Fms. Furthermore, cortical electrodestimulation did not improve pain or fatigue; however, these studies suggest that this form of therapy should be used in cases"
26065374,"In this paper, we describe the results of a two-year idling intervention for children with mild to moderately severe autistic disease. The treatment group produces significant gains in language and social skills while the control group has no significant differences in symptoms or behavior. Parents perceive significant improvements in their children's language, social interaction, and their stress level. These studies are important because they provide evidence that early childhood intervention can be used as a preventative measure against early-onset disorder."
31029060,"In this paper, the authors present a systematic review of the evidence for the role of physical activity in the treatment of children with Jia. They conclude that there is a strong relationship between physical activity and pain in children with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis or Inflammable Bois-Guilbert disease."
28027038,"In this paper, Conclusions outlines the results of a recent clinical trial in which patients with carpal tunnel-symptomis were treated with myofacial therapy. The results suggest that Myofascia therapy could be useful for relieving pain and improving functional capacity over a six-month period. However, it is unclear whether longer daily tethers are more effective than shorter daily ones. This study also suggests that home exercises can be used to improve range of motion after wrist fractures. Although there is no difference between self-reporting arm function and finger extension at post-surgery, confounding evidence suggests that nighttime sprang should not be recommended except where contractures occur."
32359762,"Carnitine is shown to have a beneficial effect on blood lipids in patients with chronic obstructive rheumatism. In addition, it reduces the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by reducing elevated LDL-cholestrol levels. Furthermore, it improves both physical and mental health in patients suffering from type 2 dysteria."
28698929,"In this paper, the authors describe the results of a prospective randomized trial in which they compare the use of patient-specified cutting blocks to conventional instruments for knee arthrostomies. The results show that the patients treated with these devices have a higher prevalence of misalignment than those who were treated with standard instrumentation. This is due to the fact that the device needs to be modified or abandoned frequently. Furthermore, there are no significant differences between the groups in terms of mechanical axes and length of time. Although PSI does not shorten surgery or improve alignment, it does reduce the number of preoperative trays required."
26644891,"In this paper, we present the results of a single-arm, i.e. in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the efficacy of two different probiotics for the treatment of infants with acute tuberculosis. The first product, Lactobacilus GG, was more effective in treating children with recurrent rotavir-infected diarrhea than its competitor, the placebo. Both products reduced the duration of disease by reducing the severity of the disease and increasing the length of time it took to recover. Furthermore, both products had no significant difference in the frequency or severity of nausea during the course of the trial. Although some studies have not yet shown any significant effects, this study assesses systematically the currently known knowledge on the affect of probiotic strains on duration of an acute rottavirus-related diarrhea in children aged 1 year old."
27226400,Preoperative Pulmonary Rehabilitation is a good strategy for patients with mild-to-serious lung disease who have not yet had a chance to undergo a major resection and are therefore not likely to survive the 24 months post-surgery. The results suggest that short-term pulmonary rehabilitation can be an effective strategy for improving patient's health before surgery.
29288248,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the effects of a diet containing a high-sugar content on blood lipid and inflammation. He concludes that short-term consumption of dairy products can lead to favorable biochemical changes in atheroscian markers. A modest increase in either alna or EPA-Dha does not influence mononoclear cell function. Consumption of these two fatty acids is sufficient to induce anti-inflammatory effects in cultured human monocytes. These results suggest that a moderate amount of dietary fat may be an effective strategy for improving risk factors for Type 2 and Type 3 disease. The authors also note that there are no significant differences between the three diets in terms of body composition. For example, a daily consumption of only three g of cis 9, trans 11, or t10 cl isomers reduces total and lower body mass in overweight men. However, they do not show any effect on other inflammatory markers such as CRP or fibrinogen. Furthermore, their results do not support the use of LC-LA as an over-the-counter weight loss aid."
22340263,"Conclusions This chapter summarizes the results of a large-scale European CRT survey, which describes current European practice regarding patient demographics, selection criteria, procedure routines, and post-discharge status. Conscious of the potential for significant long-term improvements in heart failure patients treated with bivalve pacing, conclusive evidence suggests that this form of therapy may be more successful in patients with moderate to severe heart failure."
29556750,"This paper focuses on the use of an evidence-based intervention, or IHCA, to improve health and behavior in people with inflammatory arthritis. Although there is no significant difference between the two groups regarding physical ability or quality of life, it is clear that this type of intervention does not work for patients with a chronic disease."
17054258,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft discusses the benefits and drawbacks of early-electrified laparotomy for patients who have acute gallstone disease. Although there is a higher risk of complications than with conventional open cholangiestectomy, it does not compromise the safety of the procedure. The authors conclude by describing the results of a prospective randomized study to determine the best surgical strategy for patients with mild-to-serious acute bilary colic."
28795075,This paper uses a meta-analysis to examine the relationship between menstrual and contraceptive use to predict the frequency and severity of ankle injuries in women.
31020768,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the association between whiplash injury and neck pain. He concludes that whiplash-induced neck pain is particularly dangerous because it can lead to long-lasting consequences. Neck pain in patients who have been involved in a car accident is especially dangerous because of the potential for long-term disability."
25812929,"This paper focuses on the effects of an eight-day course of physical therapy on patients with long-term back pain. The results suggest that psychological factors are more strongly connected to persistent pain than is the case for shoulder pain. In particular, patients with higher levels of anxiety and depression may have a greater reduction in their disability if they change their attitudes and beliefs about work during the course of the course."
21398350,"The results of this study suggest that growth-hormone treatment is safe and effective in treating children with a short stature, even though the final height is small."
24500904,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the use of continuous passive motion to improve knee ROM in patients who have undergone total knee surgery. He concludes that it is not sufficient to increase range of motion for patients with severe knee arthrosis because there is no significant relationship between posterior slope of cut and the post-opportunity ROM. A study evaluating the efficacy of continuously passive motion as an alternative to standard physiotherapy in patients with knee pain shows that CPM does not offer any additional short-term benefits than standard physical therapy."
16856115,"In this study, the effects of morphine on patients with mild-to-moderate anxiety are examined. Although buspirone has a slightly slower anxicolytic activity than opazimin, it does not lead to significant improvement in symptoms after two weeks. Both drugs reduce anxiety more rapidly but with greater side effects. The main differences between the two drugs are seen in side effects and vital signs. Conclusions: Buspirone seems superior to placebo for improving anxiety in patients with moderately severe GAD. However, there is some evidence that social conditions may play a role in its efficacy. Short-term psychological therapy was effective for patients who had coexisting serious anxiety disorders. Cliniical Implications and Limitations: There were no major differences in outcome from the three groups upon any physician measures or subject measures; these results add to theunderst anding of treatment of these anxieties."
23544806,"The present study demonstrates that early gut colonies with beneficial bacteria can reduce the risk of developing necrotizing Enterocolitis in prematurely bred infants. In addition, it shows that probiotic treatment at a dose of six to eight liters per day does not reduce the severity of the disease. Furthermore, there are no significant differences in the number or severity of pathogens found in preterm and very low-birth-women infants when compared to controls."
21874111,"In this paper, we summarize the results of three randomized phase III studies on gastric and epitomeal tumors. The first is ILF, followed by PLILF; the second is XP, which does not have any significant advantage over FAM in treating advanced gastric disease. Both regimens show modest efficacy but do not appear to be suitable for all patients. All three regimens are considered superior to the FaMTX or ECF regimens in terms of survival and response. They also fail to produce improvement in quality of life when compared with conventional treatment. Finally, they conclude that both regimens can be used as adjuvants in patients with advanced-staged gastric malignancies."
31147627,"In this paper, Wu et al. present the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study on men with and without prostate cancer. They found that leptine is independent of body composition and PSA in patients with or without prostatic disease. However, their results do not seem to support the notion that hyperintensity influences risk of overall or aggressive Prostate Cancer. Furthermore, they did not find any association between Leptin levels and histology grade or disease stage. Further studies need to be performed to confirm these results."
25953458,"In this paper, Conclusions discusses the results of a large epidemiological study on voice disorders. The results suggest that experienced speech pathologist can distinguish Ad'SD from M'Td with a High degree of specificity and sensitivity based on ""spectral analysis"". These results will be valuable in future studies to determine whether or not treatment for children with caustic voice disorder should be used. This is the first randomized control trial to treat CAS. After treatment, there is no more autonomic complaints or symptoms related to voice than healthy controls. There is also a reduction in the frequency of these complaints when compared to patients who receive conventional therapy."
25690684,Conclusions This paper focuses on the use of the Ashworth scale as a tool for assessing spasticity in patients with a stroke. It uses the Masc score as an outcome measure and suggests that it may be useful in predicting severity of injury.
21936895,"This paper focuses on the relationship between physical activity and health in children aged 5 to 17 years. It uses a cross sectional study of African American girls as controls. The results suggest that the switch program has modest effects for preventing childhood obesity, but it does not have a significant effect on body mass index. In addition, there is no significant association between short sleep duration or increased television viewing. Children who spend more time playing games are at greater risk of being overweight than those who spend less time sitting."
25560629,The results of this study suggest that the use of a virtual reality-based training program can be used to improve balance and gait in older people with hemiparetic disease.
28453714,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the role of women's economic and social capital in reducing intimate partner violence in Africa. He uses a case-control study to examine the effects of a group-based health education program on maternal and child well-being in poor rural African countries. The results indicate that well-made health educational campaign can be effective as a tool to raise awareness and promote health-enhouring practice in poor settings. However, there is no significant difference in child health outcome between control and intervention groups. This suggests that community-based approaches may be more cost effective than individual randomized trials."
23965711,This paper presents the results of a prospective observational study on changes in foot and ankle function scores. The results suggest that changes in these scores can be used to predict changes in outcome in patients who participate in controlled trials or in planning new trials. These results may aid physicians in interpreting patient reported outcomes during treatment.
12939895,"In this paper, Wutherings et al. concludes that topical muprocin is safe and effective for the treatmentof superficial skin infections due to its low astringent content. Although there are some side effects, both treatments have little or no cross resistance with other anti-bacterial agents. The most important finding in this paper is that streptococcus strains can be isolated from imetigo because of their high levels of arousing ASA. Both drugs are well tolerated; however, it is believed that they will cause more side effects than either treatment group does."
23810272,"Concluson concludes that singletons conceived after IVF have no increased risk of abnormal gynecological scars compared to naturally-conceived peers. Conscious of the inequitability of social class differences, conclusive evidence suggests that pregnancy planning, underfertility or assisted reproduction are not detrimental to children's early development. Children from cryopreservation do not have a greater risk of developing nervous system defects than children from spontaneous conception. In contrast, twins from assisted reproduction have similar risk of neurodevelopmental sequelae at age 3 and 5, but their postnatal health is worse than that of controls. The study does not find any negative influence on the child's psychological development during the first three years of life; however, it does suggest that there may be an inequality between the social class and the gender of the parents involved."
16087812,"In this chapter, Anderson focuses on the effects of physical exercise on heart disease. He concludes that ""low-dose"" n-3 PFAs seem to have an antiarthrotic effect on death and morbidity in patients who are not smoking. However, it is important to note that some studies have failed to show any significant benefit from physical exercise. For example, one study found that men with a higher body mass index had a lower risk of sudden death than those without such a high body mass. This suggests that there may be a need for further investigation into the relationship between body mass and mortality. The Mediterranean diet has been shown to reduce both short-term and long- term mortality. Consuming more fruits and vegetables can also reduce blood pressure and total mortality. Furthermore, consumption of refined grain cereals does not appear to have any beneficial effect on overall mortality. A healthy diet seems to have protective effects on longer-term survival."
29058055,"In this paper, Tukey focuses on the effects of different approaches on dentine strength: 1) using Gse as a scaffold to strengthen root caries; 2) using fluoride as an anti-damineralizing agent; and 3) using collagen crosslinkers. The results show that all three approaches lead to improved dentin strength in the presence of either one or both of these agents."
24049046,"In this paper, we summarize the efficacy of three different morphine-based sedatives for treating patients with mental illness. The first is midazolum, which has a shorter time to start sedation but a longer time to agitate than either haloperidorl or alprazepam; the other two drugs seem to be equally effective in controlling acute agitated behavior. We conclude that both treatments are safe and highly efficacious. Acute agitation due to mental illness may require urgent hypnotic treatment."
24405725,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the relationship between psychological and physical factors in patients with knee pain. It concludes by stating that there is no evidence of an association between psychological or physical factors, specifically depression, anxiety, or poor mental health, to predict future pain."
23587198,"In this study, the authors conclude that a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrate can lead to modest weight loss over two years. They suggest that an ""electrified-world"" setting should be used as a reference for a lower-carbogeneic, high-pillow diet. The results of the trial indicate that replacing some dietary carbohydrates with protein in an ""adlibitum Fat-Reduced Diet"" improves both weight loss and risk factors. Both diets have significant effects on blood pressure, body composition, and other risk factors; however, they are not associated with improved long-term weight loss."
29713547,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to treating patients with low-grade left and unrepaired left vampiose by using a new technique called ""Cdu"" which uses an electrode to track blood flow. They conclude that this new technique is more effective than open or laparoscopic surgery in terms of improving sperm counts, motility, and pregnancy rates. They also discuss the use of light Doppler ultrasound as a tool for determining the degree of defect in men with low grade left varicele. The results of this study suggest that it may be possible to improve testicular functions through treatment of these defects."
27487986,"In this paper, we describe the effect of a high-Glycemic-load breakfast on learning and school performance. We examine the association between the omega-3 Index and the scores on the Longituality Dissipation test and find that those with higher levels of the index are less impulsive than those with lower levels. Furthermore, these results suggest that eating a low-GI breakfast can help to improve brain function."
29445867,"In this paper, the authors present a randomized, febbering-controlled trial of a combination of neuroregulatory and stimulant treatment for patients with mild-to-mid-thirsty ADHD. They conclude that both treatments are highly efficacious in treating children with moderate to severe symptoms. However, their results do not satisfy the need for further research into whether or not they can be used as part of an extended-spectrum treatment regimen."
28025174,"This paper focuses on the effects of physical activity on health in older adults, particularly those with high-risk pregnancies. It concludes that physical activity can be an effective strategy for preventing and reducing the risk of death from adolescence, but it is not yet clear whether this strategy will work."
24798823,Conclusions This paper focuses on the use of gait speed as an outcome measure in older patients with stroke. It uses a patient-specified cut point for improvement in walking speed to estimate the magnitude of change needed for improved function in older people.
19251060,"In this paper, Waddell discusses the performance of the edi-320 neck pain test in patients with back pain. Conclusions that back pain hinders the test's ability to distinguish between soft and hard discs in the cervical spine disease. He uses the Canadian Neck Spine Rule a decision rule to reduce the frequency of use of craniol spine exams in traumatized patients. The results suggest that whiplash injuries can lead to internal disc disturbances which can induce axial and paternal symptoms. Although magnetic resonance is more sensitive than conventional x-rays, it cannot be used to diagnose fractures or dislocated discs because of the low sensitivity of the technique. A simple decision tool based on ""clinical criteria"" can help physicians identify reliable patients who need an examination of the neck after blunt trauma"
25001582,"The results of this study indicate that patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease have a lower risk of returning to work than those without the disease. In contrast, patients with severe disease do not seem to suffer any social or professional disadvantages."
25620754,"In this paper, the effects of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet on body weight and blood pressure are examined. The results suggest that a reduced-fiat diet can be used as a preventative measure against Type 2 diabetes. Although it is not possible to predict the long-term effects of such a diet, we conclude that it may be useful for people with Type 2 who suffer from elevated blood pressure."
15654706,"The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of morphine-based analgesis in patients with severe agitation and to determine whether it is safe and effective. This work will involve the involvement of several health care professionals from Rio, who will be involved in the trial. Conclusions There are many different approaches to treating agitated people, but there is little scientific evidence for either treatment. In particular, no single drug has been able to treat all forms of mental illness. Acute agitations often occur as a result of a long-lived disease. These patients need rapid medical attention and should be treated immediately. Promethazine can be used as an antipsychotic since it does not cause any side effects."
31167038,"In this paper, Bulpitt discusses the results of a recent study in which blood pressure reduction was shown to be an effective strategy for preventing strokes in elderly patients. He concludes that it is not necessarily due to the effect of drugs on blood pressure but rather because they are more effective at reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke. The main aim of the study is to determine whether treatment of 1000 people for one year will reduce strokes by 19 or 9 nonfatal deaths. However, there is little difference in the severity of strokes between the two groupings. For example, among older patients with low blood pressure, a large range of body weight was associated with high risk of fatalities and strokes. This conclusion supports the need for a multi-national trial in elderly subjects with ISH. Older patients and women underwent less intense cardiovascular intervention than younger patients when they were developing CHD; however, these patients did not have as many complications as younger patients. These patients also had lower blood pressures than those who received either diuretics, beta blockers, or other antihypertinels. Both groups showed no significant differences in the rate of death or stroke events. A full scale study has begun"
29064384,"Conclusions In this paper, we present the first evidence for a relationship between weight gain and menarche at age 4 years. We conclude that earlier age is associated with an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in women. This association seems to be primarily due to increased body fat."
27178217,"The results of this study suggest that a low-dose of vitamin D may not be sufficient to prevent acute rheumatia in Mongolian children. Conclusions: Insufficient supply of the essential thief is associated with an increased risk of recurrent pneumonia in young children. A single daily dose of high-dose, long-term IVD can reduce the risk of repeat bouts of pneumonia in younger children."
30006369,"The results of this study suggest that food enriched with various vegetable oils can increase the content of long- chain polyunstained fatty acids, which may be beneficial in atheroscomatose patients. In contrast, coconut oil has no significant effect on bloodlipids. Furthermore, consumption of coconut oil reduces body fat and improves blood pressure. This suggests that EVoo should be included in energy-restrained diets for weight loss."
18058281,"This paper focuses on the effects of light therapy on patients with seasonal depression. It is shown that there are differences in the frequency of remission and severity of response between the three groups of patients with depressed moods. For example, winter depression was more frequently observed in the former group in January and March than in the other two groups. In addition, sleep recording showed improved health-related performance in terms of abilities to work. Furthermore, bright light had an antidepressive effect as well as a beneficial effect on quality of life. The authors conclude that it is important to distinguish between seasons and depression because they relate to different biological factors. They suggest that short-term light therapy can be used as an effective treatment for both types of depression. However, these studies do not provide any specific information about the efficacy or safety of either treatment."
24266676,"Back pain is a very common problem in the United States, and there are many different types of treatment available to treat it. The most commonly used treatment for back pain is spinal cord stimulation. Although this is an effective treatment, it does not lead to significant improvements in patients who receive it."
28826406,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to selecting older patients at risk for gastric-cancer surgery. They use a patient's age as a predictor of long-term survival and post-survival outcomes. The results suggest that frailtiness may be an independent riskfactor for overall survival but not for disease-free outcome in older patients who undergo rhombotomies."
28938794,"Conclusions In this study, diverting cholesterol-lowering ingredients into the same  diet increased the efficacy of diet in treating hypercholestrerolemia. A gluten free vegan diet in red meat deprives mammabinuric subjects of their elevated blood pressure and reduces the Umarr. Both diets reduced body weight but did not increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. The results suggest that both diets may be useful for treating migraines but further research is needed to confirm these conclusions."
25636220,"In this study, Wu and colleagues report that consumption of mlcts can lead to significant reductions in body weight, body fat, blood TG, and total cholesterol in men with hypotriglycemic disease. They conclude that the daily consumption of MLCts may be more effective at reducing body weight than LCTs because it increases energy expenditure and ""fat oxidation"" as well as improves blood lipid levels. However, there are no significant differences between the genders in these two groups. The main conclusion is that consumeting MCTs could result in reduced body weight and increased body fat under an appropriate diet. Consumption also leads to greater loss of overall body weight; however, other serum values did not differ between the two groups during the study. For example, subjects in the MLCT group showed a greater increase in total lipoprotein-cholestrol concentrations when compared to those in the LTT group. Furthermore, coconut oil seems to reduce body weight but does not cause hyperlipidemia. These conclusions suggest that the use of MCT might have a beneficial effect on weight loss in overweight subjects."
22006128,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights et al. compares the performance of two bonding agents: 1) a resin-based glass polymer cement and 2) a ""reinforcement"" glass iomer cement. The results suggest that the latter can provide sufficient bond strength for long-term treatment. However, there are more bond failures when used on wet enamel than when it is used on moist teeth. Both materials fail at the enamel or analyzed surfaces. They do not cause any enamel damage; however, their failures are higher in the posterior and anterior segments. These results indicate that they may be suitable for use as direct bonding to orthodontic braces."
29240976,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of two different antiplatelet regimens. The first is an eight-week regimen that uses aspirin as an adjudicator for patients with acute atherosis. The second is a six-month regimen that does not increase risk of death or major bleeding in patients who have received drugeluting scaffolds. This study also shows that it is more effective to use aspidin alone than to use both drugs. It concludes that although there is no evidence of benefit from simvastapin in this setting, further studies should be performed."
31172295,"The results of this study suggest that a high-fiber, low-fat diet can not only reduce atherogenic weight but also improve blood pressure. In addition, the rec diet has a lower circulating factor VII and an increased fibrinolysis activity. These results suggest that there may be a beneficial effect on Type 2 diabetes in individuals with a low fat, high fiber diet."
18489673,"This paper discusses the use of a newer, more sensitive method for detection of deletion in breast cancer, as well as some of the drawbacks that may arise from this newer approach. Conclusions In some women who have a history of breast disease, high anxiety and/or fear of getting a shot may lead to self-examinement rather than avoidant treatment. These results suggest that psychological support can be useful in helping women manage their own breast disease."
27681948,"This paper focuses on the effects of group-based education on self-management in patients with Type 2 diabetes. It concludes that ""literacy-sensitive"" and culturally-tailored approaches can improve blood sugar control among Latinos, but further evidence is needed to support these claims. In this population, the Diabetes Self-Management program does not improve health outcomes at all. However, it does lead to improvements in patient satisfaction with daily living, BMI, and Hba1c. Further studies are needed to determine how best to use the MLP as a primary care intervention."
25966337,"In this paper, we examine the effects of cost-sharing on prescription drug spending in the United States. We find that the proposed Part D increase is associated with a reduction in the use of certain drugs and an increase in the risk of adverse events. Furthermore, we conclude that there are no significant differences in the actual costs of prescription drugs between the two plans. This paper also discusses efforts to improve mental health care by encouraging private companies to offer discounts on certain medicines."
31828538,"Carnitine was found to be superior to placebo in reducing the risk of heart attack and death. In addition, both groups showed significant changes in lipid profile and sonography. Both groups had significant reductions in blood ALT and lipid levels. These results suggest that L-carntine might be useful in treating patients with carnicine deficiencies."
19158550,"This paper discusses the use of opioids in patients with lumbar pain. Although there are no accepted reference standards for the identification of trigger points, it is possible to use this information to aid in the development of new treatment strategies."
23799418,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft uses a case-control approach to examine the association between smoking and post-opportunity in breast surgery. He concludes that smoking is associated with an increase in risk of complications even after minor wounds are treated. The results suggest that patients should avoid smoking during their pre-surgery visit because it may lead to increased risk of infection."
25173808,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of two recent blood pressure studies. The first was published in the New England Journal of Urinary and Pediometrics; the second was reported in the American College of Physicians. This paper is important because it discusses the use of psychological intervention to lower blood pressure in patients with moderate-to-meditative hypertension. It concludes that both thalamidone and amlorodipine are effective at reducing blood pressure within 24 hours. For example, one study showed that a single daily dose of amorous nitedipine reduced blood pressure by as much as three times its expected effect. A second study found no significant difference in blood pressure after 24 hours on either side of the same treatment. Finally, an observational study revealed that there was no association between blood pressure reduction or duration of action of either agent."
27924055,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of an exercise-based intervention to prevent and reduce the risk of stroke in patients who have had a minor or severe stroke. He concludes by stating that it is not possible to increase physical activity for patients with a major stroke because there are no significant differences between the severity of the attack and the control group. However, Anderson concludes that ""electrified and verbal encouragement"" did not lead any improvement in physical activity. The results of further studies are needed to determine whether such an intervention can be used as a preventative measure against future strokes."
32009497,"In this paper, Dr. Rivers discusses the latest developments in the field of uro-fascian treatment for Dupytren's disease and concludes that it is both cost-effective and safe. He also compares the efficacy of two different approaches to treating patients with dupuytrenz disease: 1) surgical fasciectomy; and 2) single-handed wound decapitation. The results of these studies suggest that there is little difference in the outcome after either surgery or Fasciotomy. However, they do not show any differences in the severity of the contracture after either procedure. This suggests that more evidence needs to be taken into account before further study can be made."
23558383,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates the efficacy of a lifestyle-based exercise regimen to improve strength and function in patients with severe heptoid disease. He concludes by stating that it is not possible to predict the exact effect of an exercise regimen on muscle atrophy in humans."
28024721,"Conclusions In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective observational study on head and neck patients with advanced or metastatic breast disease. We conclude that there is little evidence for the association between age and survival after surgery in older patients."
29278423,"In this paper, the authors present a new progressive walking exercise program for patients with persistent claudication. They conclude that it is possible to improve walking performance in patients who are not suffering from intermittent clacudication. A group-medicated behavior intervention can be used to prevent mobility loss and improve functioning at six and twelve month follow-up of patients with chronic pad. The results indicate that a weekly supervised exercise class provides a substantial improvement in patients' symptoms; quality of life; and distance walk compared with guidance alone. Conclusions That home-based training does not improve walking speed but improved walking capacity in people with diabetic and pad diseases. Home-based exercise also improves functional capacity and Quality of Life in patients with acutely ill diabolical disease. These results suggest that physical exercise may have an important role in improving peripheral arterial disease as they relate to reduced blood flow."
30219553,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a pilot study in which we compared the safety of using mechanical bowel preparation before elective surgery for children. We conclude that it is not possible to prevent infection from occurring in children with an elective color-ectal procedure because of the high risk of complications associated with these procedures. However, we do have some general conclusions about the necessity of mechanical bp in children."
22083832,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of a recent study on the efficacy of long-term antimicrobial regimens for postoperative wound infection in adult patients undergoing acute myeloquy. Although there is some disagreement as to when and how these regimens should be used, it is clear that cefamixone is most effective in preventing such infections."
28813123,"In this paper, we present the results of a large-scale, long-term, randomized study of patients with mild and moderately severe hypertension. We find no significant differences between groups for blood pressure reduction but not for mortality or stroke. The main aim of the study is to determine whether angiotensol-II blocker can be used as a preventative measure against Type 2 diabetes. Although there are some side effects, these do not compromise the efficacy of the treatment."
20495984,"Conclusions The use of PPG reduces the risk of neutronic fever in patients treated with chemotherapies, particularly TAC. Neovasta is safe and well tolerated for advanced patients at a dose of 120mg m1 every 21 days. In addition, it has a favorable effect on mood scores in patients with mild-to-moderate disease. Concluusions Aiming to improve patient education about side effects during rebuffing therapy, C-Boost uses a higher biologically active dose than conventional regimens."
21660022,"In this paper, the authors conclude that only three subjects report greater sensitivity during the post-oporate period than at the time of the previous study. They also find no significant difference in sensitivity between the two Cavalin lining materials at any postoperative interval. The subjects receive Copalite and Vivasens for all assessment times points, 24 hours, one week, and one month post treatment. This results in a significant reduction in patients' sensitivity when compared to those who received conventional liners or bases."
24729336,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effects of vitamin D and caiusculol on hip bone loss in elderly women. They conclude that it is safe to take daily or weekly doses of 1,25-OHD as long as one's health is not compromised. The results suggest that combination therapy with Hormone Replacement Therapy/Estrogen Replacement therapy and Caiusulol increases bone mineral Density significantly more in older women with high bone turnover Osteoporoseis. Conclusions: All three interventions offer long term feasibility for increasing bone mass in healthy post menopausally women. For example, an annual dosage of 100-micrograms 1,75-OH2D3 does not prevent fractures in older people who are living in community care. However, these studies do not support the notion that an annual dose of 1,000-IU of alfacalcol can prevent osteoporiotic fractures among older adults living in institution care."
32028975,"This paper concludes that the ""real-life"" physical activity program for child care centers is not sufficient to increase physical activity in children from birth to age 18 months. Conclusions and Roules The results of this study suggest that early childhood experiences of physical activity are important for shaping healthy movement behavior long-term."
27714911,"This paper focuses on the efficacy of an after school team-soccer program to improve weight control in overweight children. It concludes that this program is highly effective and can be used as a preventative measure against childhood obesity. In addition, it shows that playing football can have significant health effects on both physical and mental health."
12519557,"In this paper, we describe the efficacy and safety of two different anti-hysteria drugs, nitedipine/caprolactin and dalazine. It is concluded that both are safe and effective for the treatment of mild to moderately severe hypertension as a result of pregnancy. We also discuss the use of vasodone in patients with acute preeclam paternal hypertension. Urpidil seems to be more effective than dihydralzine at reducing blood pressure in these patients without serious side effects. Attensive anaesthesia reduces sympathetic hyperactivity but does not cause excessive hypotension. Both drugs improve the platelet counts in the probenecid group. They also do not have any adverse effects on the infants when they are treated with either drug. The introduction of alpraxine into pregnant women reduces the risk of sudden ventricular arthropisms. This study concludes that both drugs are equally effective in the initial management of severe epileptic crises. However, there are some rare side effects due to their use."
30211331,"A randomized, controlled trial of a combination of parent-child and child-in-carrying education for children with moderate-to-senile autism is presented. In particular, the study suggests that early intervention can be used to reduce the severity of an individual's condition."
30865287,"In this paper, the authors present a cost-effective approach to treating infants with cow's milk allergy. Their results suggest that probiotic treatment may be an effective strategy for relieving colic symptoms in early-infancy infants. They conclude by comparing the safety and efficacy of two commonly used prebiotics -- Lactobacilus reutei DSM 18038 and Bifidinobacterium Streptococci -- in terms of their ability to prevent or reduce crying episodes in prematurely bred infants who are experiencing colic."
31646739,"This paper focuses on the effects of a school-based exercise program on physical activity in young adults. Although there is some evidence that this program works, it is not clear whether it will work for all age groups. For example, girls who are physically active are more likely to be less fat at age 7 and 11 than boys who aren't physically active. In addition, studies have shown that physical activity can lead to changes in body composition over time."
28060453,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft demonstrates that an additional twelve-week course of bupropion can be used to produce relatively low incremental costs in the range of life-saving medical treatments. This treatment is more cost-effective when compared to bupropin because it involves multiple quit attempts and lowers the initial cost for each patient. The results suggest that subsiding smoking cessations should be considered from a ""resource-allocution perspective"" rather than as a stand-alone intervention."
23417577,"A shortened four-week supervised pr program is equivalent to an 7-week and 6-month supervised PR program. The results indicate that patients with severe chronic lung disease respond well to the short-term treatment of a shortened version of the training program. Conclusions In this study, confounding evidence from other studies suggests that patient education, self-care skills, and follow up are not sufficient to improve health status or quality of life among patients with mild to moderate chronic disease."
31527625,"In this single-blind, rat-controlled trial, Vildagluptin is superior to metformin for reducing blood glucose in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Both drugs have significant effects on glycerics, but neither reduces the risk of severe complications from type 2 disease."
27163747,This paper focuses on the use of activity-retrieval devices in patients with Type I and Type II Type I melodramatic diseases. It uses wearable accelerometers to track changes in body composition and free-living measures of energy expenditure.
29596650,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effects of two different types of idine-fortifications -- selenium or iron -- on children's health. They conclude that both are effective at reducing the risk of anemia in school-aged children and that they do not find any evidence for increasing Selenium to benefit T(4) to T(3) conversion in elderly women. These results suggest that Selenium may protect against Goiter, but it does not seem to affect thyroid function in pregnant women. This suggests that there is no need for further studies on how these three nutrients relate to each other."
31993718,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to improving care for older women with fractures. They use a case-control study to examine the effect of a single patient-centered intervention on risk of fracture in older women and conclude that it may be possible to reduce hip fractures among older women without using active intervention strategies. The aim of the study is to develop an evidence-based program to improve care for patients with fragile fractures who are at least moderately at risk. A multicomponent intervention designed to increase bone mineral density testing was found to be most effective in three practice groups: 1) primary care physicians; 2) pharmacists; and 3) nursing home patients. Both approaches significantly improved the frequency of bone densitometrism testing but did not lead to improvement in the rate of fractures or falls. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the control group and the intervention group in terms of knowledge, susceptibility, or ability to perform preventive measures. Finally, they concluded that ""patient-centered care"" could be an effective strategy to improve post-femoral fracture management."
24236629,"Conclusions The results of this study suggest that rate control may be an acceptable strategy for patients with thrombopathies. However, it is not recommended in these patients because they have a higher risk of developing permanent atrial fillation. In contrast, rate control seems to be more effective in preventing the reoccurrence of permanent atrium fillations than in controlling the severity of the patient's condition."
16764546,"This paper focuses on the reliability of the physical examinations used to classify low back pain patients. It concludes that the multidimension Index, which uses four dimensions, is highly reliable and can be used as an outcome measure for patients with chronic back pain. Three out of four new therapists who have been trained in this system show moderate reliability when compared to those who have not been trained. However, there are significant differences between the two sets of assessment methods. The McKenzie test has been used since 1832 to categorize patients with lower back pain into different sub-specialties."
22899657,"The pregnancy rate in the second look group is similar to that of the expectant management group. Conclusions are made regarding the efficacy of a modified Cesarean Delivery technique, including Joel Cohen incision and exteriorized full-thick suturing; these results suggest that laparoscopic delivery may be less complicationous than conventional open surgery. In addition, this technique reduces the risk of ovulsion formation. Laparotomies can significantly reduce post-operative wound complications without altering the patient's overall outcome."
21342080,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the safety and tolerability of escitalopram as an antipsychotic for patients with severe panic disorder. Conclusions that sertraline is more effective in treating panic disorder than re boxetine, but no differences are found for anxiety or avoidance. A greater effect of mirtzapine on panic attacks was found; however, no differences were found for weight gain, nausea, paresthesia, and other side effects. Re Boxetine seems to be efficacious in treatment of ssri-refatory panic disorder, but study limitation must be considered"
19300236,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the efficacy of single-dose antimicillin for preventing post-opportune wound infection in patients who have open fractures. He concludes by stating that "" Gram-positive"" and ""noble"" bacteria are common in wound infections and that ""long acting broadspectrum antibiotics"" reduce the risk of severe wound infection by about 0.5 percent."
16009415,"The aim of this paper is to review the efficacy of two different types of restorative materials in the treatment of Class V lesions. Restoratives are used for the first time in this study and demonstrate good clinical performance. For clearfil liner bond 2v, bonding strength increases significantly as the thicker bonding layer increases. However, the single bond decreases significantly with increasing thickness of the bondsing layer. No significant difference is observed in retention of the restored dentin at six months versus 12 months. In addition, there is no significant difference in the color match between the three-year-old restorations. Both adhesives provide excellent retention rates over the 18- month standard set by the A.D.A."
28089943,"In this study, we report that decafenated glucose is not associated with changes in body weight, BMI, or wc. Furthermore, it does not alter energy consumption or mean-hormone concentrations in women over 12 months. We conclude that GTE may be an effective treatment for Type 2DM because it reduces fasting blood concentrations and improves insulin concentrations. This suggests that the high activity form of the carbohydrate-methaphosphoenzyme enzyme may be related to elevations in Insulin and reduction in Adipokines over time."
23079882,"Conclusions This paper discusses the advantages and drawbacks of using a small, postero-lateral incision for total hip replacement. Although it does not offer significant advantages in terms of short-term outcome, it does demonstrate that using fewer conventional instruments can be used to achieve similar results. In particular, this study shows that patients who undergo a minimally resurfacing with an anterior approach are less prone to scarring than those who undergo a standard procedure. Furthermore, there is no difference in blood loss between groups at one and two years post-opportunity."
22907934,"This paper focuses on the effects of a school-based smoking ban on overweight and obesity among children in six to 10 years old. In addition, it suggests that worksite intervention with either SRT or APE may be more effective at preventing young people from smoking. It concludes that ""school-based intervention"" can reduce the frequency of overweight and childhood obesity by improving physical activity and health for students even in socially deserving areas. However, there is no clear evidence that this type of intervention has any significant effect on risk factors such as cardiovascular disease or metabolic syndrome. The results suggest an early public smoking ban might help youth maintain a resolve not to smoke. Conclusions There is no concluding evidence that a thorough smoking ban, harsh penalties, remedial punishments, harm reduction policy or absolute policy impact on all of the smoking outcome. Consumption of lower-fat snacks also appears to be associated with reduced energy consumption."
27827899,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the most recent evidence on the use of sugars in the treatment of Type 2 and other chronic diseases. We conclude by stating that consumption of moderate amounts of sweeteners is associated with an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Consuming too much can lead to significant changes in body weight, lipids, and blood lipid profiles. Furthermore, excessive consumption of refined sugars may increase the risk of developing type 2 or other forms of disease."
30864143,"Conclusions In this paper, Anderson focuses on the importance of physical activity and exercise for improving health in young children. He discusses some of the recent literature on the relationship between physical fitness and childhood obesity. He concludes by stating that future studies will need to focus on more physically active people because they are more likely to be at higher risk of developing heart disease than those who do not participate in regular physical activity."
32161987,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effects of routine pre-operative fluid therapy on pancreatic disease. They conclude that there is no statistically significant difference in the severity of fistulae with or without prophylactic postosteotide. However, they note that chewing gum has been shown to reduce the risk of complications after open pancreatical surgery. Furthermore, their study does not find any association between short-term complications and long term survival. A simple 10-point Fistula Risk Score was used to predict whether patients would develop cynically persistent postoperative fever. The results suggest that early oral feeding may be an effective strategy for preventing syphilis from developing during paternal tuberculosis."
29309534,"In this chapter, we discuss the effects of resistance training on leg power, muscle mass, and power in elderly adults. We conclude that resistance training is superior to other forms of exercise for improving these outcomes because it emphasizes speed of movement rather than focusing on endurance. This paper also discusses the use of heavy loads during resistance training as an effective strategy to improve balance recovery in frail older adults. A recent study suggests that a combination of progressive exercise and nutritional supplements can be used to improve body composition and muscles in aged people. The results are mixed: patients with nutrient-rich diets show greater improvements in their muscle power and strength than those with a placebo-supplemented diet. However, there is no significant difference in functional performance between the two groups."
25754299,"This paper discusses the effects of a weight-control intervention on overweight and obese women. It uses a mixed-race model to examine the association between weight teasing and disordered behavior in young women. The results suggest that weight control can be beneficial for both men and women, but that dieting to lose weight is not always effective. In addition, there are other risk factors associated with weight gain, such as hunger and lack of physical activity. Furthermore, these risk factors may lead to poorer health later in life."
23334071,"This study focuses on the effects of a low dose of pyrophoric penicillin on patients with depression. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to treating depression by using a combination of morphine-serotonin analogy and molecular mechanics to examine the antidepressants in depressed patients. We find that both men and women show rapid antidepressiveant responses after sterile penicillin, but only women show greater response."
24082040,"The effects of the two different contraceptive pills, NGM/E and Meliane, are described in this chapter. Although they do not show significant changes in lipids or lipoprotein concentrations, both pills seem to have an equal effect on these same endpoints. Conclusions In contrast with the LNG-EE OCP, which significantly decreases skin lesions without any significant increase in weight, neither pill does anything to improve sexual desire. Both preparations reduce circulating androgen levels; however, there were no differences in alopeciation after 3 -4 cycles. There was little difference in free T between the two regimens. However, large studies are underway to determine which of the three-generation ointment regimens is most likely to be the best and least rogenic for women."
28370209,This paper focuses on the use of an open-suction technique to measure salivary flow in elderly patients. The results suggest that the technique is acceptable and can be used as an aid in the early detection of macular lesions. It also suggests that the device may be useful in the later treatment of frail older adults.
25359356,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates that the six-minute walk test is accurate and reliable in predicting exercise capacity for patients with moderate-to-severe chronic disease. He uses a cross-over trial to assess the effect of different track layouts on walking distance. The results suggest that ground walking improves endurance walking capacity as well as cycle training. Both groups improve their performance after a period of rehabilitative therapy. A rolling walker reduces fatigue and breathlessness while improving walking performance in patients who are depressed by lung disease. Walking tests can predict survival in patients with mild to severe obstrumental disease."
25459568,"The results of this study suggest that crowns fabricated with CFRC material are not as good as conventionally wrought precious-alloy posts. In addition, the use of composite resin and glass fiber post technology does not result in as good a long-term performance as other tooth-retention methods."
26342482,"Pre-surgery weight loss was not associated with improved surgical safety or weight loss outcomes. However, the results of this study suggest that early dietary counseling may be an effective strategy for improving weight loss after laparoscopic Gastric Bypass. This paper concludes that pre-operative weight loss does not lead to significant improvements in weight loss over the long term; however, it does lead to improvements in physical and mental health during the initial period of follow-up. In addition, there is no evidence that psychological support before and after surgery can improve weight loss."
23885775,"In this paper, Wu uses a case-control study to examine the association between work stress, manual lifting, and low back pain in nursing wards. The authors conclude that an appropriate exercise program can be used to reduce back pain for both nurses and patients. Back pain is particularly common among nurses because of the high risk of injury from heavy lifting. However, studies have found no association between specific manual tasks and back pain."
30422266,"Four patients with pronounced central nervous system ailment withdraw from the treatment group due to an unexplained increase in pain. Although nabilione appears to have some anti-hypervalgesic effects, there is no evidence for cannabidiol's efficacy in treating multiple sclero-induced pain. There are contradictory results on safety of cannanbinoids for any kind of chronic pain. The most significant effect was seen after smoking iv or pulmonally. Both drugs reduced pain but did not lead to changes in subjective pain scores. These results suggest that there may be a modest amount of analgesis for smoked pot."
25427435,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of our previous studies. We agree with the roles of gut associated sphingomied tissue in pathogenesis and do not totally exempt Klebsyella pneumoniae from the development of ass. Although there were mild side effects, it is concluded that sulfatasalzine is safe and effective in the treatment for ankylosizing sponditis. A significant decrease in daily dose of anti-inflammimab was observed; also, in group Si a, a significant decrease of blood levels of IgG was observed. This effect was morepronounced in patients with peripheral joints than in those with spinal symptoms. The efficacy of silfaslazine seems to be limited because of the potential for adverse effects."
22506694,"In this paper, Dr. Manette focuses on the use of the Physician's evaluation scale as a tool for assessing the efficacy of sitting in different types of chairs. It is important to note that there are some differences in the scores of patients using the assessment scale from one manufacturer to another. The authors conclude that siting in a chair with a ""micro-rotation"" function does not lead to significant changes in back pain."
30631593,"In this paper, we examine the effects of a weight loss and physical activity intervention on overweight workers at worksites. We conclude that there is no additional benefit to the program in terms of cost savings or improved health, but that it does improve body mass by reducing food and energy exposures. Although one year's follow-up did not occur, long-term patterns suggest that these worksites were healthier than three years after the intervention. This suggests that an integrated approach may be effective in preventing weight gain among overweight female employees. The results support the office as an efficient avenue for weight loss within overweight females."""
22090798,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effects of acute doses of DCS on patients with an agoraphobic disorder. They conclude that ""a lack of stimulus of the Hpa system at repeated confronting the phobotic situation was associated to therapeutic outcome."" The results suggest that there is little difference in the treatment efficacy between the two different types of panic disorder; however, they do suggest that some degree of prosphylacticefficacy exists beyond the one-year period of imipraminine treatment. This study also suggests that gabapanentin may be effective in more severe ill patients who have panic disorder. Although no deaths were reported, these studies suggest that Gabaptenin may have antidepressant effects in less severely illpatients with panic disorder than re boxetine. Conclusions These reports confirm that inosol is a potential attractive therapy for panic disorder because it has few side effects and does not cause significant side effects."
26567234,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft outlines the evidence for the use of nurse-led preventive care to improve patients' health and reduce their hospitalizations. Nurse-led practices are more effective than general practice in preventing heart disease because they involve nurses who can better understand the patient's condition and be able to relate it to treatment. Wolstonecraft concludes by stating that ""nurse-led prevention"" is an effective strategy for reducing the risk of sudden death in patients with severe congenital heart disease. The results suggest that such a program may be more cost effective than regular primary care."
27871122,"In this chapter, Conclusions discusses the advantages and drawbacks of various approaches for treating asymptomatic atrial fibrillation. The most successful approach is to use a balloonoon as a second-line therapy for patients with long-term AF. Although it does not improve their symptoms or quality of life, it does lead to some improvement in other measures of well-being."
27834223,"In this first large-scale experiment, we examine the effects of social capital on health in a cross-section of European countries. We find that there is a fixed effect between socialcapital and better health across different levels of society. For example, people with higher social connections tend to have lower depression than those with lower social connections. This suggests that social capital can be used as a preventative measure for older people's health."
24188134,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to treating benign prostatichyperplasia by using a dose-escallation strategy. They conclude that it is possible to increase the dose from 50 to 75 millig/day in patients with no improvement in their symptoms after 12 weeks of treatment. Their results suggest that an immediate increase to 75mg/d day may be useful for patients with mild BPH who have not improved at 50mg per day. Furthermore, they conclude that alpha1A and alpha2-blockers are more efficacious than either of these drugs because they offer a slight degree of evacuatory dysfunction. These results further suggest that ""alpha1B"" selective blockers might be more effective in terms of improving nocturary polyuria. However, there remains unresolved whether or not the safety of such compounds in Japanese is comparable to European men's."
19888792,"The results of this study suggest that stenting can be more cost effective than bypass surgery for patients with multiplevessel disease. In addition, it reduces hospitalization time and costs. Furthermore, the patient returns to work in only 10 days. Cost-effectiveness is not limited by the severity of the disease; however, there are significant differences between the two groups. Conclusions That early identification of lowrisk patients with mimmis allows safe omissment of the intense care phase and anaesthesia testing, which leads to substantial savings. Although at one year follow up there were no major in-patient complications between patientstreated with Coronary Angioplasty or Coronary Stenting, patients treated with these two strategies had greater freedom from angiograms, reinterventions, and combined events as compared to those treated with either intervention. This educational model reinforces the value of maternal education as essential part of diabetics care"
27233078,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the long-term effects of weight loss and surgical intervention on patients with Type 2 diabetes. He concludes that surgery is more effective than conventional therapy in terms of improved glucose control and reduced body weight. However, there are still some unresolved concerns about the safety and efficacy of these newer treatment approaches."
15626993,"Back pain is a very common cause of back pain in the U.S., and many patients have been treated for it. However, this does not predict whether they will get better or not. This paper discusses some of the latest developments in the field of lowback pain management. For example, there has been an increase in the frequency of visits by chiropractors to improve patient outcomes. A recent study suggests that chiropractic care may be more effective in relieving back pain than other forms of treatment. In addition, these studies suggest that physicians should be more frequently visited by their patients when dealing with back pain."
22160462,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of case-management to improve the treatment of patients with fractures. He concludes that an active role by surgeons can increase the rate of appropriate treatment for patients who have a fracture. This intervention is especially important because it reduces the risk of further fractures and increases the expected life expectancy of the patient. Anderson also discusses the importance of early detection of hip fractures in order to prevent future fractures from occurring. The results suggest that earlier intervention should be considered when there is a high risk of another fracture. A patient-specific approach to postfracture care improved bone mineral density measurements and increased the proportion of patients being investigated for Ostoprasis. However, no significant effect was seen on treatment rates as well as improvements in uptake of BMD testing."
23539309,"A supervised walking program is effective in improving exercise performance in people with intermittent padicis. In contrast, strength training does not improve walking performance. The only measure of improvement in the quality of life after six months of exercise training is the ability to walk at a given distance. Conclusions A weekly supervised exercise class provides a substantial improvement in patients' symptoms, quality-of-life, and distance traveled compared with guidance alone. This improvement continues after attending classes has been stopped. Conscious of the need for further evidence on the effectiveness of home-based exercises as an exercise regimen for persons with intermittent caudication, this study concludes that a ""home-based"" exercise program is superior to a more frequent daily exercise regimen."
31115827,"This paper focuses on the effects of worksite exercise on cardiovascular health. It concludes that worksite exercises seem to improve both physical and mental health, but there is some evidence that they may also lead to increased risk of heart disease."
24953955,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights concludes that 0.5-mg. 1,25-OH2D/day is not sufficient to improve bone mineral density in older people. He also discusses the use of combination therapy with estrogen replacement therapy and alfacalcol for improving bone mineral dentition in elderly women. The results do not seem to reduce blood pressure or develop hypertension over seven years of follow up. Conclusions Improving Calcium and Vitamin D nutritional status considerably reduces risk of breast cancer; further studies are needed to determine whether these agents might affect risk for other diseases."
29941852,"In this single-blind, rat-controlled study, Lise concludes that there is no significant effect of pre-opportunity for carbohydrate in the treatment of patients undergoing total hiparthroplasty after elective surgery. The major mechanism of resistance was an inhibiting of Insulin-induced Nonoxidative Gas Disposition after surgery. Both groups had better preservation of their respective insulin sensitivity and improved glucose dissorption in peripheral tissues. However, both groups failed to show any beneficial effects on postoperative complications or body composition. Acerto's multimodal approach to peri-and-postoperative care appears to reduce LOS and Post-Operative Complications in older adults who undergo total knee replacement."
30684171,"This paper focuses on the effect of laparoscopic rybb on blood glucose levels in post-obstructive liposis. It shows that both procedures lead to improved weight loss and improved quality of life after 7 years. In addition, it suggests that early weight regain is not related to changes in insulinsensitivity. However, there are other possible reasons for this change: increased nutrient absorption from the hind gut can alter the body's response to hunger."
19091760,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the use of fluoxeonine as an anti-arthritin agent in patients with chronic obstructive rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, we demonstrate that boswellian serrata can be used as a local analgesic against recurrent acute myelogia. We conclude that it is safe and efficacious for the treatment of osteoarthrits of the knee."
29857555,"The narrator gives several reasons for why breast milk should be given to extremely low-birth weight infants. First, it's important to know that the incidence of infection and other complications in preterm babies is significantly reduced when they are fed exclusively human milk. Second, there's a significant increase in the rate of surgical necrotism in infants treated with exclusive formula. Finally, this study confirms that ""breath milk fortifications"" can improve short term growth but don't have any long-term effects on development. Third, changing to an EHm milk diet during 33 weeks reduces the risk of neonatal enterocolation. Fourth, using donor milk as a replacement for mother's milk increases the odds of nosingitis by nearly a quarter. Fifth, increasing the amount of maternal milk per day was associated with reductions in the chance of getting sick in very low birth-women. Sixth, increased doses of Omm feeding were also associated with reducing the chances of getting blood poisoning in prematurely feigned miscarriages. These results suggest that high-dose feeding might be an inexpensive strategy to help prevent these costly mor"
26489667,"The results of this large-scale, randomized controlled trial suggest that there is no significant difference in the lipid profiles between the Lgi diet and the ""HNR-based"" diet. However, both diets have an equal effect on blood lipid profile. A negative relationship between fat and protein appears to be seen among obese individuals with higher glyceric load. This study furthermore suggests that reduced-calorie regimens may be an effective strategy for weight loss in overweight children."
26244049,"In this paper, the effects of zinc and mixed-intake morphine on Type 2 diabetics are summarized. The results indicate that both Zn and Se can be used as preventative measures against malignancies. However, it is necessary to confirm these claims in an independent study before any new public health advice can be made regarding either treatment."
30187176,"This paper presents the results of a large, well-cognized open-label study in which patients with Type 2 diabetes who received either exenatides or placebo had a significant reduction in their risk of heart attack and mortality. The authors conclude that this is an appropriate treatment for type 2 patients because it reduces both the risk of death and hospitalization as well as the severity of the disease. They also suggest that these patients may benefit from lifestyle changes such as weight loss and exercise to improve their health."
30380802,"The results of this study suggest that exercise is an effective intervention for reducing the risk of Type 2 Diabetes in overweight and obessed men and women. In addition, resistance training has a beneficial effect on both body mass and fat mass. This suggests that lifestyle changes can be used to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in patients with high-risk disease."
26167669,"In this first study, Wu demonstrates that long term Xuezehikang therapy is safe and efficacious for the secondary preventive treatment of Chinese patients with previous mild-to-serious malignancies. It also shows that prava statin can be used as an effective antihysteria treatment in patients with mild to moderately elevated blood pressure. Conclusions These results may have implications for future phosphorus-lowering regimens. Conscious of the fact that red yeast rice reduces both total cholesterol and lipoprotein concentrations than placebo, he concludes that ""red yeast rice significantly reduced total cholesterol, LDLcholerol concentrations, and total Triacyl Glycerol levels"" could lead to improved lipid control in general."
21336493,"This paper describes a novel approach to improving the quality of care for elderly patients with gluco-corticois who are at high risk for fractures. It uses a patient-centered, evidence-based approach to develop a treatment regimen that improves bone mineral density and falls risk in older adults."
19228241,"In this study, the effects of a daily exercise program on patients with a stroke are investigated. The control group showed greater improvement than the intervention group in both time and performance during the first six months after stroke. This suggests that an exercise program based on sensory manipulation is more effective in improving arm function than a traditional task-oriented regimen."
30359452,"Conclusions The results of this study indicate that the importance of Time-of-Matriage in prediction of heart failure hospitalization in patients with afib ablation is not yet fully established. However, both methods have good success rates and are associated with lower complication rates. Both groups improve in quality-of life scores after ablation. In addition, both groups show improved safety from atrial thrombosis than before. Concluusions This large, prospective, randomized, controlled study confirms that cryobolon ablation can be used as an effective alternative to conventional antiarrhythm therapy for patients who have persistent atrial fibrillation."
31039170,"In this study, the authors conclude that no significant relationship is found between the changes in serum 25 hydroxyd and age adjusted balance or strength. They also conclude that higher daily doses of 1,500 IU of vitamin D do not improve lower leg function. A sub-study shows that among older women with low levels of 25 OHD, there is a high risk of falls when compared to a daily dose of 2,800 iu. The results suggest that exercise may be an effective way to increase leg power and lift in this population. Both men and women show signs of reduced 25 hd and higher pth levels. However, neither group achieves improved physical performance at the end of the study."
32383066,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the association between drinking coffee and hip fracture risk in women. He concludes that there is little association between coffee-drinking and hip injury in older women because they are more likely to have a negative balance of calcium in their bodies. However, Anderson suggests that consumption of dairy can be a good strategy for preventing hip fracture from occurring among older women. Furthermore, it is not associated with overall mortality or incident fracture in older men."
25209137,"Proton Pump Inhibitors and Osteoporotic Frailty The implication of this paper is that future studies will focus on understanding the mechanism by which proton pump-inhibitors are associated with increased risks of fracture. Although these studies have not yet been published, it is clear that they do not hold much weight in the medical literature."
27810345,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights uses fMRI to investigate the psyches of patients with obstructive sleepwalking. He concludes that hypnotism can be harnessed to improve mood and behavior in patients with severe mental illness. The results suggest that LSD may be an effective treatment for patients with moderate to severe psychological disturbances."
30234085,"This paper focuses on the effects of exercise on working memory in older adults, particularly those who spend most of their time sitting. It concludes that physical activity can be beneficial to both health and well-being because it improves energy and mood. Short bouts of physical activity are associated with reduced risk of developing obesity and Type 2 diabetes among older adults. In addition, studies have suggested that short bouts may be effective for preventing these risk behaviors from occurring later in life."
24129841,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether a ""cognition remediation program"" could be able to improve the treatment of young patients with early-onset mental illness. In this first trial, we found significant improvements in weight gain and body mass at two weeks' follow-up. A double blinded comparison of two different antipsychotic agents for children and teenagers with schizophrenia shows that clozepine is more efficacious than either agent. However, there are few other trials and, presently, there is no conclusive proof regarding the effects on those with early childhood onset disease. There are few further studies but, now, there was little conclusively evidence regarding the effect of antipsychetic medication for those who had early onset sickness. Some benefit was identified in using an atypical Antipsychotic agent compared withhaloperidole but the benefits weren't offset by an increase risk of serious consequences. Larger, more robust trials are needed."
22861822,"In this paper, the first evidence of an acute exercise intervention in smoking is presented. A single session of vigorous exercise reduces cravings for cigarette but does not alter the severity of the individual's response to the cues of smoking. The results suggest that short-term exercise may be more effective than long-term restorative treatment."
26383615,"In this paper, Conclusions discusses the use of the urostomy education scale as an evidence-based tool for patient education. He concludes that it is more effective in preoperative setting than in the conventional setting because it allows patients to be educated earlier in the hospital and has no negative effects on patient health. The results of this study suggest that alivimopan can speed up bowel recovery after radical Cynectomy with shorter time to ileus and less risk of complications. This study also suggests that abstinencing alcoholism reduces postopera morbidity but does not result in any improvement in quality of life."
25370201,This paper focuses on the effects of a school-based physical activity intervention on children's health and suggests that it may be useful as a preventative measure against overweight and childhood obesity. It also discusses the use of hand-held fitness tests to assess movement difficulties in young children.
19160253,"Conclusions The Panic disorder severity scale is a useful measure for assessing severity of panic disorder in patients with an established diagnosis. However, further studies are needed to determine whether the use of self-examiners and ""big-cbt"" therapy can be used to predict worse outcome after long-term treatment. Confused by these results, however, we conclude that there is no significant change in learning, verbal memories or reaction time from baseline to follow-up at six months. In contrast, patient's initial expectations of treatment success were negatively impacted by posttreatment panic anxiety. This suggests that short-term drug treatment does not provide greater protection against relapse when combined with psychotherapies. A double blinded study confirms this finding; it also suggests that some patients with panic disorders have a higher risk of recurrence than those who receive monotherapy. Furthermore, alprasolam causes side effects but many patients are willing to accept them. Cognitive behavior therapy was found to prevent relapsing after drug interruption. Paroxenine and imipramine were particularly useful in the long term management of papulodia. Diazepriam was more effective than al"
18838001,"This paper focuses on the association between work-related physical and psychological risk factors for carpal tunnel disease. It uses a cross sectional study to identify the most important predictors of Cts in this population. In particular, it finds that workers with wrist pain, finger tendonitiis, and hysteria are at greater risk than those without these risk factors."
30463844,"This paper focuses on the effects of sucrose on hyperinsulimmation in patients with Type 2 diabetes. It suggests that some people are susceptible to this disease by consuming too much of it, and that those who show ""sulcrose-inducedhypoinsulinism"" may be better able to manage their disease than those who have no such susceptibility. The results suggest that simple lifestyle changes like adding raisins or walking can improve blood lipid levels but not weight loss. In addition, these studies suggest that reduced consumption of sugar does not lead to significant changes in other important risk factors for heart disease. However, they do suggest that increased consumption of sweeteners is associated with greater increases in fasting and Postpr and Ial Plasma Triacyl Glycerol Concentrations. These results strongly suggest that small amounts of sugar can play a key role in modulating choline and lipoprotein metabolism."
23074516,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft discusses the use of patient-led self-management as a means to improve quality of care for patients with acute and chronic atrial fistbital disease. The results suggest that it is possible to train primary care physicians in how to manage their patients' blood levels of antithrombosis without significant risk of complications. Self-management also appears to be more cost effective than routine care. A comparison between group-based and group-in-control shows that self-managed treatment leads to better control of OAC than conventional regimens. Furthermore, there are no major bleeding events in either group. Both groups report improved patient satisfaction when they do not take warfarin. This suggests that further studies need to be performed to determine whether these new approaches will reduce the risk of severe or fatal bleeding."
30293134,"Conclusions and Relevance The results of this study indicate that the laparoscopic radical gastric bypass is superior to the conventional procedure, Laparotomie. However, there are higher complications in the long- term than in the short-lived Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass. In addition, patients with severe morbid obesity have a higher risk of complications than those who receive traditional surgery. This paper concludes by stating that it is necessary for surgeons to carefully select patients for their treatment of morbid or acutely ill patients. It also discusses the use of an adjustable gastric band as a means of weight loss and improving quality of life after lengthy follow-up studies."
28253049,"In this paper, the results of a five-year follow-up of older adults who fell were compared to their performance on eye-exertion tests and fall risk measures. The results suggest that early detection of falling can be accomplished by better gait control. A six-month music-retrieval program improves gait under double-task condition, improving balance, and reducing both the frequency of falls andthe risk of falling"
28466180,"This paper focuses on the safety and efficacy of two different antimicrobial regimens for preventing post-elective abscesses in women undergoing laparoscopic surgical procedures. It concludes that both regimens are effective in preventing infection following elective abdominal surgery. In particular, it is concluded that cefazin and amoxacin are as effective as short-term prophylactics at preventing minor morbidities after elective caparoscopic hysternectomy."
26498716,"In this paper, Conclusions discusses the benefits and drawbacks of atrial balloon ablation in patients with a myoid heart disease. He concludes that it is superior to conventional methods for maintaining syphilis after two-year follow-up in patients who had ""PVI"" strategy. After four years, however, there is still evidence that PVI plus LL remains superior to standard antiarrhythmical drugs in these patients suffering from paroxysmal atrial fillation. Conclisions furthermore discuss the use of balloons as an alternative to medical therapy for patients with atrial Fib. The results of this study suggest that cathter ablation may be a more cost effective approach than the ADT in treating patients with persistent atrial fever."
26920333,"The results of this study suggest that there is an inverse relationship between blood pressure levels and risk of heart disease in both African Americans and white patients. In addition, it suggests that treatment with amlopril can reduce the risk of stroke by as much as two-thirds. This conclusion supports the need for further studies on blood pressure control in patients with Type 2 diabetes. A recent report concludes that long-term use of enapril or tr prevents major cardiovascular events but does not improve the rate of death from acute myomyocardial arteriosis."
32054469,"Conclusions : This early intervention does not improve neurologic or mental development or grow older in infants birth at 32 weeks. However, there are some indirect evidence that this early intervention may result in improved long-term outcome. In contrast, the Nidcap-based care program has no positive effects on growth or motor or behavior at two years of age and is associated with reduced parental stress."

31858251,"In this paper, the authors present evidence for the use of mirtrazpine in treating patients with depressed symptoms. They conclude that it is possible to use this drug as a treatment for patients with multiple pain-related symptoms, such as insomnia, anxiety, and depression. However, more studies need to be performed to confirm this efficacy."
27889922,"In this paper, Conclusions focuses on the role of positive and negative symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. He concludes by stating that there is little good evidence for use of atypical drugs in treating patients with acute or exacerbed behavior. However, conclusive evidence supports the notion that positive symptoms can lead to aggressive behavior. For example, one patient who had a prior history of severe depression may show better response to antipsychotic therapy than another patient who did not have such a history. Furthermore, some studies suggest that people with a past history of poor response to conventional treatment may benefit from newer treatments. There are few good trials for using benzodiazapines alone; however, most trials were too small to indicate differences in either favorable or negative effects"
25409878,"In this paper, Caius uses the results of a large-scale, long-term observational study to evaluate the efficacy of statins in patients with high-risk pre-disease. He concludes by comparing the costs of both regimens and calculating the impact of each strategy on the overall cost of treatment."

10796569,"In this paper, the effects of a single-blind treatment on two healthy twin pairs are examined. The results suggest that one member of each pair takes a well-matched placebo and the other takes an ascorbicic acid tablet daily for 100 days in order to prevent colds. Both groups experience less severe colds than those taking only a placebo; however, they do not show any biochemical effects. This study also does not support the use of large amounts of vitamin C as a preventive measure against common colds because there is no evidence of serious side effects. A double blinded study was performed among 641 Japanese children over a fourteen-week period to evaluate the effect of high doses of alcibiades on their resistance to infectious disease. Although some studies have shown no benefit or potential harm from these types of treatments, it is necessary to conduct such studies in strict double blind conditions."
26657419,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which patients with Type 2 Diabetes and CHL were treated with two different statins. The first was atorvastastatin; it improved all lipid profiles and PF while the second was more effective at reducing blood glycemic load. Both drugs had beneficial effects on both lipid parameters but did not lead to significant changes in other risk factors. They also showed no differences in the change in lipoprotein concentration during treatment. These results suggest that there is a new mechanism involved in lowering fibrinogen by fibrates"
30350850,"This paper presents the results of a large-scale, randomized, controlled trial on the efficacy of stand-standing and workstation training for workers with neck pain. The results suggest that these measures may be more effective in preventing lower back pain than they are at preventing upper-limb pain among office workers. In addition, the study suggests that ""electronic intervention"" can be used to reduce upper-arm pain caused by desk-workers."
30547275,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates the efficacy of analgesics in patients with moderate-to-mildly active colitis. He concludes that it is possible to induce remission by a single dose of 5-acetyloxane or other anti-inflammatory agent. This study furthermore establishes the reliability and validity of the Workplace &apos;Aid Question Observation Question /WPAI."
31846655,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the relationship between smoking and Type 2 diabetes. He concludes that smoking is associated with an increased risk of developing Type 2 disease in older adults than does other risk factors such as blood pressure and allostatic loading. Furthermore, weight discrimination increases the risk of heart disease by doubles the risk over the next 10 years. This suggests that ""eliminating weight stigma"" may reduce stress-induced changes in body composition and thus improve health for both men and women."
32357844,"This paper focuses on the efficacy of an interdisciplinary approach to stroke care, which involves patient education, group-based intervention, and follow-up. It concludes that this approach is effective in reducing the risk of stroke or recurring events for patients with a severe ischemic disease. In addition, it does not improve blood pressure control over six months after stroke."
20559827,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to hip arthrostomies with a single incision and a posterior approach. They conclude that this approach is superior to conventional approaches because it does not involve an orthopedic table or specific instrumentation; it allows for rapid recovery and early post-opportune rehabilitation. The method of physiologetic intervention was more highly rated than that of non-pharmacological treatments. Conclusions: The method logical quality for apothecary intervention was significantly higher when compared to that for non- pharmacists. There were good agreement among raters on individual item levels and in total peddo scores. However, there was no improvement in the outcome after six weeks. This study shows that the new minimally idylvading approach is safe and can be used as a stand-in-waiting option for patients who have limited access to their surgeons."
31119649,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a single-weekly dose of Mod4023 in Ghd patients. It shows that it is safe and efficacious for long-lasting use as a replacement for daily gh. We conclude that Transcon GH is more potent than daily IGF-1 and can be used as an adjudicator against breast cancer in pregnant women."
21844549,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to treating hip fractures by randomizing 50 patients in order to determine whether or not they should receive an epidural nerve block. They conclude that it is easy and effective; however, their results do not translate into improved rehabilitation. Furthermore, no significant differences were found among high risk patients between Ficb prophylaxes and placebo group in terms of deriving from delirium-induced pain. This study also suggests that using skin traction does not offer any benefits in pain management for the patient."
31598135,"Probiotics and prebiotics are superior to lifestyle intervention in the treatment of non-alcoholicfatty liver disease, especially in patients with a high risk of developing hepatosis. In addition, probiotics can improve gut flora by inhibiting the action of typhoid and enhancing antagonectin, which might result in reducing blood glucose and lipid metabolism in Nald patients. The results of this study suggest that probiotic combination with metformin may be more effective than other treatments for improving liver funciton in patients who have nasal deficiency."
25351783,"This paper presents the first large-scale, cross-sectional study of the association between sitting and weight status in India. It focuses on two main determinants of obesity: 1) physical activity and 2) eating habits. The results suggest that there is a strong association between watching and poor health. In addition, it suggests that physicians should encourage moderate to vigorous physical activity as an intervention for preventing or treating childhood obesity."
25074070,"Almonds reduce the risk of heart disease by reducing both total and LDLcholesterol levels. In addition, they improve blood pressure in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Both diets result in significant weight loss. A low-fat, plant-based diet is more effective in reducing blood pressure than a high-carbohydrate diet."
22923430,"The aim of this paper is to describe the use of walking speed as a measure of function in older adults. Conclusions There are two disadvantages to using walking speed: first, it is difficult to track changes over time; second, there is no way to predict long-term changes in gait or mobility. This paper emphasizes the importance of having a good measure of gait speed and how it can be used to predict future health problems."
26210195,"The results of this study suggest that atorvastain, which is given for 6 months, significantly reduces the risk of heart attack in patients with acute coronary disease. This suggests that gastric bypass may be an effective treatment for type 2 and other adipose-related diseases. In addition, it improves blood lipid profiles in patients who have undergone bariatic surgery."
25359355,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the relationship between the six-minute walk test and the regression analysis that predicts peak work rate for the cycle exercise training in patients with convalescent thrombopathies. He concludes by examining the effect of changing track layout on walking distance. The results suggest that using continuous tracks may increase walking distance more than straight tracks. However, there is little agreement between the two tests. Conclusions furthermore that the 6 minute walk test is superior to the endurance shuttle walk test for detecting change in exercise performance after bronchilation. A rollator can be used as an aid to improve walking performance in people with severe obstrumental disease."
21640547,"This paper focuses on the effects of exercise on men with and without prostatic disease. It concludes that it can be used as an alternative therapy to ADT in patients who have not yet received treatment for their disease. In addition, it is important to note that there are some limitations to the use of age-related information when interpreting results from these studies. For example, one study suggests that an oncoholic recommendation may increase physical activity in newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients; another suggests that this recommendation should be recalled at least one week after receiving it. Finally, the authors present a prospective randomized trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of resistance exercise in patients with low-grade prostatecancer. They conclude that progressive resistance exercise improves muscle strength, functional performance, and balance in men with localized prostitute disease. Prostatecarrying affects health related quality of life, particularly in terms of balance ability. The authors suggest that home-based exercise could improve balance confidence among early stage breastcancer patients. However, they do not yet know how to apply this knowledge to other types of patients."
30698831,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the efficacy of topiramate as a treatment for alcoholism in rats. The subjects were given 300mg per day, and their blood ethanol level was similar to that of placebo. In addition, they showed greater changes in craving than those of other drinkers. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the amount of cannibidiol consumed by the subjects. There was also a reduction in frequency of drops seizures among children with Lennox-Gausaut syndrome. Cannabidial did not have an effect on these patients; however, it had modest effects on irritable behavior."
25995283,"In this paper, Wulliver focuses on the effects of palm-olein and coconut oil on lipophosphorylation. He concludes that ""palmitic acid"" from palm oil might be a good alternative to trans fats from hydrogenated vegetable oils in margarines because it is more favorable than either type of oil. The main problem with these studies is that they do not show any significant differences in blood lipid concentrations between humans and other cooking oils. For example, people who consume palm oil on a daily basis are more likely to get an increased risk of heart attack than those who consume a high-sugar diet. This suggests that replacing palm oil with polyunstained vegetable oil will reduce the risk for heart attack."
28485385,"Conclusions Posttraumatic Stress disorder in patients with spinal cord injury is more common after a long-term stay in the hospital than after an initial episode. This suggests that mental health services, such as early intervention and treatment, may be particularly important for these patients."
23372816,"Conclusions In patients without prior evidence of heart attack, a restrictionive transfusion strategy does not increase the length of stay after total knee and hip replacement surgery. However, confounding results suggest that use of restrictive transfusion strategies may be associated with increased incidence of spontaneously musing wounds. Autologous bleeding transfusion is an effective method to reduce consumption of allogeneically blood and thus, indirectly for cutting all complications related directly to allogenicblood transfusion. The return of wsb in thirh seems to effectively shorten the patient's hospital stay but also reduces post-resurfusion requirements for ankle brachial amputation. Both methods seem to have some positive effect on reduction of ABT in preoperative patients with Hb between 13 and 16 gd/dl. Allogeneic transplants are more cost effective than autologous ones because they do not involve any risk of infection or injury."

28202095,"Conclusions In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, i.e. random, cross-sectional study of patients with mild to moderate schizophrenia. We conclude that folate and vitamin B12 can be used as an adjuvant for treatment of symptoms in patients who have low blood levels of prolactin. Furthermore, taurine appears to improve mental health in patients with early-onset psychosis but is not shown to be particularly effective at treating these patients."
30540028,"In this paper, Conclusions demonstrates the utility of the Brain Scanner as a tool to predict violent attacks in patients with acute mental illness. The results suggest that there are many independent factors associated with aggressive behavior in the Psychiatric-Emergency Service. Conscious of the wide variation in the frequency and severity of these risk factors, it is necessary to create a standard for reporting on these issues."
25636811,"In this paper, we report the results of a double-blind, quackery-controlled study on parathyroid function in patients with dialysis. The results suggest that 1)parathyroid hormone may contribute to abnormalities in blood sugar tolerance and 2)calcitriol might improve pancreatic secretion by improving glucose tolerance in haemolysis patients. We conclude that ""short-term"" calcitario therapy is safe for patients with severe kidney disease but not for long-term treatment."
30557311,"This paper uses a case-control study to examine the effects of sitting in a wheelchair on patients with lumbar spasms. It concludes that there are several risk factors for these conditions, including frequent mechanical exposure and poor patient care. These include long working hours, insufficient selection of an appropriate size of the chair, and high job demands. Furthermore, it is necessary to take psychological factors into account when dealing with work-related problems."
29212370,"This paper focuses on the effects of short-term psychological intervention on patients who are at risk for sudden death from an acute myomyocardial arrhythmia. It concludes that ""Type A behavior"" can be changed by group counseling and that this alteration is better than no group counseling in the secondary preventive treatment of heart disease. In addition, exercise training has a significant reduction in the risk of fatal events when compared to stress management alone. Furthermore, relaxation therapy seems to have a stronger effect on depression than any other form of treatment. Finally, Enrichadd's patient-centered approach reduces the risks of mortality, myocarital infa Rct Ion, and stroke among men and women with low social support prior to coronary surgery."
17138709,"In this study, the authors describe the use of sternous fluorides as an effective antimicrobial agent for the treatment of gingival and plaque. They conclude that they have demonstrated significant reduction in the formation of new tartal lesions when compared with standard fluoride controls. The results support the claim that these two treatments can be used as part of a daily regimen to prevent or delay gum disease. A six-month follow-up study is performed to evaluate the effects of three different types of denticides on the control of both bleeding and soft tissue. These studies demonstrate that the first dentition contains a stable stannousfluoride which significantly reduces the development of newly formed tartle lesions while the second dentitrice contains only a pyrophosphoric ditergent. This study also confirms the earlier claims made about the effectiveness of other dentices such as baking soda and hydrogen peroxide; however, it does not provide any additional evidence against their efficacy."
20881587,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the fall-preventative exercise program for older people in Long-Term Care Facilities. He concludes that there is no significant difference in falls between the two groups and that resistance training does not reduce falls. However, it does improve quality of life in older people who live in long- term care facilities. Both groups show improved functional performance after six months of exercise training. The lower intensity group does not increase physical activity but rather improves balance function. This suggests that strength training can be used to prevent falls in frail old people living in short-term care homes."
26567029,"Conclusions & Inferences A majority of people with feius-dyspotic disease has visceral, chemohypersensitivity that involves TRPV1 pathway. Some subsets of adults have somatic and central sensitized hypersensitivity. Consciousness suggests that there may be some role for anxiety in the pathophysiology of these patients. Levosolpiride is not as effective as other drugs in treating functional dizziness. Itopride does not improve symptoms in patients with fist-disease."
28472417,"Conclusions In the follow-up studies, we find that children in the ICSI group show similar intellectual and motor development at age 8 compared to those in the control group. We conclude that pregnancies do not lead to poorer learning or memory outcomes for children who have been raised in lesbian mother families since birth. Pregnancy does not affect these children's mental health; however, there is a significant gap between the two groups because of social and emotional differences. The results suggest that twins given a propensity for sperm fertilization are at an advantage in language development when compared with spontaneously born twins."
27418884,"This paper presents the results of a single-centre, single-arm study on wrist pain and function after fractures. The outcome is similar between the two groups: De palma method improves early functional outcome in the early post-opportunity period while supination motion favors the fixed-angle technique. Both methods have good evidence for validity, reliability, andresponsiveness. In particular, the PEM has the best evidence for reliability and responsiveness among patients with wrist injuries. However, there is no difference in the patient's subjective satisfaction at six weeks or one year in either group. A comparison of the Dash, MHQ, and Auscan Osteoartis H and Index instrument is needed to confirm that they are reliable and respondable to nerve disorders. Furthermore, the addition of an arthrososcopic intervention leads to better functional outcome than fixation during the early recovery period. Although the improvement at posttest was significant, it was clear that the combination of conventional rehabilitation and mirror therapy produced more improvements in hand and function than the control group. Mirror therapy also improved strength and range of motion in older patients who had distal bridging fractures; however, these results were not as important as the"
31316592,"Conclusions In this paper, the results of a randomized, controlled trial are presented. The aim of the study is to compare the effectiveness of medical exercise therapy and self-management exercises for patients with new shoulder pain who have not received physical therapy in the past three months. Both groups show significant improvements in pain severity and function after one year's follow-up; however, there is no clear difference in pain intensity or function between groups."
31848147,"Consolt-Ealth has the potential of improving reporting and providing a basis to evaluate the validity andapplicability of health trials. This paper concludes by describing how it will be used to report on an intervention for children with autistic spectrum disorder.

23440795,"In patients with Type 2 diabetes, statins seem to be effective at reducing the risk of stroke. However, there is little evidence that they are effective in preventing major heart disease. A recent study suggests that drug trials may draw pro-industry conclusion; however, studies funded by for profit organizations are more likely to report favorable results than those funded by non-profit organizations. This paper also discusses the use of breast awareness as a preventative measure against coronary disease. It concludes that statin therapy is associated with better leg function and lower risk of cardiovascular events in people with type 2 or mildly elevated lipoprotein levels. The main outcome of this study is an assessment of the effect of treatment on various endpoints such as pain free walking distance, community-based activity, blood pressure reduction, and mortality."
30128767,"In this paper, Holmwood systematically examines the effects of a high-fat, low-fiber diet on heart disease risk and suggests that it may be useful for some patients.

It uses a mixed-effects approach to examine the efficacy of meal replacement, physical activity, and body composition measures. In particular, it suggests that meal replacement can be used as an effective weight management strategy in young male soldiers."
21251757,"Back pain is a common cause of leg pain in the U.S., but there are few studies evaluating the efficacy of physical exercise for patients with back pain. In this paper, Wuthering Heights concludes that ""controlPENS"" is more effective than placebo in relieving pain and improving function at six months. A latent class approach is used to identify patients who have returned to normal activity after a long period of time without improvement in pain or function. The results of this study will help to better understand the nature of low back pain in general."
25639643,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the efficacy and drawbacks of ECG-monitoring in stroke patients. They conclude that it is more cost-effective to use 7-d electrodes than 24-h electrodes for detection of atrium fibrillation during an acute stroke. They furthermore suggest that extended cardiac event monitoring should be used in patients with high risk of having a stroke. Conclusions That long-term ECG observation is superior to regular electrocardiography in detecting paroxysmal atrial fibrilation after a major stroke."
28629898,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to weight loss by examining the effects of alpha lipoic acid and eicosinane on subjects with Type 2 diabetes. Their results suggest that alphalipoic-acide may be useful as an addition to a high-fat diet in patients with type 2 disease."
25006974,"In this paper, the authors present a thorough review of the most recent evidence on symptoms and severity in patients with mild to moderate mtbi. They conclude that there is no reliable basis for predicting whether concusses will lead to delayed return to play because of the high sensitivity of neuropsychological tests. However, they suggest that some patients may have more severe symptoms than others at the time of their injury. Brain scans are still recommended as part of the treatment for patients with moderate to severe brain injuries."
25963557,"In this study, the authors report that a delay in the initial treatment of breast cancer patients is not associated with reduced local control or survival. However, they conclude that delays in the introduction of new therapy should be avoided because it may lead to an increased risk of complications. They conclude that further studies are needed on delayed-initiation approaches for early breastcancer. The authors conclude that there is no association between delayed intervention and improved overall survival in these two groups. Furthermore, their results suggest that adjuvant treatments can be used to speed up the discovery of new drugs in early breastcarrying."
19776504,"In this paper, the effects of a three-year-long experiment on glass cement sealants are examined. The results show that the anti-caries effect of these two types of sealants is greater than that of any other type of sealant over a period of 3 to 5 years. These results suggest that it is necessary to use different types of teeth to confirm these results."
27505198,"This paper describes a six-month follow-up study of two groups of overweight and hungry adults. At the end of the trial, both groups show significant reduction in their reported weight over the next six months. Both groups also report less snacking during this time period. The results suggest that acceptance-based eating strategies may be effective for treating hunger-induced cravings. For example, when participants carry a chocolate box on their person without abstinencing from any food, it is observed that they are less likely to engage in ""emotional eating"" than those who do not have such habits."
25251296,"This paper focuses on the effect of weight gain on body fat distribution in patients with anorexia. It concludes that after one year, weight loss does not seem to be associated with regaining bone values; rather, it is associated with an increased and adistorted distribution of fat in the trunk region."
23235652,"In this paper, Lira focuses on the effect of zinc on small-for-gestational infants. She concludes that it is possible to improve health in low-birth weight infants by reducing their sensitivity to infection and improving their mental and motor skills. However, there are no significant changes in growth or development after eight weeks of treatment. The results suggest that iron and zinc can be used together to improve growth and development in children with low birth weight."
30058911,"In this study, Anderson focuses on the association between physical activity and elevated body mass-index in healthy subjects. He concludes that exercise is associated with reduced risk of Type 2 diabetes when compared to control, dieting-induced weight Loss or exercise without weight gain. This study was designed to determine whether diet-induced loss or exercise-induced weight loss were associated with improved health in moderately overweight men. All participants consented to the study; however, they were not satisfied with their assigned groups."
27473099,Estrogen replacement therapy for patients with Turner's syndrome is a promising new approach to treating the disease.
26739716,"This paper focuses on the use of opioids in patients with chronic low back pain and suggests that psychological factors may be important in predicting long-term outcome. In this study, we examine the effect of spinal manipulation on patients who are positive rather than negative about their pain scores. The mean change in effect from manipulative therapy to placebo is 0.3 point less at 1 week's follow-up when compared to those who are rule positive or negative. Conclusions and Reneval Three pieces of information were followed by a systematic recording of general practitioners prognostics judgment; these items provide a basic foundation for investigation the usefulnessof prognosesis in persons with painful conditions. These results suggest that intervention aimed at relieving pain-related fears might prevent restriction of activity and involvement because of pain, and might improve the recovery of acute LBP. Neck pain was not particularly well treated in this study but was still associated with severe sick leave. Fear avoidance beliefs were also present in some patients with neck pain and could be an important risk factor in explaining changes in behavior toward pain. A patient's age and severity of pain are strong predictors as to whether they will respond to spine manipulation. However, there are few studies"
29318741,This paper focuses on the use of loupes in students' pre-clinical education to improve their posture and reduce the risk of neck pain. It uses a case control study to examine the effects of wearing magnificent loupe glasses on patients who report pain.
23236190,"In this study, Wuthering Heights demonstrates the efficacy of a three-week course of mud therapy on patients with knee Ostearthritis. A significant reduction in pain scores was seen at all assessment points; however, there was no significant improvement in self-assessment after the end of treatment. This suggests that spa therapy can be used as a stand-alone treatment for these patients."
22575611,"Conclusions The results of this controlled investigation suggest that la motrigine is superior to placebo as a maintenance treatment for acute bipolar disorder, particularly for patients who have experienced relapse. Conscious that the long-term course of bipolar illness is chronic, conclusive evidence suggests that it may be prudent to consider more randomized trials in order to confirm or refute some of the earlier studies. Bipolar depression is characterized by a ""dimensional illness,"" which includes both manic and depressive symptoms. In contrast, bipolar I suffers from a similar disease process. Although there are differences in the severity of the patient's psychiatry, these differences do not seem to be significant enough to warrant further study."
30113661,"In this paper, we present a meta-analysis of the evidence for the use of prebiotics and probiotics as part of a total treatment for patients with non-alcoholic fatty disease."
30511328,"In this paper, we summarize the results of two large-scale, i.e., cross-examination studies that have been performed on patients with type 2 diabetes. The conclusion is that treatment of overweight and obesity in adults often fails because there is an ""irreversible cycle"" between weight gain and Type 2 disease. This vicious cycle may lead to irreversible changes in both body weight and blood pressure. Therefore, it is important for physicians to use metformin as a preventative measure against these complications. We conclude by examining the effects of metformedin on body weight, body composition, and glucose tolerance in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes. These results are not supported by any other evidence. However, they do suggest that meeting short-term lifestyle changes can be useful in preventing or reducing the risk of Type 2Disease."
17595425,"This paper focuses on the use of an evidence-based fall risk assessment tool, the Equality of Measures for Preventing Feasibility in Stroke, to evaluate the efficacy of a multiple intervention approach to prevent falls in the acute hospital setting. It is found that the Medtronic scale has poor predictive validity as a measure of whether a patient falls or is discharged from the hospital. In contrast, the Simple Risk Score predicts with good accuracy a high proportion of falls among older patients in patients. A prospective long-term follow-up study is required to further investigate the effectiveness of bed alarms and other measures of protection against falls."
23324965,"The results of this study suggest that the cementless cup wears more than a cemented cup. Ostelysis is common in young hips, but there are persistent problems with porous coated anatomic hip systems. Revision due to aseptic looseness was associated more to the thicker polyethylene linesr than to size of the fibrous head. After 10 years, no difference in bone loss occurs. In contrast, the Charnle cup has a better survival rate than the uncemented duraloc after 12 years."
23771266,"In this study, Wuthering Heights et al. concludes that the use of mud baths as an alternative to medical therapy in patients suffering from fibromyais is safe and can be used in treating other musculo-inflammatory disease."
25442969,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft demonstrates that social ties can play a key role in promoting large-scale cooperative behavior. He shows how subjects break and form new connections with other subjects to create an incentive for them to cooperate. The results of the experiments suggest that subjects tend to break their ties with defecters because they are more likely to be involved in larger-scale changes in the structure of the human social network. This suggests that there may be a kind of ""evolutionary game"" in which subjects act as co-creators rather than simply contributing to the good."
29508661,"The prostheses in the Triathlon-TKR system show similar early stability compared to those in the other knee replacements. In this study, we assess the safety of the use of a cement-coated triathlon-tibial bearing as a replacement for single-radius posterior stabilized total kneearthroplasty after 12 months. Although the cement seems to be more stable than uncemented bearings, it does not offer any advantage over the fb knee prosthesis when used with RSA. This suggests that even though Boneloc may lead to inferior results later than hip replacements, there is still a good chance that bone cement will last long enough to provide adequate fixation."
25162440,"This paper discusses the advantages and drawbacks of conservative treatment for patients with acute appendictis. It focuses on the use of percutaneous drainage aspiration and drainage to treat these patients, but it does not discuss the complications that may result from this approach. The authors conclude that initial conservative treatment is prudent, safe, and effective in treating acuteappendicol masses. They also suggest that early laparoscopic abscesses should be avoided because of the risk of misdiagnosed or delayed appendectomy."
29359958,"In this single-blind, encampment study, Wuthering Heights concludes that the efficacy of reveratrol in treating patients with Type 2 diabetes is not well studied. However, it does have some promising effects on blood pressure and may possibly be used as an adjuvant against Type 2D."
31521554,"In this paper, Morris and his co-response team conclude that a home-based program of balance training, leg strength training, and freeze of gait does not reduce falls in patients with milder or moderately severe disease. However, they advocate for a fully-powered trial to determine the efficacy of such a program. They conclude that ""intense focused physiotaph at home seems acceptable"" and may bring positive change into those who can do so. A further study needs to be performed to confirm these results. Home-based exercise is more effective in improving physical function than an exercise program supervised by another therapist. There are no significant differences between groups in overall health, total care cost, and QAlys; however, there is a trend toward greater improvements on muscle strength, walking, fear of falling, and other measures of balance. The BBS has been shown to be useful as a tool for assessment of balance function in older adults."
23958262,"In this paper, we present the results of a double-blind, quackery-controlled study in which we conclude that treatment with piglitazen does not reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease. However, we do find some evidence that it can be used as a preventive measure against these conditions."
31860103,"This paper concludes that the relative risk for hip fracture in patients with vitamin D deficiency is 1.69, a similar result to DecalyOs I. In addition, this study supports that daily high-dose Vitamin D may prevent Osteopardy and increase bone mineral density in elderly people living in an northern European region who are deficient in vitamins D. Conclusions These studies support that vitamin D or calcium supplementation might prevent osteoporiotic fractures among older long- term care residents in a Northern European regionknown to be depleted in vitamin D. The Major Findings of the Present study were that alfacalcicol did not affected serum 25HhD levels, and that its reduction the incidence of Osteaporotic Fractures and increased Bmd in comparison with AlfaCalcidol whether blood concentrations were higher than 20Nmol/L; furthermore, the major finding of the present trial was that eldestcalcitola did not affect Semaine Parathyroid Hormonism's levels. Furthermore, it reduced the frequency of falls without increasing the rate of fractures. Consistently, both groups received a"
15289592,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of exercise and lumbar support on back pain. He concludes that there are no significant differences between the two intervention groups in terms of pain severity or satisfaction. However, Anderson suggests that further research needs to be performed on the efficacy of both types of exercise. The evidence for the use of physical restraints is strong, but it does not lead to any reduction in work-related pain."
24855158,"Conclusions The combination of behavior-mapping with blood glucose and lifestyle behaviors.. This intervention improved glycerin levels over one year, and was accepted as an evidence-based intervention for patients with Type 2 diabetes. Conscious of the limited efficacy of this type of intervention, however, we conclude that it may be worthwhile for primary care offices to implement patient-centered approaches in order to improve quality of care."
29943231,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the relationship between injury risk and training load in elite athletics. Athletics are at high risk of injury for both men and women due to their participation in various forms of physical activity. A player's accumulated 12 months and recent 1 month of match exposure significantly influences his current injury risk; therefore, it is important to take measures to prevent injury from occurring. However, there is no significant increase in subsequent injury risks for high-intensity bouts for periods greater than 26 days. Furthermore, cricket fixtures are likely to have little contribution to increasing fast bowling injuries among young basketball players. This study concludes that higher participation in running type physical activity may be associated with increases in injury risk. Further studies need to be performed to determine the exact amount of training that can increase injury risk"
29596560,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft eloquently describes the effects of hypnogenetics on wound healing in post-surgery patients. The results suggest that hypnotism can be used to speed up wound healing and improve physical recovery. This study further establishes the importance of skin barrier injury for future research"
22723585,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights focuses on the effects of pre-adult age and hyperinaemia on the risk of some common West Americancancers. He concludes that excessive growth during adulthood can lead to increased susceptibility to certain types of malignancies, such as breast and typhoid scarlet fever. Furthermore, changes in body weight, eating habits, and physical activity may lead to an increase in the severity of these diseases."
26420387,"The results of this study suggest that a low-carrying, high-fat diet is associated with higher risk of fracture in elderly women. In addition, there is no association between the consumption of coffee and hip fracture among men. This conclusion supports the notion that ""calcium and vitamin D"" may prevent hip fracture from occurring in older women. Furthermore, these results suggest that drinking more than nine cups of coffee has an increased risk for fracture. Women who drink less than eight cups per day have a greater risk of developing a fracture than those who do not drink more than five or ten cups each day. Finally, it is concluded that both clinical risk factors as well as blood pressure are independently associated with risks of fractures in old women. These include poor nutrition, smoking, physical activity, falls, and age. A subset analysis suggests that long- term use of either calcium or vitaminD appears to reduce bone loss but does not lead to any significant reduction in fracture risk."
27416628,"This paper discusses the effects of diets, foods, nutrients, and other substance exposures during pregnancy and early childhood on the pathophysiological changes in adolescent children. It concludes that prenatal fish oil is not associated with reduced wheezeing in infants at age three. A probiotic was found to reduce atopic disease in babies who were breastfed during their first two weeks of life."
25767138,"In this paper, we describe the effect of single-set resistance training on both strength and function in patients with a chronic disease. We find that adding strength training to an aerobic regimen is associated with greater gains in muscle strength than does the addition of resistance training alone. This study concludes that specific upper extreme training may be advantageous in the treatment of patients with convalescent pulmonary disease."
25431555,"In this paper, we present the results of a randomized, blinded, and follow-up study of 180 children with moderate-to-high-risk ADHD who received either EEG-feedback or sham neurofeedback for six months. Although both groups showed significant improvements in their patients' symptoms, they were found to be more successful in treating children with ADHD than those receiving control treatment. We conclude that although there is still uncertainty as to how effective these two training approaches will be, it is clear that they are highly efficacious when compared to placebo."
30854594,"In this paper, Conclusions demonstrates that probiotics and lifestyle intervention have a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Probiotics are also more effective at reducing the severity of symptoms in people with Irritable Bulgar Syndrome than they are at treating other diseased patients. Furthermore, there is little evidence for their efficacy in treating patients with acute hysteria. Aprobiotics can be used as an alternative therapy for patients with chronic obstructive urolitic disease."
27405704,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the potential of genetic risk prediction to improve patient motivation for lifestyle change. He discusses the results of a large-scale, i.e. population-based randomised trial in which patients received their results from three different sources: 1) physicians who shared their test results with their patients during an approximate one-year follow-up interval; 2) physicians who provided their results directly to their patients while they were waiting for their results; and 3) physicians who offered their results through a web-based platform. The results suggest that using genetic risk information to motivate behavior change is not as effective as conventional risk-reduction methods."
25985235,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, i.e. random, single-blind study of 16 FXS patients with mild-to-severe hypersensitivity. We conclude that ALC appears to be safe and well tolerated in the treatment of these patients, but that it does not seem to have any effect on the entire population of children with ADHD. Furthermore, there are no significant side effects from the use of lac as an over-the-counter treatment for people with fragile x syndrome."
32382836,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft discusses the safety and efficacy of a new type of surgical treatment for patients with severe or persistent bleeding. He concludes that it is safe and effective, as well as more cost-effective than standard anecdote-based surgery. The results further support the use of prognostic predictors in future studies of haemorrhoidal diseases."
24392600,"In this paper, Conclusions outlines the evidence for the use of telemedicine to improve people's health. He concludes by stating that it is important to focus on improving self-efficiecacy, problem-solving and social-environmental support in order to improve patients' ability to manage their disease. Consistently, these results suggest that a ""distribution-based"" or ""empowerment-based,"" telehealth-based intervention may be more effective than other forms of treatment. This paper also discusses the relative efficacy of different types of lifestyle intervention with regard to improving blood sugar control in African Americans."
25142703,"Conclusions In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, i.e. single-blind, random-covariate analysis of fatigue in patients with breastcancer. We conclude that there is a strong association between fatigue and nighttime light exposure among women who have been treated with both adjuvant and curative treatment. Consistently, however, these results suggest that bright light therapy may be more effective than other treatments for improving fatigue during post-chemoprogressive disease."
29856237,"The results of a nurse-led intervention for stroke patients were more effective than usual care in improving bp and LDLc levels after 12 months follow-up. Conclusions That the efficacy of this particular intervention was limited in patients with high- performing hospitals, with regular post discharge follow up and communication with their general practice. However, it was found that the nursing intervention had short-term and long- term effects on functional, psychological, and emotional factors. Although nurse led intervention could have an effect on these outcomes, further studies should be performed to determine the effectiveness of such a strategy."
32201245,"In this paper, the authors present a meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials in which no significant changes were seen in blood pressure or heart rate. They conclude that Nigellasativa can be used as an effective anti-diabetic agent in Type 2 diabetes patients."
25828270,"In this paper, we examine the effect of bezafivebrate on thrombosis in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Although it does not reduce the risk of fatal heart attack or stroke, it does lead to improvements in haemostasis. We conclude that both treatment options are effective at preventing these events. Both drugs have beneficial effects on blood levels but do not increase the severity of cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, they may lead to improved standards of treatment for lower-limb Amputations."
31483070,"In this paper, we present the results of a single-blind, randomized, and sham-controlled trial on overactive bladder in women. We conclude that combination therapy is more effective than one-on-one treatment because it can lead to long-lasting improvements in both severity and frequency of symptoms. This study also provides evidence that using percutaneous nerve stimulation may be an effective treatment for patients with excessively active bladder."
25354945,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to assessing gastric volume using bedside ultrasonography. They describe two methods for grading the extent of the cross sectional area of the stomach in order to predict how much food should be given to patients during their stay at the hospital. First, they propose a three-point graduated system based on qualitative sonography that can be used as a ""biomarker."" Second, they develop a new method for predicting gastric contents from bedside ultrasound."
22525963,"In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the relationship between age, weight, and body mass index in women who had undergone a post-oophorcectomy. We conclude that there is no significant difference in age or weight between the two groups but that menstrual and reproductive factors seem to play a more important role than either group. The results suggest that both genders are at risk for increased hip and vertebral bone fractures when they have undergone an opphorectomy. This study does not support an independent role for or rogen as determinant of well being in postmenophausal women; however, it does provide evidence that obesity plays a key role in maintaining a healthy glyceic balance in the circulatory system."
29760253,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a two-year, i.e. long-term study of 86 patients who had been taking benzodylone as a last resort for their insomnia. After completeing the benzoral withdrawal, all subjects were given short-term behavioral intervention to improve their coping skills with insomnia. This intervention was found to be particularly effective in those with high psychological distress and anxiety. Both interventions resulted in significant reductions over the course of the patient's treatment. A structured approach with written individualized stepped dose reduction is more time-consuming than a more complicated intervention involving repeat visits. The findings suggest that tapering off is an effective way of stopping long- term benzdialescine use in primary care. Conclusions Both approaches lead to considerable reductions in Long-Term Benzalescine Use in patients without serious comorbity. Although both methods lead to significant decreases in long terms benzdaleesctinene use in people without severe remorse, they are promising for future research but should anticipate the difficulties inherent in conducting a trial on institutionalized elderly subjects.

26055921,"Conclusions B-Vitamins were not more effective in treating antidepressants than did B-Folate, but that they had a protective effect on depressed patients over time. These results suggest that high total daily b-vitamins are safe and inexpensive for the treatment of major depression in older adults. The most important association observed between folate levels and measures of mental function was found even after adjustment for gender, age, food, education, and household income. This conclusion supports the hypothesizes that low folate, lower B-12, and raised Hocysteinine levels may be risks factors for late life depression. Concluusions AdjunctiveL-methylfOlate at 15mg/day may prove to be an effective, safe, and relatively well tolerated strategy for patients who have major depressive disease. Further study into the interaction between FOL and sexrelion is needed. For example, Folate and Neopterin seem to be altered in the elderly. Furthermore, no specific supplementation has been found to increase folate or improve ADM. Therefore, the findings of the FolateD trial do not support the use of folic"

This paper provides a brief summation of previous findings; an up date 18th of December, a systematic review of medicinal/on-poxological studies; and our personal view on this topic."
23650680,"Conclusions The modified three-day bep regimen is safe and effective for patients with ovarian malignancies. In addition, the modified regimen has superiority in response rates and overall survival over standard chemometrism. Laparoscopic Fertiasparing Staging in early recurral obstructs tumors that do not require curative treatment. Although the role of second-look debulking remains undetermined, laparoscopic fertility sparing staging may have some advantage for select groups of patients. Acute cytoreplication followed by nonconservative therapy performed at the initial relapse after the childbirth completion is aneffective surgical strategy for those with bilateral early stage basal oblivion."
18843651,"In this study, the effects of a combination of analexin-converting inhibitors and calcium antagonists on blood pressure were investigated in patients with moderate to mildly essential hypertension as well as those with milder to moderate symptoms. The results suggest that these two agents can be used as first-line treatments for mild to moderate primary hypertension. Although there are side effects, most importantly headaches, nausea, and coughing, no significant difference in severity between the two groups. A single dose of clamipril reduces blood pressure by 24 hours without any change in renal function. This suggests that quinpil may be useful as a second-line treatment for mild or moderate chronic hypertension because it does not interfere with the autonomic response to postural changes."
28093732,"This paper presents the results of a large, randomized, controlled trial of long term use of estrogen alone or in combination with progesterin. The results suggest that continuous combined Estrogen Plus Progestin increases incident breastcancers, which are diagnoseed at a greater advanced stage than with placebo use, and also considerably increases the percentageof women with abnormal Mammograms after treatment. Although this study is not intended to be used as a source of information for decision making about postmenopalal hormone therapy, it does provide some support for the use of short-term regimens. Women who have an event during the first two years of their menopause do not experience any increased risk of heart disease; however, they do experience a reduced risk of stroke. In addition, there was no evidence of improved quality of life among women who had previously undergone hemipectomy."
10789614,"In contrast, patients who do not have peptic gastriums fare the same whether they receive colloidal subcitration or placebo. These results indicate that treatment with colloidalbismuth subcurrate does not improve their symptoms in patients without having had an ulcer. This is due to the fact that H. Pylori has been implicated in the development of this disease. After two weeks of combined therapy, patients are noted to have improved their symptoms. The need for long observation periods after anti-bacterial treatment in these patients is also confirmed. Helicobacter politely suppresses the infection but does not cure it. At one yr, triple therapy appears to be more beneficial than control therapy at first. A high proportion of patients experience relapse within six wk and recovery from treatment is not evident during this study. Conclusions We conclude that there is no significant association between Chlorobacter pricotia and other diseases. Urcer disease is less common in developed countries as well as in those from developing countries. Uller disease only accounts for a small portion of subjects withsymptoms and neither H. dyphoid infection nor Gastrites are significantly"
17720798,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the reliability and specificity of several different physical examination tests used for the diagnosis of superior labral tears in overheadthrowing patients. He concludes by comparing the results of these tests to those obtained from other studies. The evidence suggests that control comparative local Anesthetic block of facet joints are reproducible, reasonably accurate, and safe; however, there are some false-positive results among patients with inferior lesions. These results suggest that an instability exam performed on all three test is highly specific as well as predictive of traumatic acute anterior shoulder instability. A positive impingement signal correlated strongly with under surface tearing ofthe rotator's cuff or /or tear of the posteriorlabrum in athletics with gradually onsetof posterior shoulder painDuring overh and Athletics. Conclusions Although Speed's and Yeergason's tests were moderately specific, they did not produce a large shift in the posttest probability and were unlikely to make any significant change in pretest diagnosis"
26104189,"This paper focuses on the use of wearable technology to track activity and weight loss in overweight and obese adults. It concludes that physical activity can be used as a preventative measure against long-term health problems by using wearable devices with real time feedback. In addition, it suggests that this type of technology may be more effective than other forms of weight loss intervention."
18751709,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of a six-week exercise and education program designed to improve the symptoms of patients with fms. We conclude that it is possible to use these two approaches to treat fibromyalsgia in both men and women. Although there are some drawbacks as to the efficacy of either approach, we do agree that short-term exercise or education can be very effective in relieving pain and improving physical function."
25806470,"Women with af are at greater risk for stroke than men because of their higher risk of developing blood clots. They also have a lower risk of major bleeding from warfarin, which is more likely to occur in women than it does in men. Conclusions In this paper, we describe the results of a large-scale prospective observational study of patients with acute fistbital disease. We conclude that there is no difference in the outcome between men and women when it comes to the use of antithrombotic drugs."
19748548,"In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the caries preventive effects of glass-Ionomers and their use in sealants over a period of 3 to 5 years. The results show that the anti-caries effect of these materials is superior to that of conventional sealants after 1 to 3 years. This study will be used in a prospective clinical trial to determine the efficacy of these new materials in treating children."
29406457,"The aim of this study is to determine the relative efficacy of different flexion, extension, and splint options for patients with knee Ostearthritis who have undergone four total knee replacements. In particular, the authors report that there is no significant relationship between posterior slope of cutting and the Post-Oppossession ROM. They suggest that alternate flexing and extension are more effective in regaining full range of motion after total knee surgery."
29681480,The results of this prospective study suggest that the use of retrograde root filling material as a post-imploresive treatment option for patients with apicomarcal defects is superior to those obtained by conventional methods.
25076495,"In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the association between tree nuts and risk of Type 2 diabetes. Nuts are particularly associated with reduced risk of developing type 2 disease in women. We conclude that higher consumption of walnuts is also associated with lower risk of setting blood sugar levels in patients with Type 2 disease. Furthermore, our results suggest that high-walnut consumption may be more effective than other dietary approaches in preventing or reducing the risk of heart disease in people with Type 1 disease."
28785411,"This paper focuses on the use of performance-related measures to track changes in athletic performance over time. It concludes that although there is no single reliable biological marker for NFor in these athletes, the Restq-76 sport question naire might be useful for tracking responses to it in team sport players. The results confirm the hypothalamy-pituital dysfunction during ostessipation and suggest that central fatigue may precede peripheral fatigue. Other systems, including the nervous system, are also more likely to respond later in an exhaustive training period."
22387009,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the effects of physical exercise on several important markers of body weight, including blood lipids, lipoproteins, and heart function. It concludes by stating that ""exercise training"" has been shown to have some beneficial effects on these markers in overweight children. However, it is not yet clear whether this effect is due to diet or physical training."
10796152,"The aim of this paper is to summarize the current evidence for the use of inodine in pregnancy as a preventative measure against fetal malignition. In particular, it has been reported that maternal typhoidism may lead to an increase in the size of the mother's thyroid and thus contribute to the development of premature babies."
26897342,"Conclusions A culturally tailored after school dance and screen-time reduction intervention was effective for preventing childhood obesity among low- income African American girls, but did not reduce body mass in comparison to health education. This intervention may be due to its effects on healthy eating at home and at school rather than on increases levels of paternal activity. Conscious that this approach does not lead to significant changes in weight status or body shape, the authors conclude that it is possible to use ""remote coaching supported by cell phones and financial incentives held promise to improve food and activity."" However, these approaches are not as effective as those used in primary care. The Eat Well and keep Moving program has been shown to have positive effects on improving dietary habits and reducing TV watching. In contrast, the Fataint Phat intervention had no effect on physical activity nor on fat gain. It also had significant negative effects on children's selfefficacy toward reducing television watching."
21438991,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective observational study in which 147 patients underwent either gastric or gastric-partitioning procedures. The overall mortality rate was 12 percent and the surgical complications were less than one-fifth of the patients receiving either procedure. Although both procedures result in improved weight loss, they are more likely to have adverse events. Both procedures lead to better weight loss as soon as three months after the initial operation. However, the patient's appetite suppresses and their excess weight loss is greater when compared to the other two treatments. Adverse events occur at every consultation; however, it is not uncommon for physicians to observe such an event. A significant number of correctedable problems occurred during the period of the study. Conclusions That bariatic surgery for severe overweight is associated with longer term weight loss and reduced overall mortality. These conclusions are based on the use of two instruments: method scientific quality and clinical relevancy. Each score between 0 and 1 indicates that the article has received drug company support. Two reviewers independently assess each article using blinded questions about whether the article had been accepted in a published symposium. For each article, one of them determines whether"
26882490,"The efficacy of Phospatra's extended-spectrum ecstasy in treating patients with lumbar nerve injury has been reported. In this paper, we describe the results of a double-blind, quackery-controlled trial using sildenalfil as a single agent to treat patients with spinal cord injuries. We conclude that it is safe and highly effective for the treatment of men with hemiparous nerve injury."
20012073,"In this paper, the authors conclude that there are no reoperations for the first year after total hip surgery. They do not find an adverse effect of weight bearing on the patients immediately after the operation. However, they note that some patients may have late loosening due to excessive weight bearing. This is supported by the results of a randomized study in which nine patients were treated with full weight bearing during their first year and another eighteen patients received partial weight bearing at the end of the second year."
30088015,"In this paper, the authors discuss the current evidence for the use of pulse-taking and ECGs as tools for early detection of atrial fibrillation in patients over age 60. They conclude that warfarin should be used as a preventive measure because it is more effective than aspirin; however, there are further concerns about the safety of using these newer approaches to prevent stroke in Japanese patients who have previously received no treatment for their atrial fibrilation. A patient with a history of heart failure, valving heart disease, and stroke could be associated with an increased risk of sudden death in the community when compared with those without such conditions. Confusion exists regarding the appropriateness of rate control for the management of atrium fibrillation. Although rate control is not superior to rhythm control in the prevention of fatal and morbid events from cardiovascular causes, it is possible to achieve acceptable results in patients with persistent atrial fever."
32216045,"The results of this study suggest that drinking water and ns-beverages were not equivalent to weight loss or maintenance in consuming these beverages during a one-year behavior treatment program. This suggests that they can be useful tools for weight loss, as long as they are combined with other forms of weight management. Consuming sucrose blinded in soft drinks is partially compensated by obese women who have been previously experimented with. In addition, the replacement of sugary soft drinks with alcohol reduces body weight gain over a period of 12 weeks. Furthermore, it has been reported that replacing sugar sweetened beverages with aspartume may lead to greater weight loss among overweight and obese adults. These studies suggest that taking part in a ""multidisciplinary weight control program"" including aspartamie may help prevent further weight gain."
29189928,"This paper focuses on the effects of resistance training and endurance exercise on health risk. It concludes that resistance training is more effective than physical activity at preventing weight gain in healthy, normal-sized adults. In addition, it suggests that women with higher BMIs may be better able to recognize when they are at risk of becoming overweight. Conscious of the fact that this type of behavior does not lead to weight gain, however, we suggest that primary preventive measures should be used to avoid excessive weight gain. Conclusions That regular activity breaks were as effective as continuous physical activity for decreasing postprar and Ial Glycemia or Insulemia in healthy adulthood. These results support the hypocrisy of the previous studies regarding the association between sitting time and body weight. However, these studies do not show any relationship between siting time and weight gain over the following four years."
30369810,"This paper presents the results of a three-part, cross-sectional study on bonding strength of orthodontic braces. The first part compares the strength of self-etched braces to that of conventionally buffed braces; the second part examines the influence of debonding forces on bond strength."
24217903,"In this chapter, the narrator discusses the effects of growth-hormone replacement in adult patients with adult gh deficiencies. He concludes that it is an effective treatment for these patients because it induces small increases in their left ventric preload and improves body composition. Hisochondriac hypertrophy is not associated with changes in blood pressure or heart function. However, there are other risk factors involved in adult GHD, such as elevated levels of coriolanin and increased susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. This chapter also discusses some of the more recent developments in the use of GH instead of statin therapy in treating adult GH. These include improvements in body composition, reduced circulating glutathianics, and improved absorption of endotolium from large and small vessels."
29399794,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the evidence for the use of antiepiotic drugs in patients with epileptic disease. They conclude that there are several drawbacks to the treatment of epilepsy patients and that it is necessary to ensure adequate levels of vitamin D in these patients so as to prevent bone malacia."
25409296,"This paper focuses on the relationship between physical activity and body fat in adulthood. It discusses the effects of endurance training, resistance training, and high intensity physical training on health risk. In particular, it suggests that vigorous physical activity is associated with reduced body fatness in young adults. However, this does not hold true to older adults who are more physically active than they are in younger adults."
28228371,"This paper focuses on the use of dance as an exercise modality for patients with chronic heart failure. Its main aim is to determine whether dancing can be used as a treatment for these patients. In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective, i.e., open-label, random-experimentation study in which we investigated the efficacy of dance training for people with severe rheumatric pain. We conclude by stating that it has been found that dance can be very effective in relieving pain and improving quality of life among patients with recurrent heart failure who are not at risk of injury."
28340030,"The results of this study suggest that telemedicine can be used to improve Type 2 diabetes in primary care settings. Sweet Talk is not as effective as other methods for improving blood glucose control, but it may have an effect on the introduction of intensified insulin therapy. Conclusions A web-based self-care program was more effective than usual care for patients with Type 2 who were poorly controlled. Although there were no significant differences between group groups, both approaches improved their glyciemic control. In addition, they showed improvements in patient satisfaction and quality of life when compared to standard care. These conclusions support further research into how these interventions can be best used in practice."
15846630,"This paper discusses the advantages and drawbacks of different surgical techniques for treating chronic anal pain. The narrator concludes that both methods are effective in relieving pain and improving patient comfort. He also discusses some of the disadvantages of each type of surgery, such as long post-opportune intervals to avoid scarring and delayed wound healing."
28060187,"In this paper, the authors present a long-term follow-up study of an elderly population. They conclude that simvastain treatment for five years is associated with survival benefits over 10 years in terms of both mortality and risk of death. Conclusions Elevated Ueda has been associated with increased Cardiomorbidity and Mortality after ten years of follow up. These conclusions are supported by evidence from large trials that suggest statins may be useful in patients with moderately elevated UAE. However, they do not appear to increase life expectancy or improve blood pressure control. Proser suggests that elderly patients with high-risk hypertension may benefit immediately from treatment."
20459784,"In this chapter, Wuthering Heights discusses the benefits of physical exercise for improving bone strength in young girls. He argues that it is important to use evidence from scientific review s to help practitioners make informed decisions about treatment for their patients."
31067200,"This paper focuses on the relationship between body mass and risk of death in overweight and obesity-affected subjects. It discusses the use of bariatric surgical intervention to reduce blood pressure in patients with both Type 1 and Type 2 disease. In this paper, we examine the association between weight gain and elevated blood pressure as well as the role of sympathetic nerves in hypertension. We conclude that there is a clear relationship between increased blood pressure and fat accumulation in obese subjects."
28380067,The results of this study suggest that the use of chi-quaigong for treatment of fatigue is safe and can be used in patients with a variety of musculosities.
20459783,"In this paper, the authors present a series of evidence-based studies that suggest that moderate levels of activity, including walking, may reduce risk of coloncancer. They conclude that physical activity can be used as a preventive measure against breast cancer in women who have not used any form of treatment for their disease. Although these studies do not show any significant association between exercise and all causes of death, they support the notion that it is important to encourage older people to increase their physical activity."
29478682,"In this paper, the authors describe the results of a root canal study using two different instrumentation techniques: Ni-ti rotary instruments and lightspeed files. The results indicate that all three are effective in cleaning the root canal; however, they do not remove any significant amount of debris during the preparation process. All three methods have similar efficacy in reducing the amount of dead dentin on the surface. However, there is a significant difference in how much debris can be removed from the wall when the technique is used with either Naocl or EDTA. These results need confirmation by more diverse assessors."
28182680,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of preterm birth on infants' ability to respond to pain and to develop an understanding of how these problems relate to neuropsychiac and behavior problems. He concludes by arguing that early intervention is necessary in order to prevent long-term morbidities from developing."
30948819,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of a recent study on the effects of biphasic drugs on heart function. Biphasidic drugs have been shown to be more effective in treating hypertension than their placebo-controlled counterparts. This paper also discusses some of the side effects that may be associated with the use of antihysterotoxic agents. For example, patients who are experiencing dizziness due to hypotension after taking 50mg of bisoproplol had a greater effect on blood pressure than those who were not."
17253466,"Conclusions The results of this study suggest that both psychological treatments, such as Cognitive Behavior Therapy and Applied Relaxation, are effective for patients with moderate to severe anxiety disorder. However, they do not extend to the performance or physiological measures of anxiousness."
25109883,"The results of this study suggest that a combination of leg-muscle blood flow restriction and slow walking training induces muscular hypertrophy, but the minimal intensity of exercise intensity is not sufficient to induce anabolism. A sense of control towards exercise was important in older people's adherence to these home-based exercises. Although physical health factors were the primary indications of an elderly person's overall involvement in the program, it was only the psychological factors which were most important for adherence"
28787537,"This paper concludes that a long-term treatment of bp in elderly patients with moderately high blood pressure is safe and can be relied upon to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events. Although this study was underpowered, it did show that strict control of systelic blood pressure was superior to an even lower target of 160mmHg for older patients. In particular, the rate of death from all causes was significantly lower in the intense treatment group. These results are important because they provide strong support for the recommendations of the recent hypertension guideline recommended by the American College of Physicians. Furthermore, these results suggest that there may be a different response among elderly patients when their blood pressures are as high as those recommended by current guidelines."
26198702,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft eloquently describes the effects of probiotic treatment on infants at risk for atopic skin disease. He concludes that Lactobacilus GG is an effective and safe regimen for preventing early-onset eczyma in children at low risk of developing such an illness. However, there are no significant differences between the concentrations of both IgE and total blood igE in the two groups during pregnancy and later infancy; furthermore, they do not show any difference in sensitization to food or in the amount of IgG in the breast milk. Furthermore, these results suggest that gut colonization by probiotics can be used as a natural immunemodulator against childhood atypia."
25984731,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights focuses on the importance of identifying individuals with poor antiplatelet function in order to prevent strokes and other major adverse events. He concludes by stating that it is important for physicians to use standard regimens because they are more likely to have aspirin sensitive platelet assemblage than patients who have an acute coronary disease. He also discusses the possibility of using modified-aspirin regimens to treat T1DM patients instead of conventional antiplatelets. The results suggest that there may be multiple reasons for poor clinical outcome in these patients: inadequate inhibition of Cox-1; lack of cox-1 activity; and delayed dosing. Assuming that all three factors contribute to poor patient outcomes, Wollstonecraft concludes that ""impaired responsiveness"" to aspirine does not relate to increased blood vessel relapses. A large number of elderly patients suffer from severe ischemic diseases such as paternal atheotomies."
17312231,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective observational study in which patients with multiple-vessel heart disease were treated with epidural blocks. This was followed by a controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of different surgical anestries for patients with severe chest wall injuries. The authors conclude that epidental analgesis can be used as an alternative to general anestesia in these patients. However, they do not report any significant differences in morbidity after major open vascular surgery."
26561616,"In this paper, the effects of a low-carbohydrate diet on total and lipoprotein concentrations are examined. The results suggest that nuts can be used as a preventive measure against major cardiovascular disease. Aiming to improve blood lipid levels in patients with moderately hypercholestemia, the authors present a novel approach by incorporating coconuts into an aecdote-based diet. They show that consumption of coconuts can lead to significant reductions in both LDL and C-H1cholesterol levels."
30599499,"In this paper, the authors present a comparison of two different approaches to treating neurogenic overactiveness in patients with spine cord injury. The authors favor suburohelial onbotantinA because it allows more precise localization and results in a significant decrease in urinary tract pressure after SCI. However, there is no significant improvement in symptoms after three repeated bonton-a doses. A post-treatment Magnetic Resonance Imaging study will provide further insight into how these treatments work and whether or not they can be used as an alternative treatment for patients with spinal Cord injury."
30616454,"This paper presents the results of a single-arm, single-many-manufactured study on the efficacy of the Orthopicte navigation system in patients with severe pre-operative hip deformity. The results suggest that this technique can be used to improve stability and reduce the need for additional leg lengthening. In addition, it is possible to restore normal hip anatomy without altering the patient's post-opportunity."
30177287,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of an irrational single blind, multi-centre, placebo-controlled study that confirms the use of IFN Alpha-2b as a safe and effective treatment for Peyrisone's disease in patients with PD. We conclude by stating that these studies are not sufficient evidence to recommend any other treatment for peyronie ""s disease."""
26416579,"The results of this study suggest that the reduction of low-denoliterate LDL levels may be a useful predictor of heart disease in patients with elevated high-cholesterol levels. However, it is not clear whether these patients are at risk for developing mechasis. In contrast, anthocin seems to have a protective effect on both lipoprotein and phospholipid levels. These results suggest that treatment with simvastain has a potential role in preventing or delaying the transformation of ""non-alcoholic  Steatohepatis."" This work also suggests that sim vastatin may play a beneficial role in protecting against ""oxidative stress"" in Type 2D patients."
24794372,"In this chapter, we present the results of a long-term observational prospective study on height gain after puberty for children with marked short stature who have been treated with growth-hormones. The safety and efficacy of these newer treatments are not yet fully established; however, recent surveillance studies suggest that GH treatment does not increase risk for malignancies or new diseases in children with prediuspidity."
24808490,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of sucrose on heart disease. He suggests that it may be more important to induce hyperinsulimmation in some people than to its effect on other risk factors. He concludes by stating that only some people show ""sucrore-induced hyperininism"" and that these are those who have consumed too much sucrose. This conclusion is followed by a detailed discussion of the relationship between sugar consumption and blood pressure and lipoproteins."
18029834,"In this paper, the authors present a brief overview of the evidence for the use of activity-retrieval devices in patients with Type 2 diabetes. They conclude that short-term physical activity intervention using a walking program can be used to improve blood pressure and body composition in older adults who are at risk for Type 2 disease. A 24-week walking program meets the American College of Athletics' recommended daily physical activity recommendation. This program is particularly effective in reducing systelic bpox in women with type 2 hypertension. However, these results do not lead to an increase in food consumed when physical activity is increased by walking more than 200 additional steps each day. Further studies need to be performed on older adults with severe knee obstructive rheumitis. Walking increases strength and function in people with NDM. People with NMD should walk more when they are told to take 1,000 steps per day instead of those instructed to go brisk 30min walks. This suggests that exercise can be delivered throughout the day as well as reduced caloric consumption."
21339335,"This paper describes the effects of a single irrational dose of gh on patients with acute and chronic GH-induced hypoglycemia. It suggests that this treatment may be more effective than statin therapy in people with high-DhLc levels. Furthermore, it suggests that statins can be used to treat elderly patients with low-dose GH."
24384894,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the association between sarcopenia and physical disability in patients with lungcancer. He discusses the use of objective fatigue tests to predict risk of mortality in breastcancer patients and suggests that such tests may be useful in future studies. The results of this study suggest that malnutrition is related to low health-resource status in advanced non-small cell lung disease. A diet high in phosphorus but low in iron or folic acid prevents weight loss in preterminal lung cancer patients. Although these patients receive no treatment, they are more likely to survive than expected."
23419910,"This paper focuses on the effects of moderate-load, high-restraining weight training on strength and balance in people with parakinsonism who have a history of motor loss. It concludes that moderate-volume, high load training is more effective than other forms of exercise for improving lower-body health in persons with paternal disfigurement."
30225547,"In this paper, the first four drugs are systematically compared against placebo in terms of their efficacy for improving early-ejaculations. The results suggest that they may be useful as initial treatment for patients with moderately to severe premature earcutteration. A mixed-patient-and-female study is conducted to evaluate the efficaciousness of paroxentine, dapaxetine, and tramadastol in treating men with mild-to-hearse premature eryculation."

31415611,"This paper focuses on the association between unsaturated fats and total short-chain fatty acids, particularly in relation to Type 2D risk. It concludes that there is little evidence for an association between long-chain or trans-fatty acid concentrations of these fats in humans. However, it does suggest that they may be related to lower levels of T1D risk from different food sources."
30700025,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the association between low 25-OHD levels and risk of death among middle-aged older men. He concludes that there is an indirect association between lower 25-hydroxyvinamin D levels and increased risk of mortality in those with higher levels. This suggests further evidence for the role of vitamin D in health effects. The strongest association between 25-H dihydroxyvitamin C concentrations and all cause mortality was observed among African Americans who had very low levels; it was not particularly influenced by current chronic diseases. These findings suggest that low-25-OHd concentrations may play a key role in both disease and mortality. However, these results need to be reexamined in large-scale studies."
25431132,"This paper focuses on the effects of exercise on women during their menopause period. It concludes that physical activity appears to improve mood, sleep quality, and general health in mid-life women. However, it does not reduce risk of heart attack or stroke among women who have been treated with HRT. In addition, there are no significant changes in waist circumference, body fat, or other measures of quality of life after 12 weeks of vigorous exercise. The results suggest that this treatment may be useful for women at lower risk of low blood pressure and perhaps osteoprosis. A pilot study is conducted to determine whether yoga can be used as a treatment for middle-aged females without prior training. These results indicate that an appropriate regimen of endurance exercise should be recommended for these women."
28686645,"In this paper, the results of a large-scale, randomized, controlled trial are presented. The results suggest that daily or weekly doses of 1,000 IU of ""oral vitamin D"" can help prevent hypertension and improve health in patients with low blood pressure. Furthermore, there is an association between high levels of 25-hydroxyvindomin D and risk of heart attack among blacks. This suggests that future trials need to be performed on blacks who lack sufficient levels of this powerful nutrient. A random effect meta-analysis is used to pool the results from included studies. Although it does not support long-term use of IVD for prevention of cardiovascular disease, such as those with advanced hemithropy, these results do not fit into the definition of preventive medicine."
26548872,"In this paper, the effects of a variety of surface treatments on bonding strength are examined. These include: 1) using airborne biting to increase the roughness of the surface; 2) using a series of different types of pretreatments to improve the hardness and consistency of the cement; and 3) using an electric current to induce bonding between the two materials. The results indicate that all three methods work well for bonding both solid and non-solid surfaces. However, it is necessary to choose the right type of cement for long-lasting bonding."
24514899,"The results of this study suggest that a low-dose combination of statin and colestipol can be more cost effective than monotherapy in reducing the risk of heart attack among patients with elevated LDL levels. In particular, it is concluded that adding zetamibe to a high-dose statin regimen can lead to significant reductions in total cholesterol but does not increase the effect of circulating Epcs. Furthermore, these results suggest that add-on treatment with eztimibe or simvastain may have an additional beneficial effect on blood lipid levels. This paper concludes that there is no incremental benefit from the use of neacin to augment statin therapy for a 36 month follow-up interval; however, some studies indicate that switching to zingerimibe at higher doses leads to greater improvements in overall lipid profiles as well as improved attainment of target LDL C levels. These findings suggest that combination therapy for Dyphilia holds promise as efficacious treatment for patients who have multiple lipid diseases. Conclusions Ezetimbe/sigmavastatin provides greater improvements by lowering both lipoprotein concentrations and total cholesterol levels. A"

20524996,"This paper concludes that sucrose, rather than stimulants, appetite or negatively mood in normal weight subjects. Consuming a large volume of APM sweetened soda reduces sugar consumption without affecting other nutrients. Conclusions These results suggest that increasing the Ca-to-Protection Ratio over twofold by drinking a calcium fortified drink for 12 months does not increase body weight, body fat, or abdominating fat composition in women. Ingesting both types of soda reduced consumption of sugar fromthe diet without altering other nutrients; this trial was registry at medical trials. Gov as NCT000149695. Preliminary results show no significant differences between the effects of various combination of beverages on health status of healthy adults. The across treatment weight loss observed when combined with evidence on fluid-damage relationships suggests that optimistically adequate fluid intake might be higher than commonly recommended. Further studies are needed to verify these results and further research is needed"
30302558,"The results of this study suggest that a combination of statins and ezeetimibe can be more effective in reducing the risk of heart disease in patients with elevated lipoprotein levels. In particular, it is concluded that switching to combination treatment with 10 or 40mg ezetamibe produces greater improvements in several lipid-related parameters than doubled atorvastapin doses. Furthermore, both treatments have superior efficacy in preventing atheroscomatose disease. This conclusion supports the notion that statin therapy may be an effective strategy for improving lipid goal attainment in patients who require lipid reduction."
29397561,"In this paper, we summarize the results of two randomized controlled trials in which ezetimbe was shown to improve lipoprotein concentrations in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The first trial showed that adding ezetimibe directly to statin therapy improved both total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations but did not lead to any changes in glucose or lipid profiles. The second trial used a double blinded placebo-controlled design whereby subjects received 25 g fibers as an addition to their statin regimen. This treatment also improved blood glucose and other measures of well-being. A mixed-control study using fixed-dose combination of escuvastain and zetamibe found that it was more efficacious than either statin or simvatatiin alone for reducing low-denity lipophospholipid levels. These results support the use of high- potency statin on these patients."
24954489,"The prostheses are compared in terms of stability and migrating. After 12 months, they are safe for total knee replacement. There are no changes in the size or shape of the cup during the follow-up; however, there are some differences in the degree of subsidence between the two groups. In contrast, the cement used to cement the stem performs better than any other type of bone cement. Both types of cement have different mechanical properties. Cementing the tial part offers more stable fixation for 5 years but does not improve the performance of this device. This suggests that it is essential to use good instrumentation to create stable stem allograft constructs in the defects of the fimoral canal. Finally, the results suggest that ""an uncemented/non-ha-coated"" knee prosthesis may behave as well as cemented ones in the longterm. These conclusions emphasize the need for prospective introduction of these new devices in patient studies and national registrys. Conclusions This study confirms that highly crosslinked polyethylene wears less rapidly than conventional ultra high molecular weigh polyethylene. However, longer term follow up is needed to determine whether this will result in improved surgical performance and longevity"
29739343,"In this paper, Conclusions elucidates the association between high-circulating IL-16 and poor physical performance in older adults. They suggest that exercise may be an effective strategy to counteract age-related changes in body composition and strength."
24714894,"In this paper, we present the results of a large-scale cross-sectional study in which we examined the association between body fat and blood pressure in two different genders. We conclude that although both genders may be at high risk for developing heart disease, they are unlikely to be spared from excessively high blood pressure. Although further assessment is needed, it is suggested that intervention should be focused on improving schoolchildren's physical health. The results suggest that schools can be an effective strategy for preventing elevated blood pressure among young children in Brazil."
25427719,"In this single-blind, rat-controlled study, the effects of two different forms of beta blocker on blood pressure are investigated. The first is an inhaled form that acts as a ""partial agonist"" by blocking the action of the alpha-adrepressors. The second is a more rapid-acting form that does not affect blood pressure at all but only reduces it to a small extent. This study concludes that both types of drugs can be used to treat primary hypertension."
19683859,"In this paper, Conclusions focuses on the role of the bladder in pathophysiology of menstrual dysfunction. He uses a lentiviral approach to identify the seven P2X-receptors that are associated with symptoms of dutsor instability and their association with other disease states. He concludes by comparing the expression of these seven receptors with that of control bladders. Conclusions suggests that there is a potential for an electrical current in the bladder as a result of the interaction between the two types of cells."
26561769,"In this paper, Conclusions focuses on the effects of Cpp-Ac on the bonding strength of four different types of tooth-adhearing adhesives. He concludes that it is important to have strong bonding systems in order to prevent tooth decay and to achieve long-term results. He discusses the advantages and drawbacks of each type of system as they relate to the patient's dentin condition. The main problem with these studies is that there are no direct pulp treatments or other materials that can be used to treat primary teeth. Conscious of the negative effects of caries-induced enamel discoloration, Conclisions recommends shortening the one-up bond F application time so that the manufacturer's recommended amount of etching will not be too much. This also improves the life expectancy for Class I and class II restorations."
16933148,"This paper focuses on the effect of workstation, eyewear, and behavioral intervention on pain, symptoms, and function in new hires. While both groups experience significant reductions in pain from pre-to-post measures, there is no significant difference between groups for any end-of-period outcome measures. The addition of two-session task stress management does not significantly increase the short-term improvement brought about by this intervention alone. In contrast, the additional job stress management program does not improve long-term changes in pain or functional limitation. However, it does lead to improvements in physical examination results after 12 weeks of use of the same type of desk. There is no further improvement in nerve latency when compared to using the conventional schedule. Furthermore, the use of an office software program encourages workers to take frequent breaks which contributes to improved recovery from neck and back pain. These benefits do not appear to be associated with reduced risk of upper-limb pain. Instead, they seem to be related to specific postures. For example, one group uses a fixed tabletop while the other uses ""floating"" postures that are more common among employees under 40 years old. Both groups report improving their health and workstyle habits as a result"
28251287,"This paper summarizes the results of a large-scale, randomized, controlled trial on the efficacy of exercise and nutrition in improving muscle mass, strength, and function in frail older people. It concludes that resistance training is an effective strategy for counteracting weakening muscles in elderly people. However, it does not improve body composition or muscle strength in this population."
28215182,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights focuses on the use of the pain-relief scale as an assessment tool for patients in the ed. He concludes that it is difficult to interpret changes in pain scores from one patient to another because they are so different. For example, children with severe pain have a higher score on the pain relief scale than those with less severe pain. This study also provides important information about the relative importance of pain severity and need for pain treatment in children. Although there is some disagreement regarding the exact amount of pain relief that can be obtained by using the pain response scale, Wuthering Heights suggests that the measure should be used instead of the VAS when assessing pain in children over time."
25577154,"Losartan appears to be the most effective treatment for hypertension, particularly in reducing the risk of heart failure among patients with new-onset disease. In addition, it reduces the frequency of hospitalized myocardia and mortality among those with high blood pressure. Furthermore, lossartan has a greater reduction in left atrial mass than other drugs. The only significant difference between these two regimens is that they are associated with reduced left ventricular size. These conclusions suggest that black patients may not respond favorably to loseartan therapy as opposed to monotherapies. However, this does not support an appropriate first-line recommendation for losingartan. A sub-analysis concludes that ""long-term presence"" of Type I or Type II diabetes can lead to worse outcomes when compared with diuretics. This conclusion supports the suggestion that amlopril should be used as a preventative measure against major cardiovascular complications in elderly patients."
29088103,"The results of this study suggest that probiotics can be used to prevent or delay the onset of preterm disease, particularly in infants with low-birth birth weights. In addition, they can reduce the risk of nosocoma and sepisis, two of the most common causes of death in preterm babies."
31835340,"In this paper, Concluson focuses on the use of a combination of conventional and MRI-based approaches to assess the severity of shoulder joint disease. Although conventional methods such as radiography and sonography are used to follow up known bone destruction in patients with recurrent RA, they are not recommended as additional tools in the initial diagnoses when negative results are obtained. Concliuson concludes that MRI is highly sensitive for detecting early stages of RA; however, it does not provide accurate information about the extent of the disease. The most specific form of MRI for RA is Bone Marrow Edema, which can be easily detected by a single plane of cradle marrow mass. Conclamation suggests that a patient's first step should be an MRI scan at the first appearance of rheumaloid arthritis."
31907492,"This paper presents the results of a prospective, observational study on infants fed a soy-flavoring formula for 28 days. The results suggest that feeding this formula does not increase the risk of developing cow's milk intolerance and that it is therefore prudent to use this product as an alternative to conventional feeding."
29480736,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to evaluating the effect of whole grain consumption on risk of cardiovascular disease in an at-risk population. They conclude that white rice consumption is not associated with any increased risk of heart disease among Iranian men. Furthermore, they suggest that prebiotics can alter the gut microbeta composition by selectively changing the gut microbial composition in obese females. This suggests that dietary fiber supplementation may be effective in reducing blood lipids and improving fat distribution in overweight subjects. A healthy diet provides the greatest improvement in bmi and body fat proportion among overweight and obesity subjects. Further investigation into whether increased fiber consumption might provide a safer and acceptable means for treating weight loss in overweight or obese subjects. Finally, glucomannans are administered over eight weeks; however, they do not improve weight loss or change body composition, hunger, fullness, or other lipid and/or glucose parameters. Thus, alginate supplements should be used as an alternative treatment for weight loss."
15145632,"This paper discusses the use of relaxation training as an intervention for patients with Type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that a group-based stress management program may be more effective than individual therapy in improving both glycemia and blood pressure control. However, no changes are found in either glucose tolerance or general diabetic control."
16299094,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of an early-care intervention on patients with acute back pain. He concludes that it is important for physicians to be able to communicate with their patients in order to prevent future injuries from occurring. The results of this initial study suggest that there is a strong association between physical and psychological factors in patients with low back pain who are at high risk for developing chronic pain. However, Anderson does not report any reduction in work time or return to work as a result of the early intervention. Instead, Anderson suggests that these patients should be given more time to recover before they become chronically ill."
27605376,"In this paper, Anderson argues that there are several possible reasons for the low future job prospects among people on sick leave. These include: long-stuffing difficulties in the labor market; physical and mental changes during the illness; and an improved labor market during the later years. The results of this study suggest that patients with severe obesity may be at greater risk for losing their jobs after weight loss than those with healthy weight. This is due to the fact that they have more time to adjust to new work conditions and become more physically and mentally active. Anderson concludes by stating that it is important to know what causes workers to lose their jobs when they are sick. He then discusses the relationship between medical, work related, and social determinants of sickness absence. It is believed that these factors might lead to poorer employment outcomes as well as higher levels of unemployed workers."

31136527,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights discusses the use of early post-elective feeding for patients undergoing gastric resection after surgery. He concludes that early enteral feeding is more cost effective and safer than traditional methods of feeding after open bowel surgery. Furthermore, it reduces the time to recover from the operation by reducing the amount of blood lost during the procedure. This study furthermore suggests that combination of Intrvenous Metocloprapramide and Early Naogastric Tube Removal after Cysterectomy and Urinary Diversion may result in reduced post-opportunity for small bowel leakage."
18278178,"Conclusions In a large group of patients with intermittent atrial fillation, those who receive aspirin have similar risk of stroke to those with sustained af and similar risk factors. However, these patients need to be validated for their efficacy before they can be used in practice. A recent study suggests that the risk of newthrombolic stroke in older patients with acute atrial Fillation is reduced by left ventricular hypertrophy, prior stroke, and elevated blood-cholestrol levels. These results suggest that there may be an adequate secondary prevention strategy in patients with no other risk factor for stroke."
29119371,"This paper presents the results of a prospective, cross-sectional study of patients who had undergone total hip replacement. It was found that there were differences in the frequency of revisions for both causes and complications between groups. The authors conclude that use of two-mobility cups reduces the risk of discrepancy within six months. They also discuss the pros and cons of using a constrained tripolyl liner with a cementless cup as an alternative to a conventional cup. Conclusions suggest that the cup is more cost effective than other options because it has a longer life expectancy."
31684688,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, randomized, controlled trial in which subjects with Turner Syndrome were treated with hg alone or combined with Ox androlone for an eight-year period. The results suggest that GH can increase adult height in most girls with ""Turnner's syndrome"" even after puberty begins at a young age. This is important because women with typhoid secretion may not be able to gain full height until they are nine years old. However, both treatment groups have significant increases in their final height. After three years of combination therapy, subjects with TT begin to grow faster than those without TT. Although there is some evidence that ox/rolone does not cause psychological side effects, these studies do not indicate any need for further investigation."
25701331,"In this study, Wu et al. concludes that glucoganan is an effective ""cholesterol-lowering"" dietary adjunct for the treatment of overweight subjects. The addition of starch does not lead to additional weight loss; however, it does lead to a reduction in both total and lipoprotein levels. Furthermore, the combination of glyceric and glucanannan significantly reduces LDL-cholestrol concentrations in both male and female subjects."
28251861,This paper focuses on the effects of post-stroke exercise on muscle strength and function in healthy adults. It uses a mixed-effects model to examine the effect of age and gender on changes in leg strength and muscle size in older adults.
23736734,"In this paper, Conclusions and Amstar conclude that the use of gastric bypass in patients with Type 2 diabetes is safe and can be used as a treatment option for those with moderate to severe weight loss. They also report that laparoscopic Gastric Bypass has been more successful in treating Type 2 Diabetes than conventional therapy. Furthermore, there is good agreement among the authors about the efficacy of this new treatment strategy. The results indicate that severe-obsessed patients can be successfully treated with this new approach."
29520083,"In this paper, the results of a large, well-cohorted study are summarized. It does not support the hypothecy that the treatment of moderate B12 depleted subjects with anemia or signs of neurologic or mental function has beneficial effects upon later life. Conclusions There is no evidence that daily thiamine supplementation improves memory performance in elderly patients with low levels of folate. However, there is some evidence that cobalamin therapy may be more effective than other forms of anti-anemia treatment."
30050958,"The purpose of this paper is to summarize the results of a number of randomized, feigning-dissipation-based studies that have been performed. In particular, the authors present evidence for the efficacy of carnine in improving quality of life in patients with hemodylysis. They conclude by describing the main drawbacks of the study and recommending that further studies should be performed to confirm these conclusions."
22719834,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, random-experimental study on the use of olazapine as an antipsychotic for patients with schizofidal disorder. We conclude that it is safe and efficacious to use olanzepine over bupropion; however, there are significant side effects associated with both treatment regimens. Conclusions On the basis of these results, it is reasonable to conclude that switching to another drug does not lead to greater weight gain in long-term follow-up."
29292213,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of our previous studies on atorvastain and its effect on lipidemia in patients with chronic CKD. Aertastin improves lipoprotein levels but does not have any effect on blood vessel function. Both treatments reduce plasma levels of fiberinogen and pai-1 and factor VIII coagulant activities. These results indicate that both these two treatment options are capable of producing beneficial effects on endotoleal function in Type 2 diabetes. This study concludes that fibrates may be useful in reducing major cardiovascular events among persons with type 2 disease. The reduction of serum glutathianics is due to increased concentrations of IHTG rather than to an increase in total lipophosphoryl content. Furthermore, it suggests that gemfibrolizl has little effect on glucose or nefa metabolism. It also shows no effect on fasting or postpr functions in subjects with Type 2 diseases."
20739918,"This paper focuses on the relationship between back pain and lumbar spasms. It uses a double-controlled prospective trial to assess the relationships between patients with or without disc prolapse, nerve root compression, and age-related changes in their spine. The results of this study suggest that there is a strong association between low back pain caused by disc degeneration and recurring pain up to adulthood."
23959778,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a large, well-responsed trial of children with an ""autistic spectrum disorder"". We conclude that there may be a worse outcome than previously thought in children with this disorder because of their poor prognosis and limited sample size. Conclusions are made regarding the use of psychotropic medication among children with autism. Although it is common for young children to take such painkillers as sertraline, resistance to these drugs does not seem to play a role in the treatment's efficacy. The only effective treatment for autistic symptoms is haloperidone, which seems to be more effective than other antipsychotics in treating adults with post-traumatic brain injuries."
25345420,"This paper focuses on the long-term effects of morphine in children with and without treatment for ADHD. Although there is some evidence that it works, no significant changes are seen in physical health or mental health. Aripiprasole seems to be associated with improved quality of life after three months of treatment in patients with mild-to-disordered autistic disease."

In this study, subjects with a diagnosis of ADHD showed greater career driving accidents, motor vehicle violations, and worse performance on the simulator when compared to controls. These findings suggest that people with an appropriate dosage of stimulant medication may be able to reduce their driving risks. Conclusions: For adults with ADHD symptoms, our carefully constructed medication management is superior to behavior and routine community care; that includes medication. Consclusions: Our combined treatment does not yield significant advantages over medication management forcore ADHD symptoms but may have provide modest advantages for Non-Adhd symptom and Positive functioning outcomes"

29609665,"In this paper, Shyrcle argues that the use of a randomised trial as a tool to assess risk of bias in animal studies can be improved by using a new approach to predicting risk. The results of this experiment indicate that small doses of Ca do not lead to significant changes in pigs' physiology; however, it does lead to improvements in bone ash and Ca retention."
27550905,"This paper discusses the potential for reducing bias in the scientific community by attempting to conduct large-scale, i.e., unblind, prospective trials in the early days of a disease. It also discusses how this approach might be useful in reducing duplication in research and increasing the speed with which new approaches are developed."
31264084,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which reveratrol was used as an adjuvant to treat patients with Type 2 Diabetes. We conclude that it has no significant effect on blood pressure and other endometrial function in patients with high-fat diets. Furthermore, there is no change in body weight or lipoprotein concentrations in either group. Further studies need to be performed to determine whether these agents are safe and efficacious for treating Type 2D."
27898180,"In this paper, the authors present an in-vivo study comparing negative pressure irrigation to traditional needle irrigation. They conclude that there is no evidence of superiority between negative pressure and conventional needle irrigation methods. The results suggest that negative pressure can be used as a cost-effective treatment for tooth pain."
27124611,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates the use of an accelerometer to track physical activity in patients with ischemic Stroke. The results suggest that physical activity can be used to predict future events in people with sclero-regressed motor loss. This study is the first to report on the effect of a daily routine of physical activity on patients with stroke."
23002379,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of a double blinded compared study of two second generation antipsychotic agents for treating treatment-refatory patients with schizophrenia. Both treatments showed significant weight gain and improved blood fat levels in patients treated with either regimen. Although both drugs were equally good tolerated, they did have some side effects. For example, there was a greater risk of an excess dose of clozarpine than that of rosperidone; however, these side effects were not as serious as expected. A subset group of patients with mild to moderate schizophrenia may be better treated with sulpride addition to their clochapine regimen. This patient population is more likely to respond to atypical therapy than those who are resistant to conventional medicine. The effect of ""atypical"" antipsychtics in this population is modest but clinically significant. There is little difference among treatments except for the one-side lower 95 %) confidence limit on the efficacy of each treatment variable. These results suggest that clozepine and Olanzapinine have similar general Antipsychotic efficiacy. However, the differences between treatments were small: overall, significantly less o"
29228348,"In this study, Wu et al. compared the effects of two diets on blood pressure and lipids in overweight and obese patients. Both diets reduced blood pressure but did not increase gycemic or ir-indices. The results suggest that flax seeds could be an effective strategy for reducing inflammation marker such as C-Reactive Protein and Tnf-. Furthermore, both diets improved BMD scores when compared to their Western-style diets. However, there was no significant difference in severity scores between these two arms. This suggests that 1-year addition of flax seed into the diet produces a favorable effect on bloodcholesterol but does not cause any significant change in symptoms in healthy women. These conclusions suggest that Flax'seed can be used as a preventative measure against Type 2 diabetes."
27278232,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the association between alcohol and breast cancer. He concludes that there are several possible reasons for this association: 1) Estradiol is related to reduced steroid Catabolism; 2) Progesterone may be related to increased progestin levels; and 3) Menopause is more likely to occur in women with higher consumption of alcohol than in men with lower consumption. This conclusion supports the notion that drinking moderately increases the risk of developing breastcancer."

The aim of the study is to identify and characterize the effects of this treatment on patients with a psychological disorder. It is concluded that this treatment may be more effective than other antipsychotics because it does not involve significant risk of side-effects."
28126565,"Conclusions The results of this study suggest that low levels of 25-hydroxyvinamin D are associated with greater risk of heart failure in patients with high blood pressure and lipid status. Furthermore, it is concluded that vitamin D does not improve the function of older patients with chronic heart failure who have poor blood pressure or lipid profiles. In addition, confounding factors such as seasonality must be considered in future studies"
23633374,"This paper presents the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study of the use of pulse-taking and follow-up electrodes as an early intervention for atrial fillation in patients aged 55 or older. It is concluded that these methods are more cost effective than routine practice and will lead to improved detection of additional cases over time. Conclusions The majority of people with left ventricular failure are not on antithrombotics nor are they on any other treatment for stroke preventment. In addition, many primary care professionals do not correctly interpret ECGs and need to factor into the reading of electrodes by appropriate trained people. Furthermore, electrocardiography is inferior to standard 12-lead electrodes because of its superior quality. These conclusions suggest that men and women are more likely to attend fs-screening than their counterparts. However, further research needs to be done to better understand the reasons for this increase in hospital visits for attritial fibrillation since there has been significant increases in the number of deaths due to changes in risk factors. Although some studies have suggested that it may be possible to predict stroke in older people, no evidence exists supporting this claim."
28407810,"This paper uses a case-control study to examine the cost-effectiveness of a combination of community-based health workers and trained gynecologists in three different countries: India, Burma, and Laos. It concludes that the combined approach is more cost effective than either strategy alone or in other countries in India with similar health infrastructure. In particular, it suggests that the use of local health workers can reduce costs by reducing morbidity and mortality from tuberculosis."
26420598,"The relative risk of a fracture in the placebo-treated group is 1.69 compared with that found in Decalyos II, and this suggests that bone loss can be prevented by increasing trace mineral consumption. In older women, calcium and Vitamin D are more effective at preventing bone loss than either of these three treatments. However, both groups have significant differences in their performance during the first two periods of the study. For example, younger women experience greater bone loss when they receive higher amounts of trace mineral intake; older women experience less bone loss after receiving larger amounts of caiustin. Finally, we conclude that ""calcium and vitamin D"" combined reduce bone loss but do not prevent fractures in elderly women."
30746868,"The results of this study suggest that the use of a new type of surgical device, therobot, may be more effective in reducing the risk of fracture and improving leg length than conventional methods. This paper also discusses the potential for long-term use of the new device in patients with severe hip pain."
31933471,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the long-term consequences of women's ailment and discusses the latest developments in the field. He concludes that women with a history of atrial fibrillation have higher risk of death than men; however, they are also more likely to develop fatal strokes.

27395329,"This paper concludes that there are no significant differences between the search methods used in this pilot study and those found in other studies. However, it does suggest that PICO may be able to improve recall by improving brain function over a period of time. Conclusions The beneficial effects of fortification using multiple nutrients can result in improved performance in school aged children from poor rural communities. In particular, biscuits have a positive effect on impurity and morbidity; however, they do not lead to improvements in intelligence or memory."
10796331,"The relative risk for hip fracture in the placebo-treated group is 1.69, a very similar result to that reported in Decayos I. Conclusions In this study, we conclude that calcium and alpha-OHD3, combined with vitamin D, can prevent early bone loss in older women who are pregnant. Furthermore, it reduces the risk of shoulder fractures in elderly men with Parkinson's disease. All three treatments have an effect on bone mineral density; however, they do not lead to any significant changes in bone mass. For example, one patient suffers a severe hip fracture after two years of calcivitriol treatment. Both studies suggest that long-term combination therapy with either 1,25-OH)D3) or meth/ienone may be effective at preventing Osteoporia. However, both regimens fail to increase bone mineral concentrations in healthy postmanopausals. Women with low bone mass have a greater risk of falling from their hips than those with high bone density. These women also have higher risk of falls due to their reduced bone mineral content. This suggests that there may be some benefit in taking daily doses of cavitamin D rather than"
28332506,"This paper summarizes the results of a nine-month, open-label, random-access study of blood pressure control among patients with and without access to a physician's monitor. The authors conclude that home-based blood pressure monitoring can be an effective intervention for improving blood pressure in primary care settings. However, there are some drawbacks: it is not possible to track blood pressure directly; it takes time for physicians to learn how to use the new technology; and it may lead to negative psychological effects on patients. In addition, this study does not show any significant changes in blood pressure over the course of the study. Instead, it shows improvements in patient satisfaction during the follow-up period after the intervention."
28249299,"A randomized, controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of moderate to vigorous exercise for weight loss in overweight patients. In this study, Wuthering Heights's primary endpoint is that resistance training improves body composition and blood lipid levels in postmenopauseal women.

25879093,"The results of this trial suggest that the use of a patch with 300mg of testosterone daily can improve sexual function in post-menopause women. However, it does not lead to any significant changes in body composition or quality of life. In contrast, the effects of dehoep and rosterone on vaginal motility seem to be independent of the type of therapy used. This suggests that dehydroenoprogesterin may be an effective treatment for patients with syphilis. Although there is some uncertainty about the safety of this particular form of treatment, Dr. Rivers concludes that it should be used as a preventative measure against heart disease."
24464831,"In this paper, the authors present a comparison of three different types of anesthesia used for infants. The first type was epidural; the second was spinal; and the third was general anesia. These results suggest that there is little difference in short-term morbidity among the two groups but that they are more likely to experience major complications after elective Cesarion section. A free hotline telephone service provides us with estimates of major complications associated with regional anesthesia as well as details on these complications. Both groups have similar long-term outcomes. There is no difference in Post-Operative Mortality or Major Complications. However, both groups have shorter time of Amputation than General Anesthesia. This study suggests that spine anaesthesia could be used safe for highrisk infants preterm or previously preterm undergoing hip surgery. Shorter time of Accompanied Analgesis improves early Rehabilitation after major Knee surgery. Overall Patient Satisfaction was not altered by either technique. Morbidity and Type of Anesthesia did not affect the Postoperative Degradation in Geriatric Patients with Femoral Neck Fracture. Spinal Anesthesia reduces Post-Apn"

29498201,"Conclusions The results of this trial confirm that weekly cistectomy is safe and superior to rt alone in improving overall survival for patients with Indian Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma. In contrast, the addition of NAC or Xelox improves DfS in patients with advanced pancreatic malignancies. This suggests that adjuvant regimens may be more appropriate for older patients who have limited access to curative care. Conscious of age-related risk factors, it is necessary to make informed decisions regarding treatment of these patients. Adjuvant gemcitabine does not improve overall survival in cases of completely resected panceratic malignant disease. A combination of high-dose chemoradolysis and cetuximb improves long- term survival in patients without increasing the ""commonlytoxic effects associated with"" radiotherapy."

27738515,"This paper focuses on the effect of a simple, brief intervention on medication adherence for stroke survivors. In this study, patients were randomly assigned to either a fixed dose combination drug strategy with either 75mg aspirin, 40mg simvastain, 10ml lisiopril, and 50mg atenosolol or 2 or more statins. At follow-up, results showed improved adherence to medication by 86 p.m. in the Fdc group compared to usual care. There was no significant difference in serious adverse event or cardiovascular events between the two groups. Conclusions and Reneval Although use of secondary preventive drugs is low worldwide -- especially in low- income countries and rural places -- systematic approaches must be needed to improvethe long- term use of basic, inexpensive, and effective medicines."
22041335,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of two recent randomized controlled trials. First, we report that PVI significantly improves left ventricular functions in patients with atrial fist-fistula.

We find that there is an interaction between cannibinoid receptor 2 and opr1 genotypes at six-month follow up. However, it is not clear whether these two genes are associated with reduced or higher chances of abstainance from smoking. Furthermore, our results do not suggest any relationship between short-term gain and smoking Cessation. Further studies will need to be performed to further understand how these two traits may relate to each other."
27727432,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the economic burden that depression poses to European society and uses a model to predict the costs of depression. The results suggest that there are several gaps in the current knowledge about depression in Europe. For example, it is necessary to better understand the role of serotonin in depressive obstructive disease. Furthermore, further studies need to be performed in order to determine how best to treat depression in patients with mental illness. This paper also discusses the use of Same as an alternative to tricyclic treatment for patients with severe depression."
30455832,"In this paper, we describe the safety and efficacy of a new approach to treating patients with recent episode of atrial fibrillation. Concurrently, we present a prospective observational study in which we assess the safety of an electrical cardioversion as an alternative to routine admission for patients who have recently onset atrial fever. Conclusive evidence suggests that this approach may be more cost-effective than other treatment approaches."
28477308,"The results of this study suggest that exercise-based heart rehabilitation is safe and effective for patients with mild to moderate coronary disease. However, there are some drawbacks in the use of ""exercise only"" trials as they may not have sufficient power to conclude whether or not a particular exercise regimen is truly beneficial. For example, it does not seem to improve blood pressure or quality of life after 6 years of follow-up. In addition, these results suggest that women can make long-term lifestyle changes by making lasting lifestyle changes such as regular physical exercise. This conclusion supports the notion that home-based exercise training could be an effective strategy for improving health-related qualities of life and reduced risk of death."
11574449,"This paper discusses the use of local practice-based education to improve the care of patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that a patient-centered approach can be more effective than a one-on-one approach. In particular, it is suggested that using simple prompts will lead to improved compliance with the American Diabetes Association's standard of care. Conclusions That this model of ""integrated care for diabetes"" is as effective as traditional hospital care. A six-month cluster visit program reduces the number of visits per patient by improving blood glucose control and selfefficacy in adults with Type 1, but there is no significant difference in the cost of care between the two groups. Consistent evidence suggests that decision support systems should be used to assist physicians in managing their patients with type 1, although further studies need to be performed"

We conclude that these patients have relatively low risk of stroke and that they may be suitable for anticoagulation treatment. Although there is no association between age and frequency of stroke, it is clear that some patients with intermittent atrial fibrilation are at greater risk of having a stroke than others."
26501062,"Conclusions In this paper, the authors present a new treatment strategy for patients with acute low back pain that does not lead to improved work or patient satisfaction. However, they conclude that it is necessary to use a class-based approach to predict risk of adverse outcomes in these patients. They suggest using a patient perception scale as a measure of pain perception and suggests that it might be used as an aid in early identification of patients who have ""potent social risk factors"" such as depression. The results suggest that family physicians acknowledge their responsible for the difficult encounter; however, there is no evidence that treating patients with psychological distress can improve health care. A factorial  random, placebo controlled trial was conducted on patients with chronic lowback pain from January 2001 until June 2003. It consisted of 16 therapists provided by 7 physiotherapies in Australia, New Zealand and, of which six were in University teaching hospitals and one was in "

However, there are some drawbacks: the high revising rate of the procedure; the excessive amount of force required to place the instruments; and the long duration of the surgery."
30293906,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effects of combination therapy on men with mild to moderately enlarged lests. They conclude that the combination treatment is more efficacious than monotherapy in improving symptoms and quality of life when compared with either single agent. Their main conclusion is that the addition of two drugs together improves both patient's health and well-being. However, their results are not as promising as those of other studies. For example, they suggest that adding one drug to another increases the risk of U.S. urinary retention by increasing the risk among continent women. Furthermore, there is no evidence for increased risk of Urinary retention in women with excessively urinated bladders. Thus, it is recommended that these patients should be treated separately from any other treatment. The aim of this study is to determine whether or not an alphablocker/PDE5 blocker combination is more effective at treating overactive bladder in patients with moderate to severely urotoxicated lethargy."
32149404,"Congenital Heart Disease: Acute Stroke and Post-Opportunity in Infants During Conventary Heart Surgery. Conclusions The use of cavalier arrest to support central organs during chest surgery is associated with poor motor coordination, planning, and delayed neuropsychiac outcomes at age 4 years. Children with pre-existing congenital hearts are at greater risk for delayed motor development than those with normal heart disease. In infants who undergo the arterial switch procedure for correcting D-transposing the great artery, EEG and transient post-operative symptoms are associated with worse long-term outcome. Adolescence is similar between patients treated with the Hybrid procedure and those treated with Norwood; however, early neurodevelopmental results are not as high in these patients."
23360949,"This paper discusses the use of parent-training as an intervention for children with attention-deficit disorder. The results suggest that a combination of neurofeedback and behavioral training may be more effective in treating hyperactive children. In particular, it suggests that ""necessary factors"" such as selfefficacy, structure learning environment, and feeding-forward processes may also play a part in the positive behavior changes induced by EEG training. A further study is presented on nine hyperactive men who have been given several trials of artificial color food material. These subjects receive better scores than the control group on measures of their symptoms. Conclusions On the other hand, there are no significant differences among the different treatment groups in terms of how well they respond to the different diets."
27489205,"The results of this study indicate that there is no difference in cumulative survival rates for primary morals treated with the cement-restoration, art, or uct protocol over a three-year period; however, there are some differences in reasons for failure between all forms of amalgam. In particular, high-visosity glass Ionomer seems to be more cost effective than conventional restorative treatments after one year."
22992251,"The results of this study suggest that a high-strength multivitamin regimen is associated with reduced morbidity in patients with a low-folate diet. A combination of fish oil and 5-methylthambronoid reduces the risk of placental growth but does not increase the risk for omphallocele. In addition, folate use during pregnancy decreases the rate of neural tube defects. These results suggest that pregnant women should be given adequate amounts of folate before pregnancy to prevent premature birth defects."
29453672,"In this study, Wu et al concludes that n-3-fatty acids are effective in reducing body weight and improving the expression of several heptin-like genes in subjects with Type 2 diabetes. They also report that rats fed only a moderate amount of these fats showed reduced adipometic and atherogen markers. This is important because it suggests that consumption of such fats may be useful for treating Type 2 patients without compromising their sensitivity to insulin."
28063111,"In this paper, Concluson demonstrates that ablation-related brain lesions do not cause significant morbidity after the first two years of treatment. He concludes by stating that ""ablation-regular atrial lesions remain to some extent; but donot cause cognitive impairment six months later."" This conclusion is followed by a detailed description of the different methods for ablation of these lesions. The most common method used in Germany is cryo balloon, which has a higher success rate and shorter procedure time than conventional rfca. However, there are still concerns about the safety of this new technology because it may lead to long-term side effects."
30627080,"In this study, we examine the relationship between physical activity and body composition in young adults. We find that moderate to vigorous physical activity is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes than does vigorous physical exercise."
26912127,"In this paper, Wu discusses the use of the Bmse as a tool for predicting the mental state of patients in an emergency setting. The results suggest that haloperidal monotherapy is not as effective as other antipsychotic regimens because it requires immediate aggression control. Aimation control is improved over time with either combination of Li or Dvp-treated patients. Both treatment groups are well tolerated; however, they have more severe side effects than placebo. This suggests that bipolar disorder may be caused by mood-switchching. Concurrent to these findings, Quetiopine and either Li or Divalproex can be aseffective as either lazepam or midazam in treating patients with Bipolar I disorder. Although both treatments seem to be better tolerated, their efficacy depends on the severity of the patient's condition. For example, when combined with either lithium or divaproex, quetiapapine seems to be superior to lozencet in terms of reduction of psychotic symptoms. However, there are no significant differences between the two groupings after the six-week treatment period. These conclusions suggest that ""concomitant"" benz"

26806655,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a prospective, randomized, and open-label study of efficacy and safety of tamalafil in treating patients with ed and men with lumbar spasms. We conclude that it is well tolerated to treat both conditions in males who are sexually active. Both conditions show significant improvements in terms of their severity and quality of function. Tadalosin improves urinary flow by improving the ability of the patient to maintain a normal level of blood pressure. A single 20mg dose of vadenafil leads to a significant reduction in detrusion pressure and an improvement in the capacity of the cystometric instrument. This trial also shows that tantalafil can be used as a stand-in-waiting treatment for patients with lower Urinary Tract symptoms due to benign prostatichyperplasia. The effect of combination therapy appears to be even better than single agent alone; however, there is still some unmetison between the two groups."
24307487,"In this paper, the effects of alpha blockers on blood pressure are compared in patients with moderate to severe chronic artery disease. The results suggest that alphablockers can be used as an effective treatment for these patients without significant side-effects. This paper also discusses the use of beta blockers in patients who suffer from persistent claudicria. It concludes by comparing the effect of metoproll and tetamisartan on walking capacity at rest and during exercise. These results confirm that both drugs have beneficial effects on heart function."
29474713,This paper focuses on the use of short-message services to improve patient adherence to blood pressure medication. It concludes that this approach is acceptable and can be used for patients who do not have their own reminder system in place. Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy of this new form of health management.
26225902,"In this first study, Wijkstra et al concludes that the use of imipramine and fluvoxine in patients with major depressive disorder is superior to that of placebo. Although there are some confounding differences between the two groups, these results suggest that either group may be suitable for treatment of moderate-to-severe major depression. Furthermore, it is suggested that short term use of gr antagonists might be more effective in treating psychotic depression than long-term use alone. However, further studies are needed to determine whether or not certain factors contribute to early discontinuation of studies of Md.Py."
27113121,"The results of this study suggest that a combination of B-Vitamins and a steroid can be used to treat major depression in older adults. In addition, the mean score on the Beck Depression Inventory reduces significantly when compared with the placebo group. This suggests that omega-3 pfas may be an effective treatment for patients with Major Depressive disorder. However, further studies must be performed to confirm these results. Furthermore, it is necessary to perform large-scale randomized trials to determine whether or not there is a difference in the severity of depressive symptoms between the two groups."

For example, patients who receive an ICD have a higher risk of sudden death than those who don't receive shocks. We also discuss atrial fibrilation, which is associated with increased risk for fatality. This paper also discusses the use of long-time standard detection regimens to reduce the rate of ventricular recurrent events. It also suggests that older patients may be at greater risk of developing a life-threatening disease such as amystol dysfunction."

In addition, it has been reported that the use of large doses of either 1,500 or 3,000 ius/day can lead to significant increases in blood concentrations of 25-hydroxyvindol D, which is associated with increased risk of fracture. This paper concludes that there is currently no established method for evaluating the effects of either type of treatment on serum-25-OH-D concentrations as well as physical performance in athletics."
31827125,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effects of consumption of fish oils on patients with Type 2 diabetes. They conclude that diets high in n-3 and n-n-6 fatty acids may lead to reduced risk of heart disease in patients with type 2 who have a low glycerolemic load. Furthermore, their results suggest that they may be useful for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease associated with fish oil. These conclusions are confirmed by a large-scale observational study using blood samples from subjects with Type 1 and Type 2 respectively."

19300334,"The results of this study suggest that there is no difference in the morbidity of post-cesarean infection if antibiotics are given before or after skin incision. In contrast, cord clamping does not increase the risk of infection because it allows for greater passage of time for prophylactic Amicillin to enter the fetus. However, some evidence suggests that extended-spectrum Cephalospoins may be more effective than first-generation cephalosolins in reducing post-cesterian infection. Conclusions: ""Azithromycin's rapid serum half life in the term graveid woman"" with a prolong half life and high sustained antimicrobial levels noted within herometrium; adispose & placental tissul tissue. Accompanied by cefazzoin, preoperative administration reduces both endometriitis and total PostCesarean infectious Morbidity.

This paper also discusses the use of dance-video games as an exercise program for improving balance and speed in older people. It concludes that ""dual-task interference"" during walking can significantly limit mobility while increasing the risk of fall among community-dewling older adults."
28236962,"The results of this large-scale study suggest that lifestyle changes can prevent Type 2D in adults with a high risk of developing the disease. Although the sample size does not allow for significant differences in risk factors, the results are sufficient to support the evidence that ""a type 2d diabetes prevention program using lifestyle change"" is feasible and could be used in primary care settings. In addition, community health workers may be able to use the Translational Diabetes Prevention program as a strategy to reach low-suspecting populations. This paper concludes by concluding that it is possible to attain important lifestyle changes at risk for Type 2 diabetes with modest clinical effort. A brief small- group weight loss intervention did not achieve significant weight loss in subjects at risk; however, it did result in sustained lifestyle improvements and reduction in blood pressure and glucose levels. Furthermore, the intervention group improved their knowledge of diet and activity, and showed greater reductions on body mass index, waist circumferential, and diastity. Conclusions These findings warrant repeating in long term studies involving different population."

In addition, it does not reduce the frequency or severity of flare-ups in children who are already at risk for severe asthma. This conclusion should be considered as preliminary until randomized controlled trials are performed. Vitamin D is known to have an anti-inflammatory effect on asthma, but little is known about its efficacy in treating acute asthma."

22513945,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a series of randomized controlled trials on second-line ablation for parosmal atrial fistia. Although most patients are hospitalized during the year before their treatment, nearly half of them are actually treated in the year following their ablation. Conclusions Adjuvant Anterior La ablation doesn't seem to improve procedural outcome because it isn't as effective as AAD therapy at improving symptoms or quality of life; however, additional left line lesions increases the success rate greatly. CTT block reduces early postablations recurring of arrhythmics, which in majority of patients reflect a short term clinical problem. The use of pulmonary vein isolated leads to improved long-term control of AF but does not improve overall patient satisfaction. Ablation with an electrode can be more effective than conventional drug therapy in preventing new-onset left atrium complication. However, these studies do not show any advantage in longer-term maintenance of right atrium rhythm."
28851509,"Conclusions In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective, observational study of patients with severe and mildly swollen testis.

This suggests that a form of hypnosis may be an effective treatment for breast cancer patients."
31722229,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to identifying and predicting the effects of both motivational incentive and Mph on children with ADHD. They conclude that these two measures may be useful tools for restoring or restoring control over these children's behavior. Although there is no significant cardiovascular effect of stimulant medication, the results suggest that some of the symptoms of the child's condition may be alleviated by taking more potent medication."
21276215,"In this paper, the authors present a meta-analysis of 100 systematic reviews that have been published between 1995 and 2005. The results suggest that new evidence is rapidly emerging regarding the efficacy or harm of certain treatments. However, the survival time of these studies depends on many factors, including type of study, whether the original review was scientifically synthesised, and whether it included alternative or complementary medicines. To limit variation in the sample size, we focus on ""stratified review s"" of randomized, controlled trials with at least one outcome. Two members of the team independently assess eligibility for each trial by comparing the results of previous studies with those of the same topic. They use fixed effects approaches to detect changes in evidence which would warrant an update. Qualiitative signals include changes in information about harm sufficiently to affect patient decision making, significant caveats from the original results, emergent a superior alternative therapy, and important change in certainty or directions of effect. Major changes also include differing characteristics of effectiveness as well as different treatment effects. These signals capture substantive differences in how effective treatment effects are.

Conclusions AOM 400 is more effective in treating bpi-i than other antipsychotics and has a good safety record. Furthermore, it reduces the risk of relapse when compared to placebo. Conscious that patients with personality disorders are more likely to be reliant on RLAT than those without them, these conclusions suggest that RLA might be useful for some patients."
23737033,"The narrator discusses the effects of combined estrogen and progestine therapy on women in their late thirties. He concludes that it is safe and efficacious to use this form of treatment as long as there are no contraindications or contra-indications. Progestin, however, does not have any negative effects on menopause; rather, it improves sexual function by improving vaginal bleeding and atrophy. Premelle has been shown to be particularly effective in decreasing blood levels and increasing the risk of urinary incontinence among continent women. A novel transdermal Estriol ring with 50 or 100 milligs per day significantly reduces the number and intensity of varogital symptoms and improved Urogenital symptoms over a single year period. Conclusions: Transdermal Hormone Therapies were well tolerated, increased Well Being, Reduced articular Index, and increased Lumbar spine bone Dentition over one year period In Postmenopalausal women experiencing sleep disturbance resulted ingratiating with nocturnally vasomobil symptoms.

12917933,"Conclusions In this paper, we describe the effects of three different types of treatment on maternal fetal health. The first is given after the end of pregnancy; the second is given during the first hour of labor; and the third is given as soon as the baby is born. These results suggest that there may be an advantage in treating mild to moderate hypertension with either type of treatment. However, it is not clear whether these treatments will have any beneficial effects on the newborn or on the mother. This study concludes by comparing the effect of both drugs on blood pressure in pregnant women. Both groups showed significant changes in their pre-eclamptus scores. They also found no differences in the number of births attended by infants who required intermittent positive pressure Ventilation or Duration of O2 treatment. Furthermore, they found no difference in the frequency of respiratory distress among the patients treated with either combination of drugs. Finally, we concluded that antihystertensives such as alprazolol are safe and effective for controlling pregnancyinduced hypertension but do not seem to offer any advantage over non-pregnant care."
31860749,"This paper discusses the efficacy and safety of iron-deficiency treatment in a variety of patients. It concludes that it is safe and efficacious to treat symptomatic, iron deficient heart failure patients with Ferric Cargoxese over a one-year period. In addition, it suggests that this treatment may reduce the risk of hospitalization due to worsening blood flow. Two other studies suggest that FCM should be used as an effective treatment for both short-term and long-term periods of time for improving symptoms. The first study shows that IV iron can prevent acute IDA without significant side effects. The second study uses iron sucrose as a pre-treatment for patients who are iron depleted but do not have severe anemia. A newer type of iron preparation called SFG has shown great promise in treating these patients."

He concludes by stating that it is possible to use a combination of physical and psychological approaches to treat patients with back pain. These approaches lead to improved function and quality of life as well as an improvement in the cost of treatment. Anderson also suggests that women who have had breastcancer experience may be more likely to return to work after their disease has passed."
22789023,"This paper focuses on the use of weight-loss as a preventative measure for patients with psychotic disease. It is important to note that this study was not a randomised trial, and therefore does not involve any patient specificity. The authors conclude that weight loss can occur with ""cognitive"" or ""behavior""-based approaches. However, there are still some unconfirmed studies that support these claims. For example, one study suggests that a psychological intervention could be an effective treatment for weight gain in patients with schizofid disorder taking olizapine. In addition, it may improve physical well being among patients with mental illness."

21109400,"In this chapter, the authors discuss the efficacy and drawbacks of different types of pain treatment. For example, morphine does not improve post-surgery pain; however, it does improve quality of anecdote during IVRA. A six-week program of ""aquatic physical therapy"" results in less pain and improvement in physical function. The cutoff points on the pain scale provide a useful surrogate assessment of a patients' clinically important response to pain therapy."
18493163,"In this paper, the authors present a summary of the latest scientific developments in the field of periodontal disease. They describe three different types of bone loss: ankylosing and marginally irritated. The most important finding is that there is no difference in the degree of inflammation between the three groups. Both groups show higher levels of inflammatory cell transmigration than does the other two groups. This suggests that ""non-invasive"" methods such as photodynamic therapy may be useful for reducing infection. Abutment screws loosen at a reduced rate after one year. Biocompatriots are less likely to loosen when they are exposed to bacterial plaque."
22947230,"In this paper, Anderson systematically reviews the latest scientific developments in the field of childhood and adult treatment of children with and without moderate- or severe-onset forms of ADHD. He concludes that early treatment is not sufficient to prevent long-term adverse consequences from drug abuse and social outbursts. However, Anderson suggests that ""psychistimulant"" treatment may be more effective than routine community care for children with mild-to-mid-life symptoms because it does not lead to significant gains in academic performance. Furthermore, Anderson's evidence supports the use of medication as a strategy for treating children with moderate-and-severely persistent symptoms."
30022830,"Conclusions Both Atx and Pedringano result in significant improvements on ADHD symptoms, while Atx is associated with significant declines on measure of noncompliant behavior. Concluusions In this study, the combination of methadone plus pt was more effective than either drug in treating children with autism. However, it did not lead to improvement in other measures of maladaptiveness. The only difference between the two groups was that they were treated over a six-month period. This suggests that large-scale, doubleblind, placebo-control studies of pedringane in children with ASD may now be conducted"
26692005,"In this paper, we present the results of a single-arm, double-blind, rat-controlled study in which FCM was used as an effective and safe alternative to multiple low-dose iron sucrose regimens in nephrodemic patients. The main conclusions are that FCM is more efficacious than either oral or IV iron for treating iron deficitiency in non-anemic females. We also discuss the use of two different forms of iron: parenteral FeCarb and IV Ferric Carbonate. This paper discusses the benefits and drawbacks of these newer treatment approaches. It concludes that IV ferric carbonate can be used as a fast-acting iron therapy in postpartum Anemia. Conclusions Intravennous iron therapy with rh EPO significantly reduces NTproBNP levels and improves quality of life in patients with severe urine bleeding."
26717446,"Orlistat does not improve body weight or improve histopathologies. However, subjects who lose more than five % of their body weight over nine months have improved their insulin resistance and other hetological changes. An exercise training program is also beneficial in this group because it reduces the amount of fat mass that can be lost by weight loss. In addition, there are some side-effects: patients with greater weight loss lose less than 5 p.m., which indicates that they may benefit from an exercise training regimen. The greatest improvement in blood glucosin levels could not be associated with the use of these drugs because of the high number of insulin resistant subjects among this group. Furthermore, the increase in Adiponectine levels would suggest that either orlistat might reduce Type 2 Diabetes in South Pacific individuals by raising Sedentin levels. Conclusions This study suggests that orlistate has better effects on inflammatory markers than any other treatment. For example, subjects with higher body weight lose more quickly than placebo, but no significant adverse event occurs."
29776983,"In this paper, the authors present evidence for the use of a new type of hip arthrostry, called ""robotic assisted total hip"" or ""THA,"" which uses a special device to guide the surgeon through the entire procedure. They conclude that this new technology has several advantages: it can be used as a stand-in-waiting device, it reduces the risk of infection, and it improves the patient's leg length. However, the results of the study do not differ from those of the conventional group at the end of the follow-up period."

Short-term treatment with two different antipsychotics has similar effects on emotional-retrieval tasks as well as improving executive function in healthy volunteers. Although no effect is seen on negative symptoms, adjunctive use may result in local improvements in patients suffering from schizophrenia. However, larger studies are needed before recommendations for broad use can be made; results of larger controlled trials are necessary beforerecommending for broad application."
24723255,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the safety and efficacy of two different probiotics for the treatment of preterm premature infants: B-breve and Li-casei. They conclude that early gut colonies with beneficial bacteria are more effective in preventing late-onset disease than with antibiotics alone. The use of either probiotic or placebo reduces the risk of death or non-ecstasy in premature newborns. However, there is no difference in the severity of sepisis when compared to control groups. Early-onset infection remains an important problem for VLBW post-term infants; further studies need to be done to better understand the pathophysiology of brain injury among these infants. A probiotic regimen does not improve growth velocity but increases blood flow in very low-birth-women. There are no adverse effects reported on probiotic administration. Probiotic strains do not significantly reduce the incidence of enterocolonization by C or Ida species. Furthermore, they do not increase the feeding tolerance of infants who weigh less than 1000 g per day. This study was registered at scientific trials. Gov. 002910576 concluded that enteral"

27837440,"Conclusions A combination of nurse-led and physician-led intervention may improve the control of urban African American patients with Type 2 disease. Although results are clinically important, they do not reach significant significance. The intervention consists of a pragmatic, low- intensity adjunct to care provided by physicians, modestly improvement in gycemic control; but not HR quality of life or diabetes related symptoms. This intervention has been shown to be effective in improving self-reported medication adherence while not risk factor control. In addition, it does not improve blood pressure or other risk factors among African Americans who have type 2 diseases. However, there is further evidence that this approach can lead to improvements in patient health over time."

In conclusion, vaginal hypersensitivity can be prevented by use of calcinrioles or taloxes. A lower dose of thalloperic or transdermal Hormone replacement therapy does not lead to improvement in terms of blood flow or changes in vaginala atrophy. However, it does lead to worsening effects of vaginale atrophy in patients treated with either calicofene or tribunoxene. Further studies are needed to confirm this effect."

Although it is more cost-effective than conventional therapy in terms of weight loss, Anderson suggests that long-term use of gastric bypass should be considered since it can lead to significant weight loss. He also discusses other complications associated with obesity, such as hypertension, sleep deprivation, and arrhythmia. Anderson concludes by stating that ""laparoscopic BD-DS"" is an effective treatment for both type 2 and morbidly overweight patients. However, there are still some concerns about the safety of this particular procedure because of the high risk of complications."

The purpose of this paper is to present a set of guidelines for reporting on studies that use no known biases. These guideline emphasizes the reporting methods used in these studies as well as descriptions of interventional and comparison conditions. Conclusions A patient-centered approach to treating hip fractures leads to improved rates of treatment even when delivered six months after the fracture. From the physician's perspective, the intervention seems to have lead to both cost savings and gains in lifetime expectancy. This study suggests that an early preventive care service has led to considerable improvements in Ostoprasis treatment; from the health-payer's view, it appears to have been successful. However, there were still significant barriers to such treatment. An EMR message increased bone mineral density measurements and reduced the number of patients who had to be admitted for treatment. Furthermore, information-based approaches did not increase the proportion of patients being investigated for their disease. There was no effect on treatment rate. All control patients were cross over to the Ostoprorosis intervention; and all intervention subjects were given counseling regarding fall"

The results of the study suggest that consumption of 1 g of Cinnamon per day will reduce blood glucose, LDL, and totalcholesteride in people with Type 2 diabetes. Conclusions These results indicate that cinnamon may improve fasting insulin, glucose, total cholesterol, and leptoprotection in patients with Type 2, especially those with higher BMI. Furthermore, it has been reported that adding one g to the diet of subjects with type 2 does not lead to any significant changes in their health."
21059667,"In this paper, we present the results of a randomized, feigning blinded trial of pre- and post-surgery physiotherapy for patients awaiting major chest resection. We conclude that there is no indication of increased risk of complications from elective lung surgery. However, several factors are independently associated with an increased risk: age; positive cough test; periodic naogastric tubes; and duration of Anesthesia. Short-term pulmonary rehabilitation could improve exercise capacity in patients with chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease who have c and I date s to remove their lung resect for non- small cell lung disease. This study does not demonstrate any other beneficial effects between the two groups. The short- term preoperative education program did not alter function recovery or health service utilization after TKA.

This paper also discusses the use of home-monitoring devices to track blood count and predict future events."
26180255,"The relative risk of hip bone loss from a placebo-controlled intervention was 1.69 compared with an active treatment group. This conclusion is in agreement with the results of Decalyos II, and indicates that calcium and D3 together reduce senility secondary hyperpartitism and prevent hip fracture in older women. In patients with preptibetes or hypovitaminics, daily doses of high-dose vitamin D have no effect on secretion, insulinsensitivity, or development of Type 2 diabetes. However, they do lead to reduction in body weight and fat mass among overweight and obese females. Women who are very low incalculable in their diets can benefit from increased physical activity; however, these effects are not associated with changes in blood pressure or lipoprotein content. These studies will need to be performed in larger populations of subjects with either type 2 or type 3 diabetes."

29718689,"In this paper, we describe the results of a three-month weight loss program in patients with Type 2 Diabetes. Both diets result in significant weight loss and improvement in blood pressure. A low-fat, high-molecular diet is more effective than a conventional low-favorite diet in terms of weight loss but also improves several risk factors for heart disease. We conclude that both diets have beneficial effects on weight loss as well as on other risk factors. For example, a Mediterranean diet reduces blood pressure by reducing Urinary Excretion and Blood Temperature. This suggests that an alternative approach may be more successful in treating hypertension because it does not involve excessive activity."
31367297,"In this paper, we present a novel approach to evaluating the efficacy of short-term statin treatment in patients with Type 2 Diabetes. We demonstrate that it is possible to use simvastain as an effective anti-oxidative stressant by reducing taurine levels and improving lipoprotein profiles in subjects suffering from Polyneuropathies. Furthermore, we suggest that taurine might play a key role in the improvement of lipid profile during lipid reduction therapy. All three treatments reduce LPO significantly; however, they do not show any significant differences between these three groups. Conclusions: Short-term ""lipotropic"" or ""cholesterol-lowering"" drugs are more effective than monotherapies in treating hypercholestremic patients. They also show no significant changes in plasma F1+2 levels after 10 days. Consequences: These results seem to be due to the HMOx1-inducible effect of Atorva Statin. Vitamin E does not affect the lower lipids obtained by Atorvastin but does increase the antioxidant activity of vitamin E when given in combination with sim vastatin. Finally, conclusive evidence suggests that sim"
24977635,"In this paper, the authors present a comparison of the efficacy of epidal analgesis and general anessia in terms of post-operative complications. Although pain scores are lower in the Epidural group, this does not translate into faster recovery of bowel functions or earlier discharge from the patient. There is no difference in the Intr-Operative course of Post-Opportunity Mortality between two groups; the General Anaestry group shows a greater mortality than the Spinal group. However, there is little difference in number of complications during the first two months of the surgery. The only advantage of local anaesthesia was a short time for ambulation as well as a longer time to ambulate. Both groups report similar morbidity after acute hip surgeries under either type of anaestical technique. Mammary hemodynamics are similar among the two groups, but they do not show any differences in the severity of their injuries. They conclude that EA exerts a significant benefit on operative outcomes in patients with high risk surgical conditions."

We conclude that despite the short-term nature of the trial, it is clear that atomoXetine is highly efficacious in treating children with an extended period of follow-up. For each assessment point, we define evidence from the Medical Translation of Appropriate Uses for Adolescents and interpret the serial presentation of findings at various assessment points with different definitions of long- term effects. Finally, we discuss some practical suggestions about how to use stimulant medicine and behavior therapy as part of the treatment of kids with ADHD."

The results suggest that all three approaches are effective: 1) Isf and Mm; 2) Fortified foods; and 3) Folic acid. Children with Type 1 or Down's Syndrome receive more folate than those with no folate. In addition, there is a significant association between folate levels and blood pressure in both groups."
16034862,"In this paper, Wound Irritation and Post-Appendicectomy complications are investigated in a general hospital. A single dose of metirondazole does not significantly reduce the risk of infectious complications in patients with acute appendictis. The authors conclude that it is inappropriate to use cefam or ole as prophylaxes in children because there are no side effects due to these antimicrobials. They also suggest that topical ammonium Bromide should be used when wound contamination is hard to avoid. Woundirrigation with 1 percent cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium bromide did not prevent wound infection in any grade of disease. This study seeks to determine in an district general hospital how frequent and nature of pathogens at operation were; b. the incidence of subsequent infection and c. whether interparietal PovidoneIodine was effective against post-appropendicectomy wound infection. It was suggested that Intrreparal metronidarazole, when used solely, is not enough for effective prosophical effect on appendicitic diseases in childhood.

Conclusions Amstar has good agreement, reliability, construct validity, and feasibility; these conclusions need confirmation by more diverse assessors. In addition to medical treatment, specific exercise therapy may be more efficacious in relieving low-back pain than medical management alone."
25746842,"In this study, we find no statistically significant changes in any measure of the change in blood glucosin levels between the two groups. There were some significant within- group changes detected. Further research is needed to determine whether an EGCG-rich decafinated Gte will provide any benefits in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes. This study concludes that Cinnamon supplementation does not improve entire body insulinsensitivity ororal glucose tolerance; it does not modulates blood lipid profiles in post menopausals with type 2 diabetic patients. The results suggest that Greek physicians are rich sources of anti-disease and antioxidants. Oral supplements of reveratrol seem to be effective for improving gycemic control but do not improve blood sugar control in subjects with Type 1 disease. A year intervention with Flavan-3-Ols and Isoflavenes improved Biomarkers ofCVD risk by highlighting the addition of flavonides to standard drug treatment in managing VD risk in Postmenopousal Type 2 patients. Furthermore, these studies need to be further validated before further large trials can be carried out. Finally, our study suggests that cinnamon"

Conclusions That treatment with congenial endogeneity does not increase risk of stroke in women with pre-menopause menopause. However, it does increase the frequency of Mammography follow-up by a significant amount. Women who started using corticotine therapy soon after they were pregnant had similar results for heart disease and stroke but did not improve mammography scores. These conclusions should be taken into account in decision making about postmenopropausal regimens. Estrogent plus proprastin is associated with lower risks of thrombosis and total mortality as well as reduced risk of cholestrel disease. This evidence supports the use of statin to reduce risk of coronary disease in women treated with this type of therapy.

It concludes that there is no linear association between drinking coffee or sugared drinks and increased risk of heart disease in children. However, it does suggest that sweeteners may help to improve glucose secretion in humans. In addition, fruit drinks are associated with an elevated risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus among African-American women. Furthermore, studies have shown that sweetened drinks reduce body weight by delaying satiating signals from previously eaten foods. A 1,500-kcal daily diet was as effective at preventing overweight youth from gaining excessive body weight as a less restricted snack policy. Children were also found to drink less milk than recommended for adults; however, they did not increase their total energy intake."

However, the present trial was observermasked only, and therefore no improvement in subjective symptoms or other parameters in either group could have been expected. Oral fat capsules are more effective in treating dry eyes than warm eyedrops. The use of an anti-IL-1 antagonist appears to be a novel treatment for patients with diated delusions. In addition, topical Csa 0.05 %) twice daily may improve tear film stability by improving tear cell stability.

Conclusions In the large population of patients with moderate to high risk for stroke, it is not possible to predict which group will be most likely to benefit from antithrombotic therapy. For example, older patients with atrium fibrillation may have a greater risk of having a stroke than younger patients who do not have this risk. This paper suggests that women are more likely to develop a new type of stroke due to their female sex. It also suggests that men over 75 years old should be considered ""high risk."""

He also discusses the possible role of pathogenetic factors, such as age and hypertension, in predicting future events. Conclusive evidence suggests that RIA can be more serious than generally believed; even one can lead to permanent psychological dysfunction. Consistent results suggest that atorva statin reduces stroke and blood vessel thrombus in older patients with moderately high levels of cholesterol. However, these results do not support the use of statin as a secondary preventive measure."

The authors present evidence for the efficacy of three-lead pulse-taking as an effective and cost-effective means of early detection of atrial fillation in patients over age 65. They also describe the use of electrocardiography to identify risk factors for atrial Fibrillation. Although men are more likely to attend fs-screening than women, this is partially explained by social and economic differences. Conclusions In addition, there is a significant increase in hospital visits for atrium fibrillation due to changes in medical practice. Stroke was associated with elevated blood pressure but did not result from age or heart disease. Nurse-led education was particularly effective in preventing stroke. A nurse-led program would be especially beneficial since it would lead to earlier identification of patients who might benefit from anticoagulation."

30921478,"In this paper, the results of a meta-analysis of 370 drug trials are summarized. A majority of these studies were funded by non-profit or for-profit organization, and most were double blinded. The main outcome was whether the experiment was recommended as ""treatment of choice"" in either group. Trials funded by both types of organizations were more likely to suggest that the experimental drug should be used as treatment than those funded by for profit organization. This association does not appear to reflective treatment effect nor adverse events. However, it is suggested that trial funds may be less likely to recommend such an intervention than trials funded by other sources. Alprasolam appears to be better tolerated in short term treatment of patients suffering from panic disorder. Although there are no significant interactions between medication and present major depression on measures of general improvement, we conclude that neither alprazolum nor imipramine could be equally effective in treating depression in patients who suffer from severe Major depression. Both drugs improve symptoms but do not lead to any changes in patient's health. These results indicate that some patients may need less than 6 milligrams per day for efficacious treatment of panic disorders. Conclusions These results emphasize a gap among pharmac"

17285783,"In this paper, we describe the effects of tyrannical androgen replacement on healthy older men with elevated levels of serum T. The results suggest that short-term tetraviral therapy may improve body composition, muscle strength, and cardiac endurance in elderly men with low levels of T. Although there are beneficial effects for gh or sex treatment, some adverse effects occur after 26 weeks; further studies are needed to determine whether these benefits can be extended to older patients with low test levels"
25392297,This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on the efficacy and drawbacks of various approaches to improving the management of patients with Type 2 and low-literate patients. The main aim of this study is to determine whether or not self-management practices can be used in developing countries.
29420704,"Conclusions and Reneval In patients with high risk aortics who are at elevated surgical risk, transcathet heart valve replacement is superior to the use of an earlier generation prosthesis. This new device, the Venti Valve, has been shown to be safe and efficacious in these patients. Conscious of the potential for long-term safety, convulsions, and early mortality associated with this new technology, we recommend that it be used as a first-generation device rather than a second-generation one."
29596495,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft demonstrates the efficacy of a group-based approach to treating patients with Type 2 diabetes in a small rural setting. The results suggest that pharmacists should be more effective than generalists when it comes to improving blood pressure control. A case management intervention is also shown to have significant effects on older adults with type 2 disease. This study concludes that an ""integral health management model"" can improve behavior change and Glycemic controls in Chinese with Type 1 disease. However, there are still unreconciled differences between the two groups regarding patient adherence to treatment and risk factor reduction."
24698343,"In this paper, we describe the effect of a high-fructose diet on insulin sensitivity and lipolysis in healthy subjects. We conclude that it is likely that low-dose FFCse might be involved in the pathos of Type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, our results suggest that consumption of large amounts of sugar may lead to changes in body fat composition."

The authors conclude that there is sufficient evidence for the use of active strategies to improve patient outcome and quality of care. However, there remains some unmet need for further evidence in the field."
28942899,"This paper focuses on the use of evidence-based practice approaches to improve physical therapy practices in patients with lower back pain. It uses a case-control study to assess the efficacy of an 8-day course of didactics and self-reporting methods for improving patient adherence to treatment goals. The results suggest that continuing education may be more effective than peer assessment in improving patient outcome. However, it does not improve outcomes for patients who have a long-term risk of developing a permanent disability."

30627441,"In this paper, the authors present a new approach to treating scars by using a combination of fractional and molecular light wounding. They conclude that both methods are effective in treating moderate to severe scars with little downtime. The authors suggest that FPS may be useful for some patients with enlarged pores because it can be used as a ""new treatment algorithm"" in some cases. Conclusions Atrophic scarring is an extremely common problem, which can lead to significant psychological morbidity. multiple types of treatmentsare used against acne Scarring"
24841177,"In this paper, Anderson systematically reviews the evidence for the use of strength-training as an effective treatment for knee ostearthritis. He concludes by describing the relationship between strength and pain in adults with knee ostoliarity. He then discusses the role of exercise in improving patients' health. He uses a patient-reporting scale to track changes in physical function over time."
12804458,"In this paper, we describe the effects of an interdisciplinary intervention on patients with Type 1 and Type 2 who have been hospitalized for at least one year. The results suggest that there may be some drawbacks in the use of group-based education to improve patient self-reporting of their health status. We also discuss the effect of a home-based management program on children with newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes. At one year's follow-up, the change in weight loss is less than that of the control group; however, it does not increase social costs. This study concludes that home care can result in improved metabolic control and improved quality of life among newly diagnosed Type 1 patients. All primary care physicians attend annual diabetes care seminars and undergo peer reviews of theiradherence to published standards."
27374001,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates that patients who undergo total hip replacement demonstrate significant pain relief after the test of the Tug test. The results suggest that early post-opportunity therapy can be used to reduce the risk of dislocation and improve patient satisfaction. A reduction in restriction does not increase the rate of dislocation following total hip surgery. However, it does promote lower costs and is associated with higher levels of patient satisfaction at later stages of recovery."
28589531,"One year of physical activity changes in patients with Type 2 diabetes are able to lead to improvements in their health and behavior. A brief intervention, ""integrated lifestyle counseling,"" is shown to be more effective than usual care in improving Hba1c levels. This suggests that the combination of self-management education and group exercise can be used as a preventative measure against type 2 disease."
29219092,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the relationship between early childhood exposure to physical and mental health risk factors. He concludes that parents should be encouraged to make informed decisions about their children's exposure to the various kinds of media. Children who are exposed to more than three hours per day have a greater risk of developing Type I and Type II motor skills later in life. This paper also discusses the importance of early childhood education as an important strategy for preventing overweight and obesity among young children. Anderson concludes by stating that it is important to encourage parents to allow their children to watch at least some amount of time with their children before they reach adulthood. Although there is no direct relation between these two activities, further research is needed to determine whether or not certain lifestyle risk factors can be associated with such behavior."
30388164,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights focuses on the effects of a walking program and physical activity intervention on women's health. The results suggest that an improved walking program may be more effective in reducing overweight and obesity than other measures. Walking is also associated with reduced risk of being physically active but not at all harmful to health. This paper discusses the use of step counts as a tool for evaluating physical activity programs."
26164054,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the evidence for the use of benzazepines as an effective treatment for traumatic brain injury. It is clear that sedation can be used as a preventative measure against further stress-induced changes in the patient's health. However, there is no advantage to using d-cyphoserine or other anti-invasion drugs in treating psychiatric patients with recurrent traumatic experiences. We conclude that these studies are important because they will help us better understand how patients are treated after traumatic events."
22079932,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of two recent studies. The first is a novel preventive intervention to improve health among older adults at a lower cost than traditional midwifery visits; the second is an evidence-based approach to improving children's health in low- and middle-class neighborhoods. We conclude by concluding that there are no significant differences between the intervention group and the control group on self-rated health, functional status,quality of life, and changes with self-report problems. This study suggests that social support can be used as a strategy to reduce youth violence. However, it does not lead to improved health for older people who have poor health."
23739312,"This paper reviews the evidence for the efficacy of a family-based, web-based approach to treating depression. It concludes that this intervention is highly effective in preventing relapses and improving patients' quality of life. In addition, it reduces the number of patients with depressed symptoms who require additional treatment."
19148113,"This paper focuses on the effects of early childhood intervention on preterm and very low birth-wealth infants. It concludes that early care can improve children's mental and physical health at an early age. In addition, it suggests that early education may be more cost effective than conventional care in terms of improving brain development. However, this study does not show any improvement in long-term outcomes for prematurely weighed babies."

24099581,"This paper focuses on the effects of falls on patients with multiple symplified myosis. It uses a case-control study to examine the relationship between functional ability and risk of falls in subjects with chronic motor failure. The results suggest that there is a high frequency of falls among individuals with multiple SCIs, but it does not predict whether they will fall or not."
28202713,"Conclusions A daily dose of 1,000 IU of high-dosing vitamin D does not reduce the severity or frequency of acute outbreaks of rheumatric fever in patients with severe deficiencies. This is due to the fact that they are more likely to suffer from severe disease than those with normal levels of blood. In addition, confounding evidence suggests that higher doses of vitamin D may be more effective in preventing such serious events as fractures and falls."
26777297,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of a prospective observational study on patients with schizophrenia. We found that there was a greater risk of relapse from heavy drug use than from moderate or less frequent use. This suggests that continued use may be an effective strategy for reducing the risk of developing a severe psychotic disorder. However, we do not find any association between increased or continued use of cannabinol and the severity of the disease. Furthermore, it does not seem likely that continuing use will lead to improved mental health in these patients."
28919929,"In this study, we examine the effect of a short-term exercise intervention on motor function. We find that there is no association between pre-exercise growth factor levels and changes in other growth factors for older adults. This suggests that exercise may be an effective strategy to reduce the risk of falls in older people. However, it is not possible to have one exercise prescription for all older adults because each person's physical abilities are different. Therefore, ""the concept of whatconstituted moderate.. was determined by the physical capacity of each individual."" Furthermore, age-related declines in motor performance occur with increasing age."
20374659,"In this paper, we present the results of a large-scale, cross-examination study on the safety and efficacy of mogenbustion in treating patients with a variety of different diseases. We conclude that there are few controlled trials available to support the use of such an effective form of treatment for patients with specific diseases. However, we do have some evidence that it can be used as a preventative measure against certain types of disease."
27082571,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a large-scale, long-term observational study. We conclude that hypertensives in patients with high blood pressure confer highly significant and practical reductions in both mortality and morbidity as well as total mortality. This is particularly important for stroke patients who are at high risk of developing a stroke. Furthermore, it was first reported that an anotensin Type 1 receptor antagonist could be used as a preventive measure against secondary stroke. The main conclusion from this study is that ""eprosaran compared with Nitrendi pine for secondary prevention"". However, these studies do not provide any concluding evidence regarding the efficacy or safety of either treatment."
27495104,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the efficacy of probiotic treatment for children with a history of severe gastrointestinal and/or respiratory tract infections. He concludes by describing the results of a double-blind, randomised, long-term study in which Lactobacilus GG was found to reduce the incidence of acute olithoprimary disease in children who attended day care centers during their first three years of life. This is important because it provides evidence that ""psychialists can be useful at underst or predicting clinical behavior."" However, further studies are needed to confirm these conclusions."
28459121,"The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study of older adults who have been driving for at least three years. This population includes elderly French women, older American Indians, and older Alaskan Native Americans. In particular, we examine the effect of age, health, vision, physical performance, and speed of processing on risk of driving Cessation. We conclude that slower speeds of processing are significant risk factors even after taking baseline driving, age, medical condition, vision; and physical performance as considerations. Conclusions In older patients who had been hospitalized, the Speed Passage Balthasar test was useful in prognosing future crashes. However, it did not provide any specific information about driving cessations. A driving simulator could be used to screen out unsafe older drivers prior to a more expensive road test. Although many older adults continue to drive because of their physical frailties, many choose to continue with their daily activities."
29392334,"Post-operative exercise results in significant improvements in pain and function after resection of lung disease. In addition, patients with pulmonary disease often fail to attend the post-oppressive treatment at home. This suggests that an exercise program may be a good strategy for improving patient's health following thoracolectomy."
29762708,"This paper uses a case-control study to examine the effects of a cash transfer program on school attendance and sexual activity in three low- income countries: Burkinago, Kenya, and South Africa. The results suggest that unconditional cash transfers may be more effective at improving school attendance than other forms of public health intervention. In particular, the CCT has a lower incidence of repeating their previous school grade; however, it does not appear to have an immediate impact on reducing sexual activity or early marriage among poor households. More specifically, there is a reduction in the number of hours children spend working each week as a result of this program's poverty-relieved objective. Overall, these findings suggest that ""poor- targeted unconditional cash transfer schemes"" may have potential spillover benefits for improved health outcomes in terms of combating HIV risk among African young people."

30151552,"Conclusions This paper provides evidence that physical therapy is more effective than cranial bracing in patients with chronic fatigue. Although it is recommended that this treatment be extended to other patients, it is necessary to compare the efficacy of these two approaches in order to determine whether they can be used as part of a total treatment regimen for patients with congestive fatigue."
31337389,The aim of this study is to assess the effect of a paleolithic-based diet on weight loss and other anthropometric measures in patients with Type 2 diabetes. This paper uses a mixed-effects meta-analysis to identify the effects of the paleolinic diet on subjects with type 2 disease.
27157250,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to preventing and reducing the risk of heart disease in patients with moderately high cholesterol levels. They describe a combination of antaranthin, astaxanhin, red- yeast extracts, florc acid, and astaxantehin that has been shown to have anti-dysphosphorylating and anti-hyperglycation effects. This new approach is particularly promising because it can be used to prevent or delay Type 1 and Type 2 atheritance."
21791456,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the association between exercise training and risk factors for heart disease in children. He concludes that exercise training reduces blood pressure but does not improve any of the measures of adipokinin or the markers of systemic stress. This suggests that physical training may have an important role in preventing heart disease from reaching adulthood. Anderson also discusses the use of short-term exercise as a preventive measure against atheroscomatose heart disease. The results of this study suggest that regular exercise can be beneficial to both men and women. However, it is not clear whether these effects are due to weight loss or changes in body composition."
24314347,"In this paper, the first results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study are presented. They describe the use of cluster-level and mixed-effects thresholding to predict changes in brain function in patients with ADHD. The results suggest that there is a strong association between dopamine increase in ventral prefrontal cortice region and the effect of methylphini date on treatment of ADHD. Furthermore, both drugs lead to normalization of frontopranoleptic symptoms in children with mild-to-dose attention disorder."
27150167,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft demonstrates the efficacy of a patient-centered, evidence-based approach to treating patients with spondering shoulder fractures. The results suggest that a multi-faceted approach may be more cost effective than a one-time education intervention. However, it does not lead to significant changes in physicians' behavior toward treatment. Furthermore, there is little evidence for the effectiveness of physician education in improving care for patients with back pain."

25380104,"The results of this study suggest that the presence of a reduced flow of CSF to the brainstem may lead to improved response to posterior decompression. This is supported by the use of cine phase contrast MRI and long-term follow-up studies. All patients show significant improvement in health, physical function, and outcome after surgery. Conclusions Both methods are effective for reaching the goal of decompressed surgery for cm-I malformation. However, there is a persistent blockage of caustic cerebellar tubules which leads to spinal cord dysfunction. A new surgical procedure restores these pathways and reduces the pain associated with acute syreinx treatment."
24146670,"Conclusions MTA shows a higher long-term patient and laboratory success rate than formsocresol, but does not induce unwanted responses. After 6 months of pulpotomie with MTA, the results suggest that MTA is a good alternative to formo Cresol for treating primary moral teeth."

The first is a modified version of the original Consotment document, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in February of 2009. In this paper, we examine the effect of the presence of silver-coated sealers on the healing of bone tissue. We conclude that both methods can be used to treat patients who have been treated incorrectly."

The treatment does not affect language orglobal ratings of social function and communication; more studies need to betterunderst and/or whether treatment effects might be improved by increased intensity and durationof the treatment. In addition, this study suggests that short term parent-medicated intervention can have important changes in core impairments for children with Autistic Spectrum disorder."
27778435,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, fessive single-blind, rat-controlled trial of Ide-033, a topical anti-inflammatory drug for knee pain. It shows that both formulations are superior to placebo in terms of pain relief and improvement in joint function. This is important because it will allow us to make informed decisions about how best to use these drugs in practice."
27568654,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft uses a statistical model to predict the risk of developing high-risk or intermediate-risk prostate disease. He concludes that it is possible to use  Kallikrein marker as a surrogate marker for men with advanced or low-risk disease in order to reduce unnecessary biopsys while delaying diagnoses of high-grade cancers in some men. The results suggest that short-term antigen therapy may be an effective treatment for patients with moderately elevated PSA levels. Adenocarcanoes are more likely to die from these types of tumors than from other forms of treatment. Prostate specific antigen testing has been shown to be more effective than open-bawdy regimens; however, there are still concerns about its efficacy and long-term survival. Furthermore, several studies have suggested that early-stage prostatic disease might be better treated with targeted molecular therapy."

The results suggest that this treatment can be used to treat children with an ""autistic spectrum disorder"" and that it may lead to improved social functioning."
28236127,"In this paper, the authors present a set of evidence-based approaches to improving the management of patients at high risk for fractures. They describe a group-based education program that improves knowledge about the disease and reduces the frequency of treatment. A randomised trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a community-based approach to treating patients with Ostoprasis. The aim of the trial is to determine whether an intervention consisting of self-management classes can be more effective in reducing the risk of fractures in older women."
27378255,"This paper focuses on the relationship between physical activity and health in pre-Kindy children. Preschool age children are less physically active than younger children because of their history of asthma, wheezeing, or other childhood illnesses. The results suggest that early childhood education needs to be focused on increasing physical activity for young children. Children who spend more time at school have lower physical activity levels than those who spend less time at home."
20969769,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, cross-sectional study of older adults with hip fracture who received an appropriate amount of treatment for their condition. We find that there is a lack of information on how to prevent these fractures in the family setting and that most patients do not receive adequate care after their fractures. A case manager is used to increase the frequency of bone mineral densibility testing and filling orders for Osteoporoseis medication. This intervention does not lead to better outcomes than usual care. However, it does lead to improved rates of treatment when physicians are involved. For example, a patient with a low hip bone mass has a greater risk of developing a new fracture because of its higher bone mineral content. Conclusions furthermore suggest that improving bone mineral density can help predict future fractures by predicting which fractures will be more likely to occur."
14670881,"The results of this study suggest that there is no indication for a significant difference in the severity of post-opportunity pulmonary complications between groups. Conclusions: For non-cardiac surgical patients, previous studies have focused on cardial risk. This study suggests that chest physio therapy may be useful as a preventative measure against these complications. However, it is concluded that early postoperative pneumonia is likely caused by colony of the respiratory tract prior to surgery and that prophylactic antibiotic treatment does not reduce the risk of acquiring a pulmonary infection. Consciousness and Discussion In this study, we examine the effect of airway pressure on lung function after convalescent angioplasty. We find that ""non-invasive ventilation with continuous positive airways pressure"" is better tolerated than ""blow bottle"" or ""hypertensive breathing."""

Several other studies have suggested that long term use of estrogen may be more effective than short-term use; however, these studies do not provide any evidence for the safety or efficacy of long-term treatment."
20715299,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the costs of depression in European society. They conclude that there are several important issues to be addressed in order to improve the quality of life in Europe. For example, ""better detection, prevention, treatment, and patient management"" are necessary for improving the health of people suffering from depression. Furthermore, they identify several gaps in the current literature on depression. These gaps relate to the use of evidence-based approaches such as self-reporting and observational studies."

23235671,"This paper discusses the benefits of psychological treatment for patients with depressed symptoms. It is argued that psychotherapy can be beneficial in these patients because it helps them to adjust to their new environment and improve their quality of life. However, there are some drawbacks: side effects are more frequently reported than placebo, and both drugs have different side effects. In particular, they are associated with worse side effects than either drug group. The study concludes by comparing the tolerability of Zimeldine as well as an earlier study using mapsrotiline which showed no superiority to amiriptyline when compared to other anti-depressant regimens. A comparison between paroxetine and tricyclic Antidepressants was made. Both were better tolerated but did not show any significant change in performance on the Hamilton scale. They also showed little difference in weight change after one month's treatment."
28635182,"In this study, Wuthering Heights compares the effects of a diet enriched with flax seeds to that of an ally-rich diet. Both groups show significant reductions in total cholesterol, LDLcholesterol, and other markers of inflammation. Flax seed also reduces blood lipid levels but does not affect insulin sensitivity or fasting glucose. Furthermore, it does not alter the level of inflammatory markers in patients with Type 2 diabetes."
31768318,"In this paper, Conclusions demonstrates that transcutaneous nerve stimulation is safe and effective for treating children with bladder overactiveness. Urotherapy alone seems to be more effective than tens in treating children who have overactive bladders. However, there is a tendency for differences between the two groups when compared to children without prior treatment. Conscious of the need for larger numbers of patients, further studies are needed to confirm these results."
28941967,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to early treatment of patients with distal radal fractures. They report that patients who follow an ""accelerated rehabilitation protocol,"" which emphasizes movement immediately after cast removal, have an earlier recovery than those who follow more standard rehabilitation methods. This approach is especially beneficial for patients with deformed fingers and other complications. The results of this trial are published in the journal of the medical ethics committee of the university of Tubingen. However, there is no improvement in wrist extension or grip strength after six weeks of immobilation. A randomised study found no significant differences between the two group's functional parameters at one as well as three months after the injury. These results suggest that early mobilisation may be a good treatment option for these patients. Early mobilization does not improve arm function; however, it does result in improved strength and range of motion during the period of twelve-week post-fracture. Conclusions That early mobilization seems to be safe and effective for quickly recovering the physical ability and performance ofthe injured arm rather than being conventionally immobilized following a fracture. After a minorly displaced convalescent humerous fracture, immediate physio therapy produces"
24862702,"In this paper, the results of an endodontic study are presented. It is concluded that the use of an electroded pex-locator as part of an extended periodontal treatment can reduce the need for additional diagnostics by reducing the amount of time required to calculate working length."
22071397,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the efficacy of an after school team-soccer program to prevent overweight children from becoming physically active. It uses a mixed-race, white-and-black sample to examine the relationship between physical activity and energy use in African American girls and black women. The results suggest that sport can be used as a preventative measure against overweight and childhood obesity."
23369854,"In this paper, Conclusions demonstrates that the Alere Net system is superior to other heart failure devices in its ability to predict changes in a patient's blood pressure and thus prevent unnecessary outpatient visits. He concludes by stating that use of an ""impestorable diagnostic tool"" to track impedance does not improve outcome or increase heart failure-related hospitalizations. Further studies need to be performed on how best to use these newer devices to manage patients with chronic heart failure."
28447854,"This paper discusses the protective effects of a Mediterranean-based diet on blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and body weight. It concludes by arguing that ""snacking habits"" can be used to explain unhealthy snacking behavior. In addition, it shows that willingness to taste is related to individual differences in how children respond to food rewards. Conclusions The results suggest that eating with self-regulfing training can increase its effectiveness over long term behavior change."
24749160,"In this chapter, we discuss the effects of stimulants on neuropsychological and psychiatric functions. We examine how different doses of drug can lead to different effects on brain function. For example, when used at high doses, it seems to be more effective in treating attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder than when it is used at low doses. This paper also discusses some of the other possible side-effects that might be associated with using stimulants in patients with ADHD."
27997982,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed description of the effects of different types of bleaching agents on enamel. They conclude that it is possible to alter the ""middleness"" and ""roughness"" of tooth enamel by using different methods. For example, fluoride can be used as a post-bleacher in order to prevent absorption of stain while at-home or in-office lightening can reduce the hardness of despised lesions. All treatments affect the enamel's surface, but only the use of hydrogen peroxe does. Two weeks later, however, all the group that received fluride shows a significant improvement in the micromorphology of the enamel. After two weeks, both groups receiving fluorides show an increase in the extent of the change in the enamel; these changes are reversed within three months after treatment. Bleaching with 35 % carbami peroxide results in insignificant effects on surface mohardness. This study also suggests that there may be a tradeoff between cost and ease of use when selecting the right type of solution for each patient."
26655787,"This paper focuses on the effects of weight loss and exercise on type 2 diabetes, particularly in patients with high-risk disease. It concludes that physical activity is an effective intervention for improving gycemic control but does not lead to improved blood pressure or other measures of control. The results suggest that lifestyle changes may have limited effects on some typical control factors, but do result in improvements in stroke incidence in people with established Type 2"
17356688,"In this paper, we describe the results of a study on children with epilepsy who received either a single-drug pacifism or a combination of two different drugs. The efficacy was found in both groups; however, there was a significant difference in seizure frequency between the three groups when compared to those treated with placebo. Children were more likely to have seizures after receiving either hypobarbiton or mephobbital than before. This suggests that although most children do not have serious side effects from these two drugs, they should be given at least a year's time for them to reduce their negative effects. After twelve months, most parents can't distinguish between hypometabbel and placebo. However, our results suggest that it is acceptable as a ""first-line drug"" for childhood epilespsy in rural settings in developing countries because of the marked change in the patients' behavior after one year of treatment. Furthermore, according to the Abbott Parents Questionnaire, there does not appear to be any significant improvement in behavior with either Aeds or pills first. These results are important because they provide evidence of an antieproileptic drug target Polymorphis"

The results indicate that there is little difference in the leakage between groups at different depths. However, it is suggested that the presence of the second layer may reduce the amount of leakage by inhibiting the growth of pathogens."
22895954,"In this study, a reduction in stroke incidence occurs when specific blood pressure goals are reached. The aim of the study was to reduce the risk of stroke by reducing the frequency and severity of strokes occurring in older patients with high blood pressure. Although there is some evidence that lossartan may be more effective than atenonelol, it has not been shown to have any effect on the rate of major cardiovascular events among older adults with hypertension. There is no significant difference between blood pressure measured by one minute and three minute time intervals; however, several studies have suggested that certain lifestyle changes may lead to increased blood pressure levels. These results suggest that treatment of mild hypertension should be considered as a primary preventive measure rather than a curative intervention."
32292049,"In this paper, Wulliver focuses on the acute effects of coffee consumption on blood pressure. He concludes that it is beneficial for both short-term and long-term use because it can lead to protective effects against cardiovascular disease."
31522379,"A randomized, controlled trial comparing the effects of diet and exercise on weight loss and body composition in moderately-obsessed men. The results suggest that a high-protein, low-calorie diet can lead to significant weight loss in overweight and obesity-prone women. In contrast, studies have found little evidence for the efficacy of exercise alone or with weight loss. For example, one study has found no effect on blood pressure after only a few weeks of exercise. However, this does not appear to be a good strategy for reducing body weight."
32162242,"ImPACT, a self-reporting anxiety test, is superior to other post-injury measures in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Concussions are particularly dangerous because patients report their own symptoms after the injury. Brain scans can be used to track changes in brain health over time."
17526675,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to evaluating the efficacy of exercise-training in patients with obstrutal disease. They conclude that exercise training can restore some of the damage caused by lipotoxication and that it may be used as a preventive measure against further injury."
26732899,"This paper focuses on the use of force-insensitivity surface EMG measurements to predict back pain in patients with low trunk extension. It is important to note that this study has not yet been published, so it will be necessary for more studies to be performed. Conclusions and Roussida discuss the potential applications of these new methods for assessment of back pain. For example, they suggest that using a Roman chair as a training machine might be an effective means of relieving lower back pain without compromising patient comfort."
28155204,"This paper discusses the psychiatry of children with and without bipolar disorder. Although there is some debate as to whether this disease is caused by a childhood ailment or by an adult onset, it is clear that Bipolar disorder is more common in children than in adults."
23677421,"In this study, the effect of a three-week course of physical therapy on patients with knee pain is investigated. The results show that both groups have significant improvements in pain and quality of life after a period of at least three months. Both groups use different types of water to treat their patients. For example, one group uses chlorinated water while the other uses mineral water. This study concludes that there is a significant difference in pain between the two treatment groups. After three months, no significant changes in pain are seen in either group except for an increase in the severity of symptoms."
20451780,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights systematically examines the effects of different bonding methods on tooth strength.

20795921,"A randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of electromechanical walking training and physiotherapy for improving gait speed in patients with mild to severe strokes. The results suggest that this form of therapy is more effective than other forms of treatment, especially when it is combined with physical exercise."
25000940,"The aim of this paper is to describe the effect of a combination of short-term exercise, patient education, and spa therapy on patients who have a painful form of feverish mammotria. It is concluded that these treatments can temporarily improve quality of life for patients suffering from a chronic disease. Aiming to reduce the cost of such treatment, however, we conclude that it is not possible to bias a study cohort by using only one arm in order to determine whether or not there is a significant difference in the outcome between the two groups. However, the results of this trial show that a six-week self-management based program of swimming exercises and education could improve the health of patients with fistmasculosis. Although no differences are found between groups, Aichi significantly improved fms symptoms and sleep quality; while stretching only improved subject's psychological well being. Conclusions That adding an aquatic exercise program into the usual care regimen for firmyalgya in females is cost effective both in terms of health care costs as well as society costs."
27730178,"The results of this study suggest that a combination of exercise training and supplemental oxygen may improve exercise tolerance in patients with mild-to-severe COPD. Both groups show improved quality of life and reduced hospitalization rates. However, both groups do not demonstrate significant improvements in the quality of their lives. They also report that they have no effect on anxiety or depression. Acute ventilation does not improve exercise capacity but improves lung function. Strength training is more effective than endurance training in elderly patients who have moderate to severe disease. Carnitine does not further improve exercise performance in these patients; however, it can be used as an adjunctive treatment for physical rehabilitation."
22211304,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the effects of tooth extraction on the quality of bone after tooth extraction, particularly in relation to the length and height of the socket. It concludes by describing the results of a single-tongue extraction procedure. In this study, convulsions are prevented from further altering the alveol bone ridge; however, it is observed that there is a significant reduction in the size of the extracted socket. The effect of this technique on the healing of the surrounding bone is also described."
28246695,"Back school is a good treatment modality for relieving low back pain. It also improves the biomechanics and trunk flexion, which are important in determining how well the program works. The study concludes that back school is more effective than other forms of physical therapy because it uses limited resources to help patients with their pain. In addition, there is no difference in days of sickness allowance after five years compared to one year in the control group."
30657077,"The results of this study suggest that a person-centered, progressive resistance exercise program can be used to improve physical health and function in women with fibmyalgy. Although there are no significant changes in pain, sleep, fatigue, or tender point count after the intervention, strength training seems to be more effective than other forms of exercise for improving these symptoms."
31140441,"This paper describes a novel approach to identifying and preventing drug-resistance in older adults. It uses a patient-centered, evidence-based approach to track changes in medication adherence over the first month after hospital discharge. The results of this study will aid in the development of new approaches to improving care for older patients with multiple chronic disease."
25149678,"The results of this study suggest that a combination of exercise and physical therapy can be effective in treating knee ostearthritis. A home-based program of exercise is more effective than a conventional exercise regimen for improving pain, muscle strength, and function in patients with the disease. Both groups improve by 1 month, but subjects in the treatment group achieve twice as much improvements in Womac Scores than subjects who perform similar unsupervised activities at home. Conclusions That both exercises are effective in relieving pain and improving physical function, quality of life among people with knee Ostearthrits. In addition, they provide older women with a safe method of practicing ""whole body vibration training"" to reduce their risk of falls."
23122432,This paper focuses on the use of resistance training to improve physical function in older women with chronic heart disease. It uses a fast walk test as an outcome measure and compares it to the 6 minute walk test in patients with congestive chest disease. The results suggest that resistance training can be used as a stand-alone test for improving functional capacity in older adults with heart disease.
23993035,"A prospective, randomized, and open-label study of patients with low back pain shows significant improvement after two years of follow-up in both pain and physical function. In addition, the Prodisc -L system is superior to autografting in terms of patient satisfaction and improved neurologic outcomes. The results suggest that prodisc replacement can be used as an alternative to lumbbar interbody or cervical fusion for patients with discoidity."
15977980,This paper focuses on the evidence for the efficacy of moderate intensity exercise for patients with early-stage breastcancer. It uses a case-control study to examine the effect of seated exercise on fatigue and quality of life in patients with advanced disease. The results suggest that this form of exercise may be an important part of support for patients who have received adjuvant treatment.
30135903,"This paper focuses on the evidence base for the use of patellar tapping to reduce pain in people with paternal foot pain. Although there is strong evidence for this treatment, it is not yet clear whether it will work. For example, patients with knee pain that lasts more than two months seem to have an unfavorable recovery after 12 months of follow-up. A number of studies suggest that exercise should be used to improve function in these patients."
24065550,"In this paper, the authors present a three-compartment outcome system for treating patients with breastcancer: 1) A separate quality of life pathway; 2) A community-based, pragmatic and definitive RCT; and 3) A physical activity intervention. They conclude that exercise is an important treatment for men with early-stage or late-stage breastcancers because it reduces side effects such as pain and fatigue while improving physical function. These results suggest that self-directed exercise may be more successful in relieving these side effects than usual care. Women who are not receiving chemotherapy can benefit from supervised exercise to improve their health. Self-directing exercise also has some positive effects on weight loss but does not lead to any significant changes in body mass. This study furthermore suggests that home-based exercises may be useful for women with mildly advanced breastcarrying disease."
18682540,"The results of this study suggest that pharmacists may be effective in reducing the risk of heart disease for patients with high-risk factors. In addition, pharmacists can improve the efficacy of lipid management by improving patient satisfaction and knowledge of their drug use. This paper also discusses the role of pharmacists in improving blood lipid levels."
23327448,"Conclusions A moderate tidbit of exercise for frail older patients can have favorable effects on defined medical and psychological indices. This intervention also reduces the risk of falls in frail elderly people. Conscious that resistance training is not as effective as other forms of exercise, it is recommended that older adults attend a group exercise program called the LiFE program. Although there is no difference in fall rates between the two groups, strength and balance improvements are similar over time. In contrast, home-based exercise regimens do not improve physical function or pre-clinical disability in older persons. However, these findings suggest that group exercise may be an effective means of preventing falls and maintaining physical function in older people."
25345440,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effects of different dairy fats on cardiovascular risk factors in healthy volunteers. They conclude that consumption of low-fat dairy products can lead to lower levels of total and LDLcholesterol, although it does not seem to be an effective strategy for reducing these risk factors. The results suggest that ""low-fat"" dairy products have no significant effect on blood pressure or heart disease."
28493887,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to weight loss and risk reduction in patients with Type 2 diabetes. They describe a community-based lifestyle intervention that is highly effective at reducing body weight and improving blood pressure among Latinos who are at high risk for Type 2 disease. The results of this study will strengthen the evidence base ""for lifestyle change"" in patients at greater risk of chronic diseases including obesity-related cancers."
22411372,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of a high-fat, carbohydrate restriction diet on subjects with Type 2 diabetes. He concludes that these subjects lose more weight after six months than they would gain from a caloric or fat-restrained diet. This suggests that future studies will need to be performed to evaluate long-term heart health outcomes. The results of this study suggest that ""dietarymodification"" is an effective strategy for reducing blood sugar in type 2 patients."
25472463,"This paper presents the results of a prospective, cross-sectional study of physicians who completed an on-line version of the Self-Report Analysis Questionnaire. The results suggest that the instrument can be used for both psychological and social assessment. Although there are differences in the response rates between the two methods, it is concluded that the survey does not result in a significant increase in response rates."
30712741,"The results of this study suggest that daily consumption of a high-dose of vitamin D fortified yogurt improves glycamic status in Type 2D patients. In addition, it has been found that the use of combined training and/or supplementation with vitamin D can reduce the symptoms of Sensory-Moterial Neuropathy. This paper concludes that there is no significant effect of either type of treatment on serum HbL concentrations; however, it does suggest that takingpart in combined training or supplementation may be able to improve these symptoms."
32220527,"The results of a nine-year follow-up trial of the Sidus stemless shoulder prosthesis demonstrate that it is possible to achieve similar results for both types of prostheses. Conclusions, however, suggest that central sensitizing may be necessary in order to restore function after this type of treatment."
27459705,"This paper presents the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study of overweight Latinos in New York City. The results suggest that weight loss is an effective intervention for preventing Type 2 and other blood-threatening diseases. In addition, this paper suggests that community-based approaches to lifestyle change may be more cost effective than traditional approaches."
30232622,"In this paper, the authors present results of a two-year observational study on dentinal caries in six-to eight-year old children. They conclude that a single-time use of 38 p.m. sealants is not effective for preventing lesions from developing in permanent teeth. The survival rates of both types of restorations are higher than those of conventional approaches. Both groups have similar survival rates after 12 months; however, they do not show any differences in reasons for repair failures between amalgam and art/hvgi cements. A modified retention assessmentcriterion is used to predict future sealant recalls. All three methods had similar success rates during their follow-up period. However, it was found that the bilayer method did not increase the successful rate of class I restoratives. After 12 months, there were no significant differences between the performance of either technique. Two-year survival rates were moderately successful: one year's survival rate was 96.1 percent; the other 96.2 percent was high enough to recommended wide use of art in Tanzania."
25289064,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of our previous studies on psoratic arthritis and describe how efficacy was observed in patients with moderate to advanced disease. We conclude that ETT is a good treatment for patients with mild to moderately severe assensiasis. The main symptoms are pain and inflammation; however, there are marked differences in severity according to spinal mobility and lung function. Furthermore, it has been reported that eTanercept can be used as a new anti-tumor necrosis agent. Conclusions This paper shows that an extended course of etapnercept does not induce relapses in patients who have received other treatments such as steroid or NSAID."
29181296,This paper focuses on the use of physical activity as an intervention in the treatment of patients with Type I and Type II Type I acute pain. It uses a mixed-effects meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of this intervention in terms of improving health outcomes for both men and women.

These include: 1) screening, diagnosis, evaluation, selecting of therapy, treatment goals, and individualize of care; 2) self-effacing by patients in order to improve their quality of life; and 3) appropriate use of exercise and a high-quality diet to manage their condition."
27198046,"In this study, we examine the effects of a daily zinc-supplementation regimen on skinfold thicknesses and growth in infants with low social status. We find that preprimertal children who have poor nutrition can benefit from zinc to improve their weight gain. However, we do not find any significant changes in body composition or length gains after three months of zinc supplementation."
17054174,"In this paper, Lithium is shown to be more effective than imipramine in treating patients with recurrent depression. The authors conclude that there is no need for further studies on its efficability in the long term. They suggest that it is best to continue treatment for at least six months before relapse occurs."
27913280,"In this paper, we present a detailed description of the mechanism by which methadone induces episodic memory loss in patients with a long history of heroin abuse. We conclude that it is possible to prevent such an episode from occurring by giving them a single dose of drug. This treatment can lead to significant changes in both patient's and laboratory-reader's scores on tests of recollections and decision-making. Furthermore, our results suggest that ""different opiates"" are associated with different kinds of behavioral response to feedback."
26923506,"In this paper, the authors present a pilot study on the effects of a low-caloric diet on body composition and weight loss in overweight women. Their results suggest that a high-carbohydrate diet may be more effective in reducing body weight than a higher-calorie diet. They conclude that ""a greater degree of fat loss"" is associated with an increase in the concentration of 25-hydroxyvincrisy-D in the obese."
17636758,"In this paper, we describe the effect of growth-hormone treatment on height in illiterate children with marked short stature who do not respond well to conventional growth-promoting therapy.

25769521,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study of patients with obsesessive compulsive disease. We conclude that early recognition and treatment are necessary to prevent long-term chronic disease. However, there is no significant difference between group differences in Srt or continued Cbt at posttreatment. Consciousness Augmenting self-regularity with exposure and stress management leads to better outcomes after acute treatment; however, maintenance outcome is primarily influenced by OCD severity during entrance. The most commonly used drug side effects are well tolerated"
30794924,"Probiotics are promising new approaches to treating Type 2 Diabetes. In this paper, we present a meta-analysis of 24 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that relate the efficacy of probiotic consumption to changes in blood glucosal homeostasis and inflammatory markers in type 2 patients."
28284517,"Conclusions In this paper, Horton et al. concludes that the three-day ertapenem regimen is the best treatment for acute appendicetis. Twenty-two patients treated with this regimen have initial resolution of their symptoms, and only one patient has recurred after follow-up; overall, 62 percent of patients have no appendectomy. This suggests that medical treatment may be more cost effective than standard surgical treatment in managing an acute infection."
18851916,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the early post-surgery period after partial knee arthroscectomy and concludes that physical therapy is not beneficial in this patient group. He concludes by concluding that patients who receive a home-based exercise program are more likely to recover than those who receive an outpatient physical treatment regimen. However, Anderson suggests that there may be value in having a structured, well-planned, and well-rehearsed rehabilitation program for patients who have pre-existing knee pain."
22006870,"Conclusions Using consensus-making techniques, we developed preliminary thresholds of inactive disease for use in selected JIA categories. These thresholds are in progress and will be used in future studies. Consistency of the exercise test and functional questionnaires was found to be consistently and reliable in children with Judiopathic Arthra. The Biobehavioural model of Pain showed a negative relationship between health status and experience of pain; however, there was no evidence that pain treatment mediated this relationship. Concluusions A definition of improvement is proposed for Juditia."

27419040,"This paper focuses on the early years of schooling and discusses the relationship between overweight status and adverse school outcomes for girls and boys. It concludes that change in overweight status is associated with increased risk for adverse school outcome among girls but does not relate to boys. In addition, changes in eating habits are associated with poor lifestyles and low social determinants. These findings may lead to future studies about reducing childhood obesity."
19461035,"The results of this study suggest that a structured walking program is highly effective in improving gait function in post-stroke patients. It also concludes that an exercise program assisted by sensory manipulation is more effective than a traditional task-oriented training program. In addition, the walk program has been shown to be more successful in improving balance in people with stroke than in those who do not have a physical limitation. This paper furthermore describes a six-week experiment in which subjects were randomly assigned to different groups of exercises while they were restrained from performing their usual activities during the first eight weeks of the experiment. After four weeks, each group was assigned a new set of exercises and after two weeks, both groups were assigned beachtliche improvements. Finally, it was concluded that ""a task-Oriented exercise program"" was more effective in increasing walking ability in persons living in the community as a preventative measure against future strokes."
25098595,This paper describes a pilot study of an eight-week exercise program for patients with severe mental illness. The results suggest that the program can be used to improve physical health and reduce risk of complications in people with serious mental illnesses.
27804961,"The first year after laparoscopic gastric bypass results in significant weight loss and improvements in the quality of life for patients who have undergone this procedure. Compared with other medical treatments, ryb significantly reduces the risk of complications and improves blood-salvage levels. Both procedures lead to improved health-related qualities of life over two years; however, both are associated with shorter post-surgery time and less complications than conventional methods. In addition, they provide better long-term results in terms of physical and mental health. Although there is some disagreement as to whether these effects are permanent or short-lived, it is clear that such an operation can be highly cost effective."

26377094,"Conclusions In this paper, the authors present a detailed overview of the current treatment of children with acute malaria. They conclude that all conditions associated with ""deep coma"" should be corrected and blood transfuses should be given to patients with severe anaemia. Children living in the coast of Africa are at risk of death from malaria during the first two years of life. The effects of malaria on nutrition seem to be greatest throughout the first half of life; however, there is little evidence for a direct relationship between malnutrition and disease in African children. Acute malaria contributes to suboptimal growth among young children."
26590137,"The results of this study suggest that intravesical gabasolic therapy may be able to increase the capacity of patients with bladder-sympathetic disease. In particular, it appears that in patients with persistent pain and/or overactive bladder, a combination of alkalined lidocain and henparin can provide rapid relief of symptoms. This treatment seems to be more effective than other approaches for treating interstitial Cystitis."
26758593,"In this study, we investigate the effects of a single-eating session on blood pressure, lipids, and antioxidant status in women who are pregnant. We conclude that sesame has anti-hypertensesive effects on humans by reducing briskness and increasing ghrelin levels. This suggests that it may be possible to prevent or delay certain types of heart disease."
26269362,"The aim of this study is to determine whether a paleolithic-based diet can be used as a preventative measure against Type 2D. In this study, we examine the effect of a Mediterranean-style diet on blood lipids and other risk factors in patients with Type 2d. We conclude that an alpha-limenic acid rich Mediterranean diet appears to be more effective than conventional diets in preventing heart attack and death."
21757259,"Conclusions In this report, the results of a five-year follow-up cohort of patients with localized or locally advanced prostatecancer are summarized. Only one patient has experienced a preventable death and two do not receive immediate treatment. A combination of high-dose IMRT and transrectal prostatectomy improves overall survival for men with locally advanced disease but does not increase the risk of complications. The rate of death was very low in the surveillance cohort. After 7 to 10, the rate of dead from prostate cancer were very low; however, there were no significant differences between the two groups. Pelvic nodes did not improve prognosis. Postoperatively undetected PSA significantly reduced the risk that biochemical progression would occur. Prophylaxes could be used as an aid to predict metastases free and overall survival because it is independent of the size of the patient's PSA. Conscious of the potential drawbacks of these new approaches, we conclude that they should be considered when treating patients with ""localized orally advanced disease."""
28007054,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of our previous studies on the efficacy of single-dose regimens for prophylacin therapy in patients with severe urological disease. We conclude that these regimens are more effective than other antimicrobial regimens when it comes to controlling fluoroquilone-residued E. colostrum infection. Furthermore, we find that transrectal blood-guided polypsies are safe and can be used as an early warning system for men at high risk of complications."
24780633,"This paper focuses on the barriers to uptake and use of evidence-based practice in allied health.

25590442,"This paper focuses on the effects of walking training on patients with stroke. It shows that gait speed can be improved in patients with mild to moderate strokes, particularly those who have a high-resemblance to their peers. In addition, it suggests that this type of training may be more effective than other types of training because it involves real-world interaction."
21154393,"Conclusions In patients with mild to moderate depression who do not receive adequate relief from antidepressante treatment, a combination of olanzepine andfluoxetine is effective in improving their symptoms. A study comparing the efficaciousness of two different drugs for treating severe depression in patients with mixed-demonsary status shows that both quetipine and fluoxetine are more effective than either agent alone when used as an add-on to standard antipsychotic therapy."
28502570,"The results of this study do not improve the accuracy of total knee arthroplasty in patients who are treated with patient specific cutting blocks. In contrast, the standard instrumentation fails to improve the quality of the tool and does not reduce the time or blood loss required for the procedure."

28052845,"The results of this large-scale study suggest that lifestyle changes can prevent Type 2 diabetes in adults with idgycs. Although the sample size is small, the results are sufficient to support the evidence that diet and exercise can be effective in preventing Type 2 disease. This paper concludes by concluding that women who have pre-gender-disease tend to lose weight more rapidly than those who do not. In addition, there is potential for improved blood sugar control among women with type 2 diseases. A combination of physical activity and meal replacement has been shown to be effective at reducing body weight in people with Igg. However, it does not lead to significant weight loss or improvement in other risk factors."
32271148,"This paper focuses on the use of cloud-based blood pressure management systems to improve patient adherence to medication. The results suggest that this system may be effective in improving blood pressure control for patients with high risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition, it can help reduce the frequency and severity of visits to the doctor's office by reducing the amount of time patients spend asking questions about their health. Although there is some improvement in blood pressure during the intervention period, both groups show signs of sustained drug adherence. However, they do not demonstrate any significant changes in stroke or heart failure at follow-up."
26315934,"Conclusions In this paper, we present the first evidence that shared genetic influences are associated with language performance in later childhood onset of later ailment. We do not find an increased risk of affective and anxiety disorders in children with or without persistent ADHD. Furthermore, there is no association between childhood mood or anxiety disorder and adult mental health problems."
23076956,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates the efficacy of early-infancy-based escorts for children with an extended severity of autism. After two years of follow-up, the treatment group's scores on intelligence, language, and daily living skills appear to be similar to those of children with no prior learning difficulties. The results suggest that early intervention is highly effective for improving the social and emotional well-being of young children who have an eligible congenital or acquired disorder."
29553824,"In this paper, we describe a novel approach to preventing and reducing atheroscomatose disease through consumption of dark chocolate. It is shown that it can be used as a preventative measure against cardiovascular disease by altering the body's lipid profile and blood pressure. We also show that in addition to improving blood pressure, dark chocolate can also improve insulin sensitivity and fat absorption. Our results suggest that ""flavanol rich chocolate"" may have some beneficial effects on patients with heart disease. However, our study does not support any of the predicted benefits of short-lived dark chocolate or cocoa consumption. Instead, it suggests that they may be effective in relieving symptoms of chronic fatigue. The first randomized trial shows that long-term consumption of coconut flavonols appears to lower blood pressure in healthy subjects. This effect seems to be associated with improvements in other important health-related measures such as body weight and BMI. Further studies are needed to confirm these conclusions."
29453657,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which l-carintine was found to be safe and efficacious in reducing blood triglyceria, insulin resistance, hypoadipogenemia, and body weight in subjects at high risk of heart attack. We conclude that L-carntine may have some anti-obesity effects by reducing the levels of cholestrerol in patients with newly-diagnosed Type 1 DM."
27247216,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to treating pancreatic malignancies. They describe a regimen consisting of linear accelerator-delired SBRT and gemcitabine in combination with an add-on regimen of cynoprolin and capecitebine. These two regimens are more efficacious than standard treatment for patients with locally localized disease. Although they do not improve overall survival or progression free survival, they demonstrate that they can be used as stand-alone therapy. The results of this study suggest that it may be possible to use anti-Egfrinorinb alone as a predictor of patient outcome."
24589525,"The purpose of this paper is to develop a tool for assessing the risk of future disability in older women. It uses an original assessment tool, developed by Conclusions, that captures early symptoms of disability and can be used as an inexpensive measure for determining those older people at higher risk for future mobility limitation; it also reduces the frequency with which older people complain about their tiredness. This study has been published in Australia and Newzeal and Clinical trials register, AnzCTRN126008000507382. Concluusions Age-regular changes in function are complex and lead to much heterogenity. In seeking preventive mobility limitations, vision, reaction time, and lower legumination needs to be targeted in addition to muscles strength and balance"
29059584,"This paper focuses on the effects of iron-supplementation on women's health in pregnancy. It concludes that weekly iron supplementation has a higher level of compliance than daily iron, although side effects may be more significant. In particular, it is concluded that bovine leucoferrin can be used as a first-line treatment for pregnant women with anemia due to reduced levels of circulating IL-6 after two months of use."
28629342,"The MBSR program has significant positive effects on mental distress, self-reported well-being, and mindfulness in female medical students. Hypnosis also seems to have a beneficial effect on the mood of selfhypnosis as well as JoHrei's suggestion that it might be useful for stress reduction. Conclusive evidence suggests that a short, low-cost psychological intervention can improve blood levels of IL-6, which is important for immune function. In this study, hypnotists were shown to reduce both physical and mental symptoms in patients with different psychiatric background. These results suggest that they may be useful in treating herpes infection."
30574441,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on risk factors for spinal sprains and suggests strategies to prevent them. He concludes by describing the importance of preoperative nutrition before spine surgery in order to reduce the rate of post-surgery complications. He then uses a patient-specified risk factor model to predict whether or not patients will develop sprained nerves during spine surgery."
27683062,"In this paper, Conclusions outlines the results of a randomized, double-blind, feigning atrial fibrillation trial. The results suggest that cryoblation is superior to conventional methods for treating patients who have asymptomatic atrial fibrilation because it uses less energy and can be performed in shorter time. This study also suggests that Cryobolon ablation may be more effective in treating patients with persistent atrial fever."
20881326,"Conclusions In this paper, the authors present an overview of the latest developments in the field of caries lesions. They primarily focus on two topics: 1) experimental methods for preventing caries formation; and 2) restorative materials that can be used to prevent caries from occurring. The first is a review of recent scientific evidence on the use of fluoride as a scaffold for caries prevention. Although these studies have not been directly compared to those of other papers, they do demonstrate that fluorde-containing resins are more effective at preventing tooth caries than any other material."
26951286,"In this paper, we examine the conflicting conclusions of three different studies. The first is a meta-analysis and the second a randomized controlled trial. This paper discusses some of the most commonly held beliefs regarding the use of vitamin D in the treatment of falls, fractures, and other acute and chronic diseases. It concludes with a detailed discussion of the evidence for these beliefs."
22895977,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of exercise on upper-limb and neck pain in workers. He concludes by stating that ""a feedback signal"" from a mouse does not increase the prevalence or incidence of upper-arm and neck symptoms but it does reduce disability scores. This study is important for two reasons: first, it provides evidence that a specific workstation postural intervention is unlikely to reduce upper-upper-extremity pain among workers who use wheelchairs; second, it improves worker's performance by reducing fatigue and improving posture. Finally, it suggests that an education program may be more effective than a long-term one-day training session."
23388159,"In this paper, the authors present evidence for the use of iron-fortification in drinking water as an alternative to conventional methods. They conclude that it is possible to fortify household drinking water with iron and other nutrients to reduce the risk of developing anemia in schoolchildren in poorer countries. However, they do not find any significant protective effects on anemia among children who are not deficient in iron. These results suggest that there may be a need for further research into the role of iron in anemia."
30060614,"The results of this study suggest that both swb consumption and asb consumption are associated with increased Type 2D risk. However, we cannot rule out that other factors than asb eating that we didn't control for were responsible for these association with diabetes. Conclusions Both swedged soft drinks and sucrose were associated with elevated T2D risks. We cannonball further evidence that they may be involved in the association with type 2D. In isocalloric periods, overweight men do not develop significant changes in blood lipids or liver enzymes compared to similar amounts of sugar. This suggests an energy-mediated effect rather than ""a specific Macnutrient-Mediated effect."" Consciousness There was no change in fat balance between controlled overfed with fat vs. glucose. A Mediterranean cohort did not show any increase in weight gain among those who had already lost weight. These studies suggest that regular consumption of sugarsweetened soft beverages and fruit drinks has been associated with increases in risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus; however, there has been little attention paid to the effects of fruit drinks on health."
28983663,"This paper focuses on the use of exercise as a treatment for patients with acute spondiness. It uses a mixed-effects model to assess the efficacy and drawbacks of different forms of exercise, including home-based walking, swimming, and gymnastic exercises. In particular, it shows that water-based exercise is more effective in relieving pain and improving quality of life than physical exercise alone. The results suggest that this form of exercise may be useful in treating patients with ""ankylosing,"" or sudden, severe, recurrent, or localized disease."
29954184,"CardioBEAT is a prospective, randomized, open-label study of the efficacy and safety of an advanced alerting system for heart failure patients. Its primary endpoint is reduced time spent by physicians and increases the percentage of change rated as ""most meaningful."" In addition, it provides detailed cost information on the impact of this system on the German health care system."
26091856,"In this paper, Conclusions demonstrates that the use of ""real time contact force guidance"" can lead to significant reductions in the time and cost of ablation for patients with drug resistant af. Conscious of the potential for safety and long-term efficacy of this new technology, Conclisions concludes that it is superior to conventional needle-free fistbang for reducing the risk of heart attack in patients with advanced ailment."
21817143,"The results of this study suggest that telmalan-HCTZ is more effective at lowering blood pressure than vasartan-HTZ at dosages of 80 and 25mg in stage 1 to 2 hypertension. This suggests that combined treatment may be more advantageous than single drug therapy because combined treatments improve caustination and heart response. In contrast, the combination of amlofdipine and abbottinox appears to be most useful for improving BP control when compared with monotherapies alone. These two drugs appear independent of one another; however, they seem to have specific protective effects on arterial stiffness. ARBs are particularly good at reducing a patient's BP as well as their ability to prevent new episodes of acute ailment in patients with persistently high BP. Both angiotensolic blockers and arbustins can reduce circulating levels of VCAM1 in type 2 or diabetic patients who have been treated with these antiarthrotic drugs. Although both regimens are well tolerated, it is necessary to increase the dose of each agent in order to obtain better results."
31182084,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of an ""electrified decision support system"" to improve care for patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Although it has been used in practice for over a decade, there is still little evidence for its efficacy in improving patient outcomes. This paper discusses some of the most promising developments in the field of decision-support systems. For example, physicians are now able to make informed decisions about their patients without having to go directly to the doctor's office. However, these decisions do not lead to improvements in blood pressure or other measures of disease control. Anderson concludes by stating that although many studies have tried to find out how effective decision support systems can be, no one has yet found a strong scientific basis for their use."
22000709,"Conclusions In this study, Wollstonecraft eloquently describes the effect of daily supplementation with 15 ng.d. over 12 months on bone health in young adults living in northern Irel. The results suggest that young adults do not consume adequate daily  diet to maintain their vitamin D levels in the winter time. A daily supply of 15 g.D. significantly increases blood 25hh concentration but does not affect indicesof bone health among the whole group of girls; however, there is an effect on body mass and bone mineral content for a particular genotype. This suggests that young adult women in NorthernIrel should not consume sufficient daily dietary allowance of vitamin D so that they will be able to reach high levels of ""spread vitamin D status"" during the winter. Conscious of the fact that young men are deficient in these essential nutrients, it is necessary to determine the exact amount of required daily nutrient intake needed to meet the desired level of 25Hh. It is important to consider the wide range of available doses ofvitamin D as well as the relative importance of age-related changes in bone function."
22351714,"In this paper, Consoland and his colleagues conclude that there is no significant difference between the fat-to-flora ratio during over-eating with either fat, sugar, or sweetened drinks. Their conclusion is that ""florose seemed to be responsiblefor the impaired Insul binding and Insul sensitivity in men"". They also conclude that higher consumption of sugarsweetened beverages increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by providing excessive amounts of rapidlyabsorbed sugars. Consuming sugar sweetened beverages is also associated with weight gain and increased risk for developing Type 2 disease in women."
29267561,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a large-scale randomized trial on enteral feeding after pancreatic surgery. The safety and efficacy of enteral feeding for patients with severe scarlet throucomes are described. A mixed-effects nesophagomy was found to be more effective than enteral fasting in terms of shortening the postoperative stay and improving wound healing. We conclude that enteral nutrition is safe and can be used as a preventative measure against complications during major surgery."
27467441,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the use of EEG measures to predict efficacy of antiepressant treatment in patients with mild-to-medicated mental disease. Although there is no direct relationship between EEG and behavior, we do find that Mph does not prevent learning the hand-eye-hand combat task in healthy volunteers. However, during practice blocks, it does not favor performance in the control group. Furthermore, this study suggests that AEDs may have different effects on the brain than they do on their nervous system."
25359643,"Conclusions This chapter discusses the effects of retraction on gingival bleeding and concludes that epinephrine cords can safely be used in patients with healthy gums. Although blood contamination before bonding increases the risk of leakage, it does not affect the strength of the bond between cement and dentin as it is dependent on the type of adhesive used. Confused specimens contaminated by blood show a significant reduction in shear strength when compared to those contaminated without blood. These results suggest that blood contamination reduces bond strength of ""total- and selfetching Adhesive"" and ""self-etching resin cement""."
11555536,"In this paper, Wutherings demonstrates the efficacy of inspiratory breath exercises in preventing thrombosis after both laparoscopic and post-thoracomycy surgery. He concludes that incentive breathing exercises are as effective as physical therapy for reducing adolescent lung volume after these procedures. However, his study does not show any significant improvement in patients with a low risk of pulmonary complications after either procedure."
25105982,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the cost-effectiveness of surgical therapy for patients with Type 2 diabetes. He compares the safety and efficacy of two different types of weight loss procedures: Lrygb and Rouxen-Y Gastric bypass. While both procedures result in significant weight loss, they are associated with longer reoperation times and more serious complications than either procedure. Both procedures improve quality of life after six and 12 months; however, there is still a need for further studies to confirm these results."
28829161,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to reducing the risk of necrotizing Enterocolitis in premature infants by feeding exclusive human milk during the first fourteen days of life. They conclude that this will save money on maternal care and reduce the need for expensive donor milk."
29523009,"In this paper, we present a meta-analysis of the available evidence on the efficacy of vitamin K in preventing or reducing the risk of Type 2 diabetes. We conclude that there is little evidence for a positive effect of either type K or other antidiabenic ingredients on blood glucose concentrations in rats with Type 1 disease."
22439920,"Conclusions A combination of nurse-centered care management and telemedicine can improve the control of patients with Type 2 diabetes in urban American populations. Although results are clinically important, they do not reach significant significance. In this study, conciliatory approaches were used to improve patient health but did not achieve significant improvements in quality of care or intermediate outcomes. The ADAP program was well received and improved short term metabolic control. However, it did not improve intermediate outcomes; further studies need to be performed. Conscious of the limitations of these approaches, additional measures must be taken to reduce excess risk of complications among African Americans who have poor control of their disease. This approach should be further considered as part of an integrated chronic disease management strategy."
17329131,"A supervised walking program is superior to an unsupervised home-based exercise program in improving symptoms and quality of life after six months of exercise training. In addition, the results of a structured exercise program are comparable to those of supervised exercises. The only significant difference in performance between the two groups is that the ability to walk has been improved over a 24-week period. Furthermore, there is no increase in leukocyte counts or neutrophil count after 12 weeks of treadmill exercise. This suggests that a pain-free regimen can be used as a preventative measure against ischemia-reperfusion injury."
28135725,"The results of the Syst Eur trial suggest that blood pressure lowering therapy reduces major cardiovascular events by decreasing levels but not variability in blood pressure. This is important because it suggests that higher blood pressure levels may lead to greater risk of stroke, heart attack, and other serious events. Although more intense treatment is still associated with improvement in patient well-being, there are some small adverse consequences for quality of life among elderly patients treated with this type of hypertension. Indapamivir reduced the frequency of severe clinical outcome in elderly patients who were older than 70 years of age. Conclusions That active treatment in such a study was associated with slight adverse effects on quality oflife. Consciousness The results provided provide evidence that Antihypertensesive treatment with or without Perindopriil in persons 80 Years of age or Old is beneficial."
28107576,"In this paper, the authors present a systematic review of the most commonly used pain-relief treatments for skin wounds. They conclude that topical creams are more effective than topical drops in relieving pain and that cold air cooling is sufficient to reduce side effects. The authors also discuss the use of a new topical peel for treating leg veins as well as an electrode for local anesthesia."
22786504,"In this paper, we present the results of a feighner-response study in which patients received either analprazolam or imipramine for six weeks. Alprasolam was more efficacious as an antidopamine than amipromine; however, side effects were less frequent in both groups. Both drugs improved on the Hamilton psychiatric rating scale for depression but did not show any significant differences in response between treatment and placebo. The relative efficacy of the two drug groups was intermediate to that of the other two."
27580753,"This paper discusses the use of colored lenses to improve reading performance in children with a variety of learning difficulties. Although there is some evidence that these effects are motivated by attributional motives, it is clear that they are not."

31619239,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft uses a novel risk-regression approach to predict the future of dairy cows in an effort to reduce the frequency and severity of their lameness. The results suggest that there is a high level of risk for cattle with severe lesions at spring trims, but no evidence suggests that these conditions are associated with increased risk of injury. We develop a new risk-of-bias tool, called Robins-I, to assess the relative efficacy of different treatment regimens from studies that do not use randomization to assign subjects to compare groups. This new tool will aid those undertaking systematic reviews who include non-random or omized studies."
23359235,"Ranitidine is associated with increased risk of infection, necrotizing lesions, and death in vLBW children. Conclusions: Ugib in the newborn baby is frequently associated with clinically relevant mucousal lessions of the upper gastric tract. After treatment with anti secretory drugs, is generally quick and favorable, with recovery usually within 24 to 48 h. Consumption of pantorazole or vitamin E reduces the risks of Enterocolitis by reducing the amount of acidic feeds that are given to premature infants. In addition, patients who receive proton pump-inhibitors have more acid suppressant activity than those who do not. The rate of isolated pathogens was higher at nine of 59; 15 %; and within 48 hour of a measured serum interleuin 6, concentration than aninterleukin six level of 0% pgm/ml. These results suggest that pH may play a role in the development of Necrotic Entero Colitis."
23832963,"This paper focuses on the efficacy of climpramine in treating patients with Major Depressive disorder. It is shown that a single-agent regimen of solitary dostoevskyian morphine does not lead to significant changes in remission or worsening of symptoms after eight weeks of treatment. In addition, it shows that venlfaxine has a superior safety profile when used as an extended-release form of treatment for patients with severe depression."
21143921,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to balance training that uses visual feedback to improve balance function in older women. They conclude that balance training can be used as a preventative measure against falls and that it can be extended over a six-month period. The results are quite different from those obtained with other forms of balance training, such as hand-to-hand exercises. For example, patients who receive weight-shifting instructions during balance training have improved their balance for at least six months. However, there is no significant difference in the frequency of falls between the two treatment groups. ABF improves stance stability in stroke patients by increasing amount of posturation corrections. Conclusions and Discussion Although balance training does not improve postural control after stroke, it does improve gait improvement. It is important to note that age-related changes do not necessarily translate into changes in functional performance."
22023891,"In this paper, Anderson systematically analyzes the literature on upper-limb recovery after stroke to identify which predictors are most important in predicting outcome."
29793007,"In this paper, Dr. Barlow focuses on the effect of neuromuscular tapping on patients with shoulder pain who have had a stroke and demonstrate that it can reduce pain and improve range of motion in subjects with arm or neck painfulness. This paper also discusses the use of ""minimal detectable change"" as an outcome measure for chronic pain. Although there is no significant difference between the severity of pain measured by the Pain Questionnaire and the Short Pain Inventory, these results suggest that they may be useful as predictors of improvement in future studies."
20662327,"Children with pressor-willi syndrome show significant improvement in body composition after a six-month gh treatment. The effect of this treatment on height is dose dependent, but it does lead to improvements in motor development and body composition for children with PWs. In addition, the results suggest that early treatment may be more promising than later treatment. All children remain prepubertal throughout the study period; however, fasting serum Insulin concentrations are measured after twelve months and are found twice as high among those treated with rebhGH. Short-term growth rate and response to 66mg/d GH treatment were similar for all genotypes carried. Both spontaneous growth rates andresponsiveness to 96mu/l GH therapy was similar for each type of genotype carrying. A specific Age-Dependent Pattern of Physical Growth was identified in patients with Urtus predisposes them to autoantibody disease and thus interferes with GH treatments. In conclusion, early'discontinuous' Gh treatment seems to be safe and efficient options to normalize preparationubertal height or weight in the most common short-stagnated children. Although long-term follow-up studies are needed before"
30723698,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effect of physical activity on survival in breastcancer patients. He concludes that exercise is safe and can be used as a preventative measure for early-stage disease. However, it does not seem to have any significant effect on post-treatment weight loss. Furthermore, spirituality counseling has been shown to improve quality of life among African American breastcane survivors. Finally, Anderson discusses the potential of wearable devices to aid in weight loss by predicting changes in health status after treatment."
29279934,"The results of this study suggest that a daily dose of four000 IU of vitamin D may be sufficient to prevent bone loss in elderly people who are deficient in the anti-osteoporotic mineral content. In addition, it suggests that exercise is safe and effective for improving symptoms in older women. A significant increase in risk of coronary death was seen among those receiving all three active substances. When both the groups taking any two of these treatments were combined with either one or none of these two treatment, an increase in Coronary deaths was seen, most significant in those receiving only one or not of thesetwo treatments. This paper concludes that annual oral dosage of high-dosing chole calculiferol increases the risk of fractures among older community dwelling women. However, there is no evidence that such a regimen will prevent fractures in patients with at least one risk factor."
27097638,"Telemonitoring is not an effective intervention for postponing or improving quality of life for patients with a past history of asthma. The use of the weekly ccq assessment as a preventive measure of severity of disease does not improve outcome in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. A second generation of telephonoring has been trialed and results suggest that it may be more cost effective than conventional care. Home telemonitory services do not improve patient health or psychological outcomes, but there are still concerns about the deleterious effects of this form of technology. In particular, frail older adults perceive that home treatment is useful and can be used to treat their condition. This study furthermore confirms previous findings regarding the efficacy of remote chest tidbits in predicting exacerbebations among patients with severe asthma. Further studies need to be performed on these patients before they will be applied to general population."
21421652,"The trough and peak blood pressure changes predict the severity of the disease in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. In this study, lossartan is more efficacious than candetil at once-daily doses for reducing blood pressure. It also has a good tolerability when used as an angiotensol blocker."
24385448,"In this chapter, the authors summarize the results of their studies on atrial ablation. They conclude that it is safe and efficacious to use circumferential or segmental pulmary vein isolation for patients with persistent atrial fist-throbbing. They also discuss the advantages and drawbacks of different approaches for treating these patients."
31722891,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a pilot study in which we found no significant improvement in physical activity for patients with chronic obstructive urgatory after an outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program. We conclude that ""telescoaching"" with step count targets does not improve moderate-intension physical activity levels among people with plebeiac disease. This is due to the difficulty of recruitment and negative intermediate analysis. A further study was needed to determine whether telephone-based physical activity coaching could be used as a stand-alone intervention or whether it would be better to use a combination of remote and in-person exercise counseling."
28057651,"This paper presents the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study on stroke patients' physical activity. The authors conclude that strength training is superior to other forms of exercise in improving leg strength and timed-up and improving quality of life among stroke survivors."
21534681,"Conclusions In this study, we report that exercise training is associated with modest reductions in primary end point or hospitalization for all causes of death and in other key end points. This can be used as a basis for further intervention in patients with heart failure."
30012042,"Conclusions Telemonitoring improves blood glucose control in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Using voice-inception, physicians can send real-time blood glucose readings to the patient and track changes over time. The results suggest that telemedicine case management may be an effective treatment for type 2 patients without increasing their risk of complications. Confused by the small size of the study, this paper concludes that it is possible to use telehealth as a preventative measure against serious disease."
31922465,"In this paper, Wulliver focuses on the effects of linine on blood pressure, anthropometrics, and other blood biochemistry. He concludes that l-arinine appears to have some health benefits in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. Although it does not seem to have any direct effect on lipids or on lipoproteins, its ability to increase blood flow seems to be an important risk factor for heart disease."
32194215,"This study demonstrates that probiotics can be used to improve blood glucose control in pregnant women with glycemia. In addition, it is concluded that this regimen may reduce the risk of premature birth and subsequent weight gain. Furthermore, it has been found that maternal adherence to a low-carb diet was associated with reduced risk of developing gestational type 2 disease."
30866488,"In this paper, we describe the use of an extra-hyphobic, amorphous, self-adhesive layer over two-step Osse-Dentin bonding systems to improve the long-term performance of these materials."
25270082,"In this paper, the Working Group discusses the results of their work on inguinal shenia and concludes that there is a higher rate of reoccurrence after laparoscopic surgery compared to sutured repairs. They also suggest that patients should stop smoking before having an operation because mature collagen is essential for wound healing. A comparison of two different surgical techniques is made: open-laparoscopie repair and transperitotal herniation. The results indicate that both methods are safe and can be performed safely without increased risk of complications."
21930855,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the association between changes in the ECG-valve-hist score and future risk of heart disease and stroke. They conclude that change in the scores is stronger than use of ""ditotomous"" categorical risk factors such as age, smoking, blood pressure, and the presence of certain risk factors. Their results suggest that patients with high risk for coronary disease may benefit from exercise stress testing. This study also provides evidence that exercise-induced silent Myocardial Iscemia is associated with an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease."
23053553,"The results of this study suggest that a low-sugar diet may be advantageous for patients with Type 2 who are at risk of developing Type 2 because it reduces their consumption of transfatty acids. In addition, the presence of elevated glycemic levels leads to an increase in both small and dense LDL, which further supports the importance of eating low in trans fats to counteract these changes. This paper concludes by concluding that ""consequential"" studies have suggested that transfasic acid is associated with increased postpr or ial Insulemia in overweight patients with non-distance melancholy. Conclusions These conclusions confirm previous evidence that transfats can alter lipoprotein profiles; however, they do not lead to significant changes in glucose and blood pressure."
23764669,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a large-scale, randomized, controlled trial on the efficacy and safety of zinc in treating acute diarrhea. Although there is some evidence that zinc can be used as an adjuvant to ORS in children with acute or chronic cholera, it is not shown to have any significant effect on the duration or severity of the disease."
12096150,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, observational study of patients with severe heart failure who received warfarin for five years. We find that these patients had a lower risk of stroke than other patients and that anticoagulant therapy was effective in reducing these risks. However, we conclude that there is a need for further evidence of the efficacy of long-term use of antithrobolic agents in patients with moderate to severe heart failing."
31943828,"In this paper, we describe the results of a randomized, controlled trial of early-child intervention for autistic children. The results suggest that early-care intervention can have significant effects on core impasses in young children with mild to moderately severe ASD. Parents are less likely to be stressed and more likely to engage their children in meaningful play. This suggests that early childhood intervention is an effective treatment for some forms of autism, but it must be based on evidence from other sources."
25914903,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective observational study on the efficacy and safety of abdominal drainage for patients with acute or complicated appendicetis. We conclude that abdominal drains are superior to open lavages in preventing postoperative complications from acute or sub-infection. Furthermore, our study suggests that delayed primary closure may be more effective in reducing the risk of infection than punctured drains."
29302846,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to weight loss in patients with Type 2 Diabetes. They use a combination of physical and dietary changes to improve their patients' risk of developing Type 2 disease. Both diets result in significant weight loss and improvement in blood glucose levels as well as improvements in other risk factors. Although both diets lead to greater weight loss than conventional diets, they do not show any beneficial effects on long-term health."
27545902,"This paper describes a long-term, i.e., a randomized trial of a combination of physical and psychological intervention for childhood cancer patients. Although the treatment did not induce changes in health knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors among these patients, gender differences, and specific health goals were found. The results suggest that future treatments should be tailored to reflect women's individual differences in their health goals."
25122666,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the association between leg strength and mortality in patients with patello-adiac disease, also known as primary adolescent thrombosis. It uses a combination of patient-reported blood pressure and body weight measurements to predict whether or not an intervention will improve survival for people with pad."
25957185,"Conclusions The results of this randomized trial suggest that adjuvant therapy may be more effective than standard treatment in patients with newly resected, unresectable, or metastatic lung disease. In particular, the addition of high-dose chemoradation to the regimen improves overall survival for patients with entirely resectioned, non-smal cell lung cancer."
30244208,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft demonstrates that the use of short and curved stems can prevent substantial loss of bone mass in the long term. However, these stems are not as strong as conventional prostheses because they have a tendency to distally transfer forces. Short stems do not lead to significant bone remodeling; however, they do lead to an improvement in functional scores after two years. Both stems achieve superior fixation and result in similar bone remodeling over the next five years. The only difference is in the length of the liner between the two groups. A follow-up study will be conducted to verify stability and to further investigate the efficacy of different types of stems for hip replacement."
20467515,"In this paper, Conclusions demonstrates that the six-min walk test is highly accurate and reliable in predicting heart failure in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. The results suggest that a standardized walking test may be an effective first-line assessment for these patients."
18254008,"In this paper, the authors present an evidence-based physiotherapy regimen for patients suffering from acute myosis. They conclude that exercise therapy can be used to improve pain and function by reducing the severity of the disease in patients with assas. A three-week program of combined physical and drug treatment is shown to be highly effective in relieving pain and improving functional capacity in patients who have assassinated their condition."
19688227,"Conclusions In this paper, the authors present a summary of their results in a single-patient study. They conclude that the new glass-Ionomer restorative technique has shown good results in terms of patient survival, marginal failure, and fractures for Class I and Class II cavities. Both approaches are suitable for patients with high-class or low-class caries who do not have access to other treatment methods. However, there is still a need for more evidence on the efficacy of these two approaches in treating children."
22943325,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a series of randomized controlled trials using routine intra-operative colangiography. The results suggest that routine surgery is safe and effective for patients with mild to moderate choleclasis. However, there are still some drawbacks as to whether or not it is necessary to perform conventional cholangography in these patients."
30180088,"In this paper, we present the results of a two-year observational study on children's pain scores. We conclude that both the Children's Pain Score and the Freudian Posterio-Scantle scale are valid and reliable for measuring pain in children under the age of 5 and 12 years. Conclusions: These studies provide important information regarding how acute pain responds to intervention in the ed; furthermore, the VAS has an excellent relationship with the Wbs, suggesting that it may be useful as an assessment instrument for young children. Discussion: This study does not improve the accuracy of the F PS-R or the Faustle because it is difficult to distinguish between different articles. However, there are some differences in the severity of pain measured by these measures. For example, patients who report severe pain seem few of the behavior indicators of distressused in the Cheops. There were fair to moderate negative Correlations of pain perception among parents and healthcare professionals. Conclusions: The faces pain scale and color analog scale do influence children ""s and parents'rated pain intensity in clinical setting."""
20386243,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to improving heart failure care: ""specially trained nurses"" can reduce readmissions in patients with chronic heart failure. They conclude that home-based intervention by nurses improves patient outcomes and health-related qualities of life during the first three months after admission. The results suggest that nurse-led case management is more cost effective than usual care for patients with severe heart failure; however, they do not show any significant effect on mortality or event free survival. Nurse-led treatment does not result in an improvement in self-reporting disease-specific measures of health related quality of life at one year's follow up. However, it does lead to reductions in outpatient visits and hospitalizations as well as improvements in physical and mental health status. These results are important because women at risk for Poor Outcome Following Hospitalization for Acute Myocardial Infatriation can be identified, ie unemployed or retired, poorly adjusted To their Heart Failure illness, or readmitted to hospital within twelve weeks of previous cardiac admission. Angina Plan seems to improve psychological, symptomatical, and functional state of patients newly suspected of angina. Conclusions This study"
31679041,"In this present study, the authors conclude that there are no significant differences between the two groups in terms of the morphological and chemical characteristics of the patients treated with either treatment. However, further studies must be performed to confirm these conclusions. Melatonmin is shown to have anti-inflammatory and chemoprotective effects on a number of different inflammatory markers."
32127750,"Conclusions The Cupid trial did not demonstrate any significant treatment effect on primary or secondary outcome. Although there were no safety concerns, side effects seemed affect compliance. Furthermore, the intervention had significant extra costs with no improved health outcomes; therefore, it was domineeringly cost effective. future work should focus more on determinism and further studies of cannanobinol's potential as a neuroprotective agent in multiple sclerotic patients. In this paper, we describe the results of a single-blind, escort study that compared morphine to placebo for pain relief in patients with Multiple Sclerosis. We conclude that opium has modest but ""clinically relevant"" effects on central pain when compared to placebo. There are no significant adverse events, however, and only mild intoxication. A long-term placebo-controlled study is needed to confirm these conclusions. Further studies need to be performed to determine whether canninol may have an extended efficacy beyond symptom alleviation in MS."
24045741,"The purpose of this paper is to develop a tool for predicting the risk of future disability in older women. It uses an original assessment tool, the Self-Report Assessment, as a basis for determining which women should be targeted for preventive intervention. Older women who have low physical function show little improvement in their scores after the exercise program; however, they may benefit from tailoring exercises based on their ability to move. In addition, balance training improves health and well-being but needs more investigation. Conclusions A structured pa intervention improved the SppB score and other measure of physical performance while improving gait stability. Discussion And Conscusion The Life-Space Score can be used by physicians to document patients'mobility within their community and home. This score can be combined with other measures and tools to generate hypotheses that explain mobility limitations and to plan appropriately intervention to address these deficions."
24139781,"This paper discusses the use of weekly monetary incentives to motivate college students to meet their fitness center goals and to lose body fat. Although the incentive does not lead to improved exercise adherence, it does lead to higher energy expenditure and weight loss. Post-hoc analysis suggests that the amount of exercise required for successful long term weight loss is quite high than that recommended in behavior treatment programs."
26608309,"The safety and efficacy of methylphini date in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypochondriac patients with relapsing bipolar disorder are reported. A mixed-effects model is used to predict the effects of different doses of MPH on social function. Methlypheni date has a stronger effect on symptoms than morphine, but side effects are similar to those typically seen in other populations."
18603458,"This paper discusses the use of an e-patient diary to track pain changes over time and to predict changes in response to treatment. It also discusses some of the drawbacks of using paper or pencil methods for patient tracking. For example, it is not possible to accurately predict pain intensity without changing the patient's habits. Furthermore, there is little evidence that patients with chronic pain respond to medication directly."
16508562,"A randomized, double-blind study comparing the effects of weight reduction and physical exercise on blood pressure is presented. Although there are no significant changes in blood pressure between the two groups, it is suggested that this treatment may be more effective than other methods. The authors conclude that ""long-term physical exercises improve endothelaxation"" by increasing the release of Nitric oxide in hypertension patients. They conclude that long- term physical exercise reduces blood pressure but does not affect plasma lipid levels. In general, these results suggest that short-lived physical exercise may be an effective treatment for mildly hypertension."
26457234,"In this paper, we describe the effect of a combination of physical and dietary training on obesity in Latina children. The results suggest that exercise training can be used as a preventative measure against excessive weight gain. We conclude that this is a good strategy for treating overweight children because it reduces both body weight and blood triglycerides. This study also supports the use of an exercise-training program to treat childhood obesity."
32219688,"In this paper, Holmwood focuses on the effectiveness of workplace physical exercise in relieving back pain and improving muscle strength. He concludes that it is not necessary to use improved aerobic capacity as a preventive measure for back pain; rather, it should be used as an alternative strategy. The Spine care for Nurses program reduces chronic low back pain but does not lead to improvements in general fatigue or injury. A light exercise program was not effective at reducing neck-shoulders pain among female hospital workers. However, it did improve muscle endurance and reduce fear avoidance beliefs and health utilization. This suggests that future studies need to focus more on the implementation aspect of the intervention to maximise results more distal than the intervention itself."
22204444,"This paper focuses on the efficacy of a ""behaviorally-based lifestyle"" intervention to improve physical activity among older adults. It uses accelerometers as an instrument to track changes in body mass, energy expenditure, and exercise adherence over time. The main outcome predictors are short-term lapses, lack of lapsed, low intention at baseline, high perceivedquality of the program, positive attitude toward exercise participation, and few risk factors for underadherence. In addition, it is recommended that patients be taught how to cope with these risk factors so that they do not fall prey to temptation."
20439575,"In this paper, the effects of growth-hormone treatment on aprader-labhart-willi syndrome are described. The initial changes in height, weight, and muscle mass were noted; however, these changes did not lead to an improvement in body composition or performance. Both growth-and testosterone-induced changes in ECW were independent and additive. However, there was a significant increase in both lean tissue and muscle strength with GH treatments. These results suggest that GH may be useful for treating patients with ""muscle-wasting"" conditions."
27724985,"In this study, the effects of a diet low in oat content on both total and low density cholesterol are investigated. The results suggest that consumption of high-fibrilty bread may be an effective strategy for reducing bloodcholesterol while maintaining a healthy lipid profile. This paper concludes by describing the effect of two different types of food on lipid levels: 1) whole grain bread; and 2) ""hypocaloric"" diets. Both groups showed significant reductions in their respective lipid concentrations as a result of either change in body weight or other changes in physical activity. These changes were not associated with changes in serum lipid values. However, they did appear to contribute to improved lipid profiles in patients with Type 2 disease. All three groups reduced their meals from marginal levels during the first six weeks of the trial. They also reduced their daily allowance of Calcium, Copper, Flute, and Potentiate from these marginal levels. Although no significant differences were observed between the group for all outcome value except Phoebe's levels, there was wide variations in observation results suggesting that individualresponsiveness may have been an issue."
32140831,"This paper presents the results of a large-scale, long-term prospective observational study on shoulder arthrosis. The authors conclude that total shoulder resection is superior to hemiartroplasty in terms of pain and function, but it is associated with an increase in the cost of the procedure."
31965537,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights et al concludes that percutaneous needle-aspiration is an effective and safe approach to treating large amobic liver lesions. He concludes by stating that it hastens the patient's recovery in patients with larger than 6cm wide abcesses. The authors conclude that ""percutaneous needle aspidation is safe"" and that there is a faster response in those with greater than 6 cm wide abchesces. They conclude that metirondazole should be used instead of conventional drug therapy because it has longer lasting effects."
14763717,Conclusions This paper concludes that strength training can be used to improve physical function in stroke survivors. Post-stroke patients show significant improvement in their functional status after a six-week program of strength training.
27941660,"In this paper, Conclusions discuss the potential for reducing the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by using metformin alone or in combination with other anti-diabetic and riferolic drugs. These studies suggest that long-term treatment with metformedin may lead to elevated levels of ""hocysteine,"" which is a measure of blood triglycemicity. This study also discusses the possible side-effects of different forms of drug therapy on patients with Type 2, particularly women with Polycystric Ovarian Syndrome."
29146638,"The results of this large-scale, cross-sectional study suggest that lifestyle changes can prevent Type 2 diabetes in adults with a high risk of developing the disease. In particular, lifestyle changes are associated with reductions in body weight, physical activity, and blood sugar levels. This suggests that lifestyle change may be an effective strategy for preventing Type 2 disease in low-resource countries such as India."
21914513,"This paper focuses on the use of the short-form health survey, the Self-Question and Well-being Questionnaire, as an outcome measure for patients with newly onset schizophorenic disorder. The results suggest that patients can expect to improve their physical and mental well-being at least initially when they receive treatment. In contrast, a longer-acting antipsychotic such as elzapine has been shown to be more effective in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life in patients with new illness."
26075896,"In this paper, Concluson demonstrates that allantoin permeates through the interstices of scarred skin, allowing for normal barrier recovery. He concludes by stating that topical creams such as hydrogen permeate throughout the scarring site and are more effective than any other type of topical treatment. The results of these studies suggest that topicals can be used to prevent or delay scar formation in post-opportunity wounds. For example, contractubex has been shown to be more effective at preventing excessively thick scars than it does at reducing scar size. This suggests that physicians should focus on their patients' location, lifestyle, and readiness to undergo scar treatment."
22944525,"Conclusions This paper presents the results of a literature search and suggests that the American knee-arthrostrinite score, the Harris hip score, may be a useful measure for evaluating patients with ostearthritis."
27714852,This paper focuses on the association between physical activity and academic performance in children and young adults. It uses a case-control study to examine the relationship between physical fitness and school performance in adulthood. The results suggest that exercise training may be an effective treatment for depression in older adults.
21733480,"Homeopathy is superior to placebo in reducing pain and improving quality of life for persons with a myalgic condition. Two other studies report that homeopathy improves attention-deficit disorder in children. In one study, 62 patients with ADHD were randomized to either verum or placebo for six weeks. After the initial treatment, they improved significantly under both conditions. The results suggest that homeopathic treatment may be more effective than conventional medication in treating these patients."
16034880,"In this chapter, we describe the results of a double-blind, en-consensual study on two different antidepressant drugs for the treatment of headache. We conclude that both are effective in treating pain and improving quality of life in patients with tension-type or chronic migraine. Although neither drug completely eliminates the pain, it does provide a significant reduction in the severity of the patient's symptoms."
31097278,"In this paper, the authors present evidence for the use of nurse-led health management to improve blood pressure control in patients with low-resource setting. They conclude that it is possible and cost effective to use a nurse led approach to manage hypertension in poor settings. The results suggest that lifestylemodifications are associated with improved blood pressure levels in Indian women. Nurse-led care can improve secondary preventive measures in coronary disease. This study also suggests that community-based approaches may be more cost effective than usual care in managing chronic conditions."
16861726,"This chapter discusses the role of antioxidants in preventing and reducing free radical damage to red blood cells in patients with chronic hemodialysis. It is concluded that this treatment can be used to prevent or delay the onset of anemia, but it does not seem to improve the quality of life for these patients."
20226989,"In this paper, Gulliver discusses the latest developments in blood pressure medicine. He outlines the most promising new drugs for treating heart attack and their possible side-effects. The only trial to date that has shown a substantial reduction in stroke risk in patients with high blood pressure is Allhat, a large, randomized, open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy of different classes of antihypertensive agents. It was first published in the late 1990s as an attempt to determine which class of drug would have the greatest effect on preventing heart attack. Although there are some drawbacks, these include diuretics, hypokalemia,hypomagnesemia, hyperuricity, hyperphospholipidemia, insulin resistance, and ectopically unstable anginapies. These results were not supported by prior studies. Instead, they were largely due to adverse effects of other treatment regimens, such as diuretic or calcium antagonists. Finally, it was concluded that all three classes of agent could be more effective in reducing the risk of sudden myomyocardial arrhythmia than one another."
17293469,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights uses a novel approach to examine the effects of menstrual and post-menstrual cycle changes on the risk of acute cruciate Ligament injury in female athletics. He concludes by describing several possible treatment strategies that might reduce the severity of these injuries."
26818198,"In this paper, the authors present a new measure of health state utility for patients with naivete. They use a pre-specified disease severity scale as an outcome measure and then apply a modified version of the Swedish Uveitis Questionnaire to derive utility values from medical records. The results are very similar to those reported in other studies, but there are differences in the fit of the measures. This paper also discusses the use of condition-specific preferences-based measures such as the European Asthicidal Questionnaire or the Preference-based Measurement of Health-Related Quality of Life."
31217991,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of a large-scale irrational heart failure study. We conclude that patients with severe atrial fiilation who receive Cryptectomy have no benefit in terms of survival and morbidity. However, there are some drawbacks to the trial: it does not reduce the risk of death from heart failure; however, it does lead to similar benefits in patients with acute or chronic heart failure. Furthermore, convalescent therapy is superior to ablation for patients with heart failing."
30819123,"This paper focuses on the association between overweight and obesity in Malaysian children and young adults. It uses a mixed-response model to examine the relationship between body weight and physical activity in relation to these two risk factors. In particular, it suggests that an unhealthy diet is associated with increased body apposition and greater risk of developing Type 2A and Type 2B over the next three years."
26783103,"In this paper, Bariatric surgeons are able to use an exercise program to induce changes in the body's physiology and function after long-term treatment. The results of this study suggest that weight loss can be used as an alternative to conventional therapy for patients with morbidly excessive weight who have not yet recovered from their disease or injury. This paper also discusses the effects of physical activity on health after surgery. Although there is some evidence that physical activity improves blood pressure and heart function in patients with severe obesity, it is not clear whether these changes are permanent or temporary."
30893346,"In this paper, Dr. Rivers discusses the prosthetic options available to patients with a partially amputationd leg. The prostheses have different advantages and drawbacks depending on the patient's individual needs. For example, some patients find that walking with an electric ankle prosthesis is more cost-effective than walking without one. However, there are also differences in the length of the prosthesis as well as in the amount of time it takes to walk. These differences can be explained by the difference in the size of the prosthesis itself."
31477081,"This paper focuses on the use of split-mouth sealants in children to prevent and arrest caries. It uses a split mouth technique to assess the efficacy of different types of sealants for protecting teeth from both acid and fluoride attack. The results suggest that the carbon dioxide-laser should be selected because it has better enamel resistance than conventional methods. In addition, this study suggests that air-absorption is more effective at reducing microleakages than either self-etch or acid-etching techniques. Conclusions Fissure sealed with etch/reinse Adhesive showed better retention rate than those placed after acid nor Er : Cr :YSGG diamond etching were similar"
27490013,"The results of this study suggest that a brief course of antimicrobial treatment is superior to a longer course of antibiotic therapy for post-opportunity fractures. Conclusions In this paper, the authors conclude that there are no significant differences between the timing or duration of an antibiotic regimen in terms of infection risk. However, they do note that it is important to remember that studies with high risk of bias may not be included in these studies."
19821434,"This paper focuses on the side effects of two patients taking a combination consisting of rerpine, thiazde, and sotalola. Although this treatment is more expensive than conventional monotherapy, it does have some drawbacks: 1) there are no side effects when taken in large doses; 2) all studies need to be well-recorded; and 3) only one patient develops side effects while other patients do not."
26407688,"Conclusions This paper uses a fall risk assessment tool to assess the association between falls and medication use in older adults. The results suggest that both drugs are frequently over-used and under-used among older men, and that it is important for physicians to be aware of these risks. A communication gap exists between older adults and their physicians regarding prescription drug use."
22044842,The results of this study suggest that physical activity is important for people with knee ostearthritis because it can help to preserve function and reduce morbidity.
25132078,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of our previous studies on atrial ablation. We conclude that a long term follow-up is not necessary for patients with persistent or permanent ailment because they have still recurrent atriotic synapsis after their first year of treatment. PVI isolated plus ll is superior to PVI alone in maintaining sYnapsis without anarrhythmic medication. Conclusions The success rate was significantly higher than fluoroscopie times in the groups with large isolation places around both pvs. Adjuvant anterior lesions do not seem to improve procedural outcome among patients with paroxismal or persisting AF. Conscious of the fact that early relapses may be associated with negative outcomes after PVI only but not after additional SM, conclusive evidence suggests that it is best to use empiric and SVCI as well as PVAI to achieve improved efficacy. This study shows that bi-atrial cathter ablation has the greatest likelihood of maintaining SinusRhythm in patients with perpetual persistent af. RFA does not improve left atrium LVEF; however, it does improve"
24715614,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the importance of training duration and intensity in elite male soccer players. He concludes that endurance training is more effective than other forms of training because it can lead to greater gains in strength and speed. Furthermore, Anderson's results suggest that young men may benefit from short bouts of intermittent activity during their pretraining period as well as from longer periods of interval training. Anderson also suggests that heart rate-monitoring should be used as a means of gauging actual exercise intensity during athletic competition. Athletic physicians should use performance-related measures such as the Physician's Score or the Post-Doctored Score to help predict injury in professional sport. This study furthermore examines the relationship between fatigue, injury, and illness in adult male football players."
25652888,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of physical therapy to improve functional outcome in patients who have been in the ICU for more than three months. The results suggest that early mobilization may be an effective treatment for these patients. However, there are still some concerns about the safety and efficacy of this type of intervention. For example, loss of muscle mass is associated with reduced quality of life at one month's time but not at six months' time. Furthermore, both severity of illness and presence of acute paresis during the awaken period are associated with elevated intensified care unit and mortality. This needs further investigation. Finally, Anderson concludes that ""muscle weakness"" is common after lung injury and usually recovers within twelve months. He also suggests that mechanical ventilation can be used as a predictor of long-term recovery."
30795740,"This paper focuses on the use of water-based exercise to prevent falls in older adults. It uses a mixed-restraining and community-based approach to assess the effects of this type of exercise on balance, stepping, and gait. It concludes by describing how it can be used as a preventative measure for older adults who are at risk of falling due to changes in their strength, balance, and ROM."
31129504,"The results of a weight-loss incentive program are presented in this paper. In the control group, there is no significant difference in mean weight loss over the course of the twelve-month period; however, incentives do lead to increased physical activity and higher energy expenditure during the fall semester. This suggests that employers should look for alternative approaches to motivate weight loss. However, financial incentives may not be as effective as individual-oriented strategies. Post-hoc analysis suggests that exercise needs for successful long term weight loss are much higher than those usually recommended in behavior treatment programs. Conclusions Financial incentives produce significant weight loss while an eight-month intervention was not entirely sustained."
20091622,"Heart rate is not associated with death in women of middle-aged age. However, it is important to note that heart rate is an important risk factor for the mortality of young men and women who have a high blood pressure. In this chapter, we examine the effects of different antihysteriasive agents on blood pressure control. A combination of e prosartan 500mg and HTZ 12.5m was found to be highly efficacious; however, some side effects occurred. The major side effects were heart failure and chest pain. E prosartan combined with HTZ12.5m resulted in greater reduction of blood pressure when compared to monotherapy. This study also showed that switching from V/HcTZ combination therapy provided an additional lowered bp comparing to dose increase of the drug in patients without BP in sufficiently controlled by M.F."
26359361,"The narrator concludes that there are no serious adverse events in the daily high-frequency rtms of M1 for patients with central post stroke. A guide is then developed to help authors decide whether to include only studies with low risks of bias or not. In this case, they should avoid taking an approach that ""averages across studies"" because it will be more likely to have a higher risk of bias than other studies."
21210910,"Conclusions In this study, the safety and efficacy of a combination of alpha- blockers and toltersodine in men with bladder obstruction are demonstrated. Men with BPH or Luts may be suitable for initial treatment or after failed therapy with alpha blocksers. The results suggest that long-term combined therapy with either doxazoin or Finasteride is safe and reduces the risk of Overall Clinical Progress of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia considerably more than does treatment alone. Nighttime ter dosing relieves urgency-related Micturitions and improved Urinary Perfunctory Scores in patients with Ob and noctura. Acute Uriny Retention was not associated with any significant changes in Urodynamic Parameters; however, these changes seemed not of clinical significance because they did not involve urinary retention but rather were due to lack of subjective discomfort. This study concludes that so lifenacin plus an alpha blocker is effective and generally safe as treatment for men with lower Urological Tract symptoms."
25084562,"This paper focuses on the relationship between physical activity and health in girls and boys. Boys are more physically active than girls because of their close association with social and environment factors, while girls tend to be less physically active due to their proximity to schools and other external barriers. It concludes that an active game intervention has little effect on body composition or weight in overweight and obesity children. However, it does lead to improved health-related qualities of life for older women who attend home-based exercise classes. The results suggest that ""home-based training"" for frail old women using an outdoor exercise program induces lasting quality of life. Although this study is not directed at smoking, it suggests that there may be some positive change in the family's food environment as well as changes in behavior."
30621667,"In this paper, Cortes et al. present the results of an eight-week exercise program for children with mild to moderate asthma. He concludes that strength training and aerobic training are safe and can be used to improve physical function in children with severe CF. Children with less fit asthma have improved their health by improving their absorption of fluids and increasing their resistance to disease. This suggests that exercise training may be useful as a preventive measure against overweight and obesity in childhood."
22701014,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study that examined the effects of daily, weekly, or monthly doses of high-dose vitamin D on blood pressure and risk of heart attack in post menopausals. The results suggest that daily doses are not sufficient to prevent hypertension from developing; however, higher doses do seem to have a protective effect on these risk factors. Furthermore, there is no association between total amount of vitamin D and 25HhD levels with breastcancer risk. Finally, it is concluded that daily dosages of 1,200 iu/day are inadequate for preventing fractures among older people who live in an institution."
30953508,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effect of regular daily exercise on health-related quality of life in older adults who are not physically active. He concludes by stating that it is necessary for further studies to confirm the efficacy of regular yoga in older people without specific medical conditions. The evidence base for these studies does not yet exist; therefore, additional high-quality rcts need to be performed before any conclusions can be drawn. After six months of Silver Yoga exercises, sleep quality, depression and health status were all improved after the intervention. However, there was no relative improvement of physical function among healthy older adults in the silver group or the 55-min shortened silver group. This study suggests that short-duration Thai Yoga exercise may be as effective as other forms of exercise for improving Posture Stability. It is suggested that low- income minority elders should be more frequent with structured leadership so that they can adhere to their daily routine which may lead to mental and physical change"
20008054,"Conclusions This paper presents the largest randomized trial to date of a new type of daily weight-and-symptommonitoring device for patients with acute heart failure. Although no difference in primary endpoint of re hospitalization rates is seen, mortality is reduced for patients who adopt the Alere Net system without an increased use of advanced practice nurse care. A further study should be performed to determine how best to use distance technology to better track and predict future readmissions. Telemedicine can also help reduce costs by reducing the need for frequent rounds of follow-up."
29305228,"The results of a long-term, placebo-controlled study indicate that reveratrol may be an effective treatment for atheroscy. In particular, it reduces the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by reducing blood pressure and reducing lipoprotein levels. However, there is no significant change in body weight or waist circumference between the two groups. Furthermore, this study does not show any changes in other measures of health. It concludes that these studies are important because they provide information on the efficacy of different forms of anti-cancer medicine."
28655354,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-assisted study compared the safety and efficacy of analgesis with a combination of glucotosteroids and other anticonvulsive agents in knee and hip replacement patients.

28488684,"In this paper, Prosero demonstrates that improving the status of women with Type 2 diabetes results in improved sensitivity and reduced secretion of blood. However, there is no significant interaction between the two groups for changes in blood pressure, lipid levels, or other risk factors. These conclusions do not support using vitD-supplation to reduce heart disease risk."
29542875,"In older men with limited mobility, tyrosterone is associated with improved physical function and reduced risk of injury. Short-term tepsal therapy improves muscle strength in healthy older men but does not improve body composition or functional performance. Four weeks of Intrmuscular T replacement in patients with advanced malignancies did not improve their quality of life; larger studies are required. Transdermal T treatment prevents bone loss, decreases body fat, increases lean mass, and improves mechanical muscle function. Both testosterone and placebo showed gains in lower leg muscles, but neither group was able to increase PSA levels. The four-site protocol could be improved by the addition of upper arm muscle thickening, so that it would be easier to apply at the bed side. These results suggest further studies should be performed on this population of elderly men with low testogen levels."

17370290,"In this paper, Stonehill et al. concludes that family-based therapy is superior to longer-term inpatient treatment for adult patients who have been anorexated for more than a year. They also report that the use of grade-d exercise does not improve weight gain or body fat at any point. The results of these studies suggest that ""supplements"" are not as effective as adequate nutrition and do not reduce short-term gains of body fat nor BMI. Conclusions Short-term treatments appear to be better than long-term ones for adults with anorexic nervoses. However, it is suggested that those with severe eating-respective thinking and other nonintimate families benefit from extended treatment. This study furthermore suggests that social skillstraining within the established outpatient treatment program would lead to greater recovery from Anorexia Neervosa by one year's follow-up measured by the percent matched population means weight of the patient. These results support the effectiveness of citalopram in improving depression, obsesolate-compulsive symptoms, impulsivity, and trait-anger; however, they do not provide sufficient evidence for the effic"

23742732,Conclusions The results suggest that short-term oro-inositol treatment may be an effective strategy for treating encephalopathies.
26477805,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the use of an ""electrified version"" of decision support systems in treating patients with hypertension. Although it does improve laboratory and manual testing, it does not lead to improved blood pressure control or absolute risk reduction. In addition, this system does not result in improvement in other aspects of patient care such as A1C or blood pressure management. The results of this study suggest that physicians should be more attentive to their patients' needs rather than trying to fit them into a narrow box of medical knowledge."
31771586,"The results of a small, well-controlled study suggest that high-dose vitamin D may be an effective strategy for improving the health of young athletics. Although this intervention has little effect on physical performance, it does improve bone health in these young men. In addition, there are no significant changes in irrational phosphorylated glutathiase levels after exercise. This suggests that low 25-hydroxyd is associated with increased susceptibility to saropenia; furthermore, reduced 25-OH dilutes the blood supply, making it more difficult for the body to absorb and metabolize the active form of the drug."

Although there is some evidence that this treatment can improve school performance, it does not appear to have any beneficial effects on children with mild or moderately ill attention problems. It is recommended that ""core outcome sets"" be used as a set of endpoints for all trials and national surveys."
28209944,"Conclusions Using a combination of cynical force sensing and conventional ablation approaches, the authors present a novel approach to atrial fibrillation that uses a newer, more energy-efficient technology to achieve greater efficacy than conventional methods. They conclude that this new technology can be used to significantly reduce the time and cost of ablation for patients with parosmal atrial fever."
27492688,"Conclusions Most patients with left side THA reach their pre-operative baseline six weeks after surgery, and most of the patients do not have a tbr limitation 8 days postopmentally. Because of these patients' high individual rehabilitation course, it is necessary to examine and recommend appropriate driving techniques. Immobilization seems to have little or no effect on driving ability in healthy subjects, but may adversely affect response to routine dangers. A driving simulator that can predict future crashes appears to be an inexpensive way to screen out troubled older drivers before they go through a more expensive road test"
23970372,"A supervised walking program is superior to a shorter exercise program in improving walking ability in patients with moderate to severe chronic claudications. In contrast, strength training does not improve walking performance for patients with mild to moderately severe intermittent clacudication. Conclusions This pilot study suggests that a short two-month exercise program might be preferable to long-term exercise therapy because adherence and use of equipment are higher per patient. Conscious of the high cost of personnel and uses of facilities, more patients may be trained for an appropriate amount of time. Walking distance was the only measure of improved quality of life after attendance at classes had ceased. Confused by the differences between better walking performances for both groups, conclusive evidence suggests that home-based exercises are more effective than unsupervised exercise. Home-based exercise also improves physical health in people with Type I and Panic/Adulterous disease. The effect of supervised exercise on blood flow seems to be related to changes in resting heart rate. After six and 12 months, patients with interrupted clausdication benefit equally from either Endovascular Revascularization or Supervised Physical exercise training. Both types of exercise seem to work on"
25848335,"Conclusions In this paper, the results of a large-scale, long-term prospective observational study are summarized in order to justify further investigation into adjuvant treatments for early breastcancer. Adjuvant therapy with anthrogacycline is not superior to single anti-Her2 treatment in terms of disease free and overall survival. However, patients with high tumor sensitivity may be better off receiving only one type of adjuvenient therapy instead of two. The French National Cancer institute has decided to continue the trial until late 2013, after which time it will be mandatory for any patient who has a positive prognosis."

17389701,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates that elevated levels of the pro-diogeny factor, c-rp, are associated with Type 2 diabetes. He also suggests that diets high in both phosphorus and vitamin D may reduce the risk of developing Type 2 by reducing body weight and fat. Although these results do not appear to improve blood pressure or other measures of health, they suggest that higher dairy diets may be more effective in preventing Type 2 from developing."
23903267,"This paper presents the results of a prospective observational study on patients receiving epidural or general anesthesia. The authors conclude that this technique is more effective in reducing blood loss and improving post-surgery outcome when compared to other methods. They conclude that it is better for patients with localized prostatutes to receive epidual anesthesia rather than general anestry, as it reduces blood loss while also reducing the need for transfusion. Furthermore, these results suggest that spinal anesthesia may be more successful in relieving pain and speeding up the recovery after major surgery."
30977740,"This paper presents the results of a large-scale, randomized, controlled trial using wearable devices to track physical activity in overweight patients. The results suggest that wearable technology can be used as a ""behavior change driver"" for people with obstructive gynecological disease. In this study, we examine the effects of wearable activity tracking devices on weight loss over six months in women with a body mass greater than 40. Although the wearable device does not have an immediate effect on weight reduction, it does lead to improvements in physical activity at several months."
29260583,This paper focuses on the use of balance measures to predict risk of falls in people who are walking. It uses a self-reporting approach to track changes in balance over time. The results suggest that balance measures may be useful in predicting future falls for people with multiplesclerosis.

This paper discusses the pros and cons of different types of restorative materials used to restore primary teeth. The most promising material is compomer, which outperforms amalgam in terms of long-term survival."
29940543,"Conclusions The relationship between body mass index and short-and long-term outcome after chest re Vascularization is described. In our population, obesity increases perioperativemyocardial infa ring ion or septaemia after cardial surgery but doesn't influence in- hospital mortality. Concliusions This study shows that BMI can be used as an independent risk predictor of death and morbidities after cardiac surgery. It also suggests that patients with high BMI may be at higher risk of dying than those with low BMI."
32172501,"In this paper, the authors present a first-ever study of cannanbinol in patients with moderate to severe pain. They conclude that it has modest but ""clinically relevantanalgeic"" effects on central pain and that it may be useful as an alternative treatment for patients who are not well tolerated or sensitive to other drugs. There is no significant adverse effect on cognition nor mood during the first two weeks of treatment. This trial supports consideration of further studies that would include larger scale studies over several weeks to month to evaluate theefficacy of medicinal canninods in chronic pain. The results suggest that could be used as second line treatment for these patients. A small, short-lived, placebo controlled trial of dihydrocotinol showed a dose dependent reduction in peripheral nerve pain in patients suffering from rheumatia. Conclusions That Nabilone should be added to GBP as an adjuvant to pain management in patients experiencing multiple scratching pain. These conclusions suggest that additional studies need to be performed to confirm these results."
28914815,"Conclusions A culturally-tailored approach to improving control of Type 2 diabetes among low- income Latinos was not found to have any effect on blood glucose control. However, a combination of short-duration self-management and group-based education was associated with improvements in physical functioning, psychological distress, and medication adherence. This study is needed to confirm these promising results."
28826569,"In this large, uncontrolled b-controlled study, the authors conclude that statins are safe and effective for preventing acute myocardial events in patients with moderate to high risk of heart disease. They follow-up results from a prospective, randomized, double-blind, f-tick-over-the-horizons randomization of 1,100 men and 2,800 women who had been on statin therapy during the previous year. The results suggest that greater adherence to regimens is associated with improved blood pressure control, reduced LDL-c levels, and increased risk of sudden death among patients with low adherence."

26556568,"Conclusions The use of ACE-inhibitors in older subjects appears to be more effective than diuretic treatment in reducing blood pressure. In particular, the effect of amiloride-hycrosolozide is somewhat greater than that of triamiterene-hychlorothazide; however, the difference is small and does not significantly increase the risk of adverse events. Adenomas are less frequently associated with elevated blood pressure when compared to patients who are not at high risk of such events. Concluusions Use of an Enac inhibitor combined with HTZ for treating hypertension in elderly subjects seems to have favorable effects on chest and scd outcomes. However, there is little evidence to recommend initial or addon therapy with an antihypertinergic agent in persons with chronic kidney disease."
31618207,"Conclusions In this paper, we present the first evidence from a population-based study of psychological disease in India. We find that people with elevated blood glucose can benefit from an eight-week program of physical and mental exercise. Consistently, these results lead to improved weight loss and reduced waist circumference among Indians with high blood glucose. This suggests that there may be a genetic susceptibility to Type 2disease as a result of ""environment pressures"" in susceptible individuals. A randomized controlled trial is performed to assess the effects of 8-week self-regarding yoga on patients with Type 1disruption."
28715727,"This paper focuses on the safety and efficacy of fluoxetine in treating bipolar I disorder. It shows that fluoxetine is safe and effective, but it also has some drawbacks: it does not lead to relapses, and patients with a high-manic switch rate are at greater risk of recurrence. The use of mood-stabilizers did not seem to be associated with an increased risk of altering the patient's behavior. Longer term outcome studies need to confirm these results."
28768649,"In this study, the authors conclude that a daily dose of 200mg of soy-isoflavones for 2 years does not protect against bone loss or improve physical performance in women who are premenopalausal. However, they suggest that it is possible to attenuate bone loss through an individual's ""quol-producing capacity"" and thus prevent future bone loss. They conclude that there is no overall protection from fracture in older women because of the negative relationship between dietary proteins and bone turnover. A three-year trial suggests that red clover can be used as a safe and effective treatment for early menopause; however, these trials do not show any beneficial effects on bone mineral loss."
21056534,"Conclusions In this report, the results of a prospective surveillance study are presented. Only one patient with favorable disease has experienced a preventable death and two patients did not receive immediate treatment. A combination of high-dose irradation and transrectal anecdote was found to be highly effective in reducing the risk of dying from prostatecancer. Although there is no difference in the detection rate or severity of symptoms between the two groups, it is clear that the preferential approach for initial prostatectomy is the transverse approach. Pelvic nodes were well tolerated although did not improve prognosis. The addition of Endorectal Mammography contributes significant improvement to thekattannomogram for prediction of SVI. Conscious of the fact that men with localized disease may have greater risk of developing metastases than those with locally advanced disease, RRP is a good treatment option. Protocolary needle biopsy reduces the risks of infection by significantly improving survival. Adjuvant retroartistically rebuffed PSA therapy does not improve overall survival but does not lead to any significant change in outcome."
23543567,"In this paper, the authors describe a new approach to patient management of Type 2 diabetes: ""telemedicine case-management"" that uses real-time blood glucose results and an option for making telephone consultations. They conclude that it can be used in primary care as a way to improve patients' health. A telemedicine system is cost-effective but does not have a significant effect on reductions in Medicare gl aims. However, a larger randomized trial is being planned at the Boston VA Healthcare system to determine the efficacy of this new approach."
17636684,"Aspirin has a significant beneficial effect on the secondary preventive effect of atheothromboic strokes in patients who are similar to those prescribed by the study's authors. In addition, aspirin is not associated with any reduction in the risk of major stroke or heart attack. However, it does have a protective effect against these events. The only drawback for this group is that they often discontinue trial medication more frequently than other patients on aspirine alone. This concludes that both combination regimens should be used as antithrobitetic therapy after cerebral Ischaemia of blood origin."
29334343,"In this paper, the authors present a meta-analysis of the effects of diet and exercise on infant idine levels. They conclude that direct supplementation is not as effective as it was previously used in improving infant health. Women with adequate body mass and Uic are more likely to have sufficient iodin concentrations. The results suggest that women should be carefullymonishing their naivete about how much they eat and whether or not they are deficient in mg/d. A subset of women with high ion concentrations also have greater risk of hypothyroiditism during pregnancy. This study supports the notion that breast milk is preferable to giving preterms an enriched formula."

31328245,"In this paper, Lithium is shown to be a safe and effective treatment for bipolar disorder. It has been used for 70 years in some parts of the world, but its use has declined due to concerns about its side effects and potential for interactions with other drugs."
17253526,"Bipolar I is a disorder of the ""full range"" of affective symptoms, and patients with early warning signs are at risk for relapsism. Family-based treatment seems to be more successful in reducing relapse than medication alone. However, family-based therapy does not lead to improvement in overall patient performance. In addition, bipolar II suffers from a greater number of maniclike comorbidities than does bipolar I. This suggests that tricyclic therapy may be useful in treating these patients as well."
30926099,"This paper focuses on the efficacy of two different types of endodonte, Biodedentine and Mineraltrioxide aggregate, in treating primary morals. Biodentine is more successful than MTA for both localized and deep-seated wounds; however, it does not show any significant differences in the success of either technique at three or six months posttreatment."
19959485,"In this paper, we present the results of a long-standing debate on how best to use integrated approaches to improve health outcomes in different contexts. Some argue that ""integrated"" approaches may be more cost effective than ""non-integrated,"" while others advocate for more 'integrated' approaches."
26876624,"The results of a novel lifestyle intervention for type 2 diabetes show that it can reduce the risk of heart disease in patients with Type 2 who live in rural areas.

23450577,"In this paper, the authors present a new approach to physical activity education in American Indian girls. They conclude that ""Mildly endurance training"" can be used as an effective intervention for improving body composition and health in overweight African-American boys. The results support the notion that muscular strength is improved during the early years of childhood. Athletics are only weakly related to bone formation but a short period of endurance exercise leads to substantial increases in bone formation marker in young men. A multilevel program could prevent excessive weight gain among low-society black children. This study confirms the feasibility, acceptability, and potentialefficacy of using dancing classes and family-basedintervention to reduce television watching, therebyreducing weight gain in African Americans girls. Conclusions These conclusions support reducing school-basedprimary prevention programmes; however, they do not have any effect on children's behavior other than modest increase in vegetables. Children's consumption of vegetables does not seem to affect their behavior either at school or at home. For example, parents consume less calories, eat less salt, and walk further than control families. Both groups show positive changes in several aspects of fat-related knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. However, neither group"
28153024,"In this chapter, we present the results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of statin and fibrate in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

25236307,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the safety and efficacy of two different probiotics for the treatment of preterm premature infants: B-breve and Li-casei. They conclude that early gut colonies with beneficial bacteria are more effective in preventing late-onset enterocololitis and sepis than conventional treatments. The use of either probiotic or placebo is not shown to reduce the risk of death or non-ECC in preterm babies. However, there is some evidence that probiotic administration can improve growth velocity by reducing the severity of these complications. Early-onset censure remains an important yet uncommon problem among vaginal newborns. Although probiotic regimens increase growth velocity, they do not prevent severe Necrotizing Enterocolitis at birth."
31114271,"In this paper, Anderson identifies several of the most common barriers to improving self-care for Type 2 patients. These include lack of knowledge of target blood sugar and blood pressure, poor awareness of these conditions, and low levels of depression. This paper concludes that an interdisciplinary approach to patient care can be more cost effective than a one-on-one approach with telemedicine. However, it is important to note that there are some limitations to the use of such a single approach among patients with Type 2, especially those with multiple chronic conditions."
25008420,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of regular physical activity on older women. He concludes that exercise is an effective intervention for improving balance and strength in older women who have mild balance impairments. Although most health authorities agree that 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity will improve many health outcomes, few controlled studies have investigated whether doing more than the prescribed amount will result in additional benefits. This study suggests that there are dose-relationships between exercise length and numerous health outcome results in post menopatrasal women, including cardiovascular exercise, body mass, body composition, waist circumference, and sleep disturbances. Conclusions The results indicate that frequent physical activity can represent an important protective factor for age-related decline and disease in elderly people. Affected individuals with greater initial physical function tend to be less likely to suffer from chronic ADL disuse. However, as the number of physically active individuals increases, the risk of disability decreases. Conscious of the potential of community-based exercise regimens to prevent these conditions, Anderson recommends that they be included in primary care."

29909748,"Conclusions The telemedicine system achieved better control of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes patients than the standard care regimen. In addition, it was found that there was no increase in the risk of hyperglyciaemia during the six-month observation period. Conscious of the small size of the sample, the study concludes that telemonitoring can be an effective tool for controlling Type 2 diabetes in primary care settings. However, this study does not conclusively because of the short observation period and the small sample size. This paper suggests that ""telehome monitoring"" is an effective way to control Type 2 Diabetes in aprimary care setting. It also suggests that iBGstar's treatment of some patients with hypoglycies improves their overall glyceric control. A further study is needed to determine whether or not the use of auto-titration devices can be used as a stand-alone method of treating Type 1 Diabetes."

25841251,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, open-label, random-experimentation study on blood pressure control in overweight patients. We conclude that home blood pressuremonitoring alone does not have any effect on heart disease. A nurse led treatment program with web-based activity reminders improved blood pressure by nearly 18 percent among participants at higher risk for cardiovascular disease and by nearly five % among those at high risk. This suggests that an ""electrified"" patient may be better able to reduce his or her risk than usual care. However, short-term effects were limited. The intervention was independent of the use of communication mode. Short-term results did not improve blood pressure; however, long-term studies found no evidence for their lifestyle intervention as effective in preventing cardiovascular risk in healthy overweight subjects. Thus, we concluded that our lifestyle intervention had little effect on improving blood pressure. Our conclusion was that it was more physically active during follow up than receiving usual care: use of the Cardiofit program could extendthe reach of Rehabilitation and secondary preventive services. Conclusions and Reneval An exercise-based self-management program showed efficacy against weight gain among Sociecially deprived black women."

They conclude that this is an effective and cost-effective method of managing hypertension. They also report that there is no difference in the ordering of diagnostic tests or treatments between the two types of encounters. Telemedicine results in improved blood pressure control over a 12-month period. This will be particularly useful for African Americans who live long distances from the doctor's office."

Conclusions The results suggest that short term surface nerve stimulation via transcutaneous electrodermation may have the role in treating detrusosor instability; future studies must examine how this effect might relate to longer-term surface nerve modulation. All three treatments are equally efficacious: 1) weight loss 2) physical activity 3) acupuncture 4) neuromodulation 5) percutaneous nerve stimulation 6) botulinium toxinA ) and finally 4) ""low intensity behavioral therapy""."
26130315,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a large-scale, long-term, i.e., prospective study of combined HRT in women who have been postmenopause for more than 10 years. The results suggest that combination HRT can improve health-related quality of life by improving mammography, breast density, and other risk factors for breastcancer. Women who had started using estrogen soon after their menopause had similar effects on heart disease, stroke, hip fracture, and total malignancy but were not associated with improved mood or anxiety during the period of treatment. This suggests that there may be a need for additional studies to confirm these results. Estrogin replacement therapy is not as effective as transdermal ester replacement; however, it does lead to improvements in brain function across several different age-related domains. Conclusions Estrogen replaces vasomobil symptoms but also induces menstrual pain. Estrosel has a positive effect on both physical and mental well-being among older females."

12137717,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the effect of feeding infants exclusively breastfed for at least four months to reduce the risk of developing asthma and other childhood atopies. He concludes by stating that ""the probability of breathing illness occurring at anytime during childhood is reduced if only breast feeding is given for 15 weeks."" The results are important for public health in Australia because it will help to reduce both the burden of asthma and the severity of the disease. For example, exclusive breastfeeding seems to have a significant lower incidence of asthma than soy or cow's milk. However, there is no benefit from replacing cow'milk with soy when used as a treatment for allergic disease."

30383133,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a large-scale, long-term, single-arm study of efficacy in patients with atrium fibrillation. We conclude that warfarin is superior to dabigaran in terms of its antithrombotics, but not for its ability to prevent systemic or major bleeding. Conclusions are made regarding the safety and effectiveness of both regimens of aspirin in treating patients with acute atrial fiilation. For example, patients with chronic anemia have a higher risk of stroke than those without it. Both regimens were also associated with lower risks of major bleeding; however, they did not result in significant increases in major bleeding during either regimen. These conclusions suggest that rivaxaban may be used as an alternative against warfarn in patients who have had a stroke."

32111637,Conclusions The results of this study suggest that a combination of brief group psychological education and self-reporting measures can be effective in treating patients with functional neurological disorder. This evidence supports the use of the EPS-25 as a measure of change in patient outcome after BAPit treatment.
25886655,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a large-scale, long-term, i.e. single-blind, random-effects study on children with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. We conclude that treatment with methylphini date or Clonidine is safe and effective for treating these symptoms in children with ""comorbid"" tics. Conclusions furthermore suggest that combination of morphine and MPH can be used to treat both mild and severe symptoms of ADHD. Both treatments work well; however, there are some patients who experience side effects due to increased dosages. Conscious of the potential for safety and efficacy, it is recommended that physicians use caution in prescribing either medication."
25831962,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the use of the 5-item, well-being-index, as a tool for assessing patient's well being. It uses a single-dimensional scale to track changes over time and thus aids in comparisons between patients and treatments. Conscious that alcohol is not common among people with sickle leaves, future studies need to examine how this can be used to predict major depression in older adults.

32346802,"In this paper, we present the results of a novel study on the use of saffreon as a preventive treatment for patients with delayed-onset mammostesis. The results suggest that a 10-day suffron capsule can help to prevent the dostoevsky-like symptoms of the disease. This is due to the fact that it has been shown that sfron can improve endurance performance in older men. Furthermore, there are no significant differences between prophylactic or over-the counter doses of anti-inflammatory agents when used together with resistance training. Finally, we perform a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of NSAids on sports performance."

It concludes that PVI is superior to other methods in maintaining syphilis free after only one year of follow-up; however, it does not reduce the risk of death, stroke, or dementia among these patients. In addition, PVI has a lower risk of fatal and stroke events than either drug regimen. Although this trial did not reveal any specific cause of relapse, it suggests that there may be an advantage in using such a device in patients with chronic heart failure."

21404024,"This study concludes that cementless and cementless cups are more frequently used than cemented hip replacements. The results of the previous two studies indicate that there is no difference between the prevalence of osteolysis in both groups. There were 14 revisions to the original Charnley prostheses, indicating that they will last for at least three decades. Cementless fixes have been advocated as an attempt to reduce the risk of bone resorption. However, these methods have their disadvantages and indications. After ""Enderera,"" significant differences are noted between the different groups; cementless or cementless implants impact on the patient's health-related qualities of life. In this study, the patients who had the cementless mallory-head capsules required more changes of the stem than those who had them with cementless components. These patients had greater pain in the ft. At one year, 24 percent of the patients without a cup allowed ingrowth did not suffer from pain. The incidence of migrating the capsules was greater in the camented capsules than in those with a glass cup."
32314257,"Conclusions This paper confirms that treatment with moxificillin is equivalent to conventional therapy in terms of reducing body weight and improving general health. However, this does not mean that the drug is equally effective in treating patients with severe obesity."
32350578,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft demonstrates the use of gap-balancing to improve the post-opportunity for patients with knee pain. Gap-balanceing increases the joint line in order to restore a normal patellar position after total knee resection. This technique does not lead to a significant change in quality of life over 24 months. A significant relationship was found between ""neutral limb alignment"" and higher Kss only in patients who had preoperative nonvarus or constitutional varus Alignment is still debated. Level of Evidence Diagnostic study; Level II Conclusions Gap balancering results in better early clinical outcomes than conventional surgical techniques."
26146874,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to predicting drug-recovery in patients with a genotype of DRD1 that expresses an allele for the opioid receptor. They use a combination of molecular and apoplectic markers to investigate the role of the DDR1 allele in alcoholism."
18199086,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft elucidates the effect of early and brief breast feeding on infants' risk of developing asthma in the first two years of life. He concludes by stating that it is important for public health to ensure that babies are fed exclusively for at least four months before they are born. The results suggest that exclusive breast-feeting may reduce the risk of asthma from age 6 to 18 months. Atopic disease is more common among infants who have been breastfed than those who have not had a history of asthma. Lactobacilus GG appears to be an effective anti-atopy treatment; however, there is no benefit in using soy or cow milk during the first 12 months of life because these studies do not show any protection against atopic illness."
27769955,"In this paper, Anderson systematically reviews the evidence for the efficacy of an evidence-based web-based approach to self-management for people with Type 2 diabetes. It is clear that Web-based approaches are more effective than traditional approaches in improving patient well-being."
26552695,"This paper presents the results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial on the effectiveness of an individual worksite intervention program to prevent neck and upper-limb pain in workers. In particular, it is shown that this program does not lead to significant reductions in pain or symptoms from pre-to-post measures. However, there are some positive effects with regard to receiving education and improving physical health. A further study is needed to determine whether stretching exercises can be used as a preventive measure against lower-extremity injury."
17943751,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of consumption of soy extracts on women's health. He concludes that there is no difference between European-American and Japanese American women in terms of their hot flush frequency. The results of two large randomized trials, the Heartand Estrogen Progestin replacement Study and the Women's Health initiative, indicate that the risks of using estrogen and progesterin are outweighing the benefits of continuous regimens for women taking both forms of therapy. Although these studies have not yet been published, Anderson suggests that changes in use of hormonal therapy may be due to differences in patient characteristics. For example, older women tend to take more than one type of treatment, while younger women tend only to take several different types of treatment. However, because mammography is an evidence-based practice, it is important to examine whether change in use has occurred by patient characteristics as well as by age or gender. This study uses logistic regression to estimate the effect of each individual woman's current use of Hormone Therapy over time. It shows that although flax seed and wheat germ reduce menopatra's severity scores, they do not significantly affect blood cholesterol levels. Furthermore, neither does"
28368091,"Conclusions The results of this study provide evidence for the efficacy of hypnosis in treating patients with mild-to-moderate agitation. In addition, it suggests that deescalation may be an effective treatment for people with moderate to severe mental illness."
32340106,"This paper presents a detailed description of the mechanical and physical properties of two different types of glass post-posts. The first is self-etched Mdp-based cement, which has the highest pushout bond strength; the second is potent Permanganate, which improves the bond strength but does not reduce the size of the dowel. The third is full-etching system, which results in higher forces at the surface of the post. The recommended method for testing the bond between glass posts to Intraradicular Dentin is through Mpo technique. However, this study cannot be used as an endodontic reference because it does not include teeth that exhibit coronal wall."
27798366,"The results of this study suggest that home-based heart-rehab is superior to regular outpatient exercise in terms of reducing the risk of stroke and improving quality of life for patients with low-risk heart disease. In addition, it has been found that home exercises are more effective than usual care in improving physical health and function in patients with mild-to-severe coronary disease."
32198100,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the effect of pre- and post-surveillance measures on patients' comfort during surgery. He concludes that ""hypothermies themselves may delay healing"" and that maintaining a constant temperature in the operating room will prevent complications from occurring. However, it is important to note that these precautions are not sufficient to prevent spontaneous spontaneous throbbing or infection after open-thoracic or hip replacement surgery. Wollstercraft also discusses the use of remote wound photographs as an aid in detecting syphilis."
24564520,"This paper focuses on the use of financial incentives to improve health in low- and middle-class families in Mexico. It uses a mixed-effects approach to examine the relationship between cash transfers and improved health outcomes for children under five years of age. In particular, the program has been found to have a significant impact on improving early childhood development."
17563549,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed description of the different effects of various antihypertinesive drugs on blood pressure. They conclude that amlo dipine is more effective at reducing BP than valartan or hychlorothizide alone; however, they do not find any significant differences between the effect of these two agents on BP and post-dissipation. The results suggest that all three are equally effective for reducing blood pressure in mild to moderately hypertension. All three are well tolerated during the study period. Although their efficacy depends on the patient's response to the treatment, it is clear that each agent has an advantage over the other. For example, e prosartan can be used as a stand-in-waiting solution for patients with severe essential hypertension who are unresponsive to conventional therapy."
30861690,"Conclusions In patients with acute coronary disease who have a low-high-Dcholesterol level, analctrapib reduces the risk of heart attack but does not reduce the severity of the event. The use of cettol inhibition with dacetrapibus reduced the incidence of major chest events and did not increase the rate of major strokes. A combination of eezetimibe or simvastain was more effective in improving lipid levels than either treatment alone. However, it did not improve blood pressure or cause any significant changes in the overall health of the patient."
24918321,"Conclusions : This paper concludes that the use of VSL#3, an over-the-top probiotic, is safe and can be used to treat moderately active U.C. in patients who are not treated with 5-ASA or other anti-inflammatorants. It also shows that it seems to improve rectal bleeding after eight weeks of treatment."
24814519,"In this paper, Conlusion demonstrates that the Ankylos prosthesis can be used as an early loading device for patients with poor bone quality and high-resorption. He concludes by describing the results of a two-centre study in which he compares the success and survival of implant-loaded Straumann SLA implants to those of conventional loading. His conclusion is that ""immediate loading"" of 2 or 3 implants in the patient's maxilla does not compromise the integrity of the final prosthesis."
25178118,"Conclusions In this paper, we present a meta-analysis of 370 random drug trials that have been published in the Coachrane library. The results suggest that funding and conclusions are more likely to predict treatment effects than adverse events. A significant positive relationship between funding and conclusion is observed for trials funded by non-profit or for-profit organization. This suggests that studies funded by for profit organizations may be less likely to recommend an experimental drug as ""treatment of choice"" than those funded by charity. We furthermore conclude that these studies do not reflect treatment effect nor adverse events; rather, they report only the primary outcome."
27717522,"In this paper, we summarize the results of our previous studies on combination therapy. We conclude that it is a good idea to use two different drugs in treating men with lower Urinary Tract symptoms. For example, one drug can be used to treat mild or moderate symptoms while another could be used as a treatment for more severe symptoms. So lifenacin 6mg plus Tocas significantly improves storage and/or sexual function in men with low-to-moderate symptoms. This Fdc also improved storage pains and quality of life in patients with high-tolerability symptoms. Conclusions That single half-dose Silod Ocas does not significantly improve either voiding or sexual dysfunction in Japanesemen with lumstruts suggestive of basal cell disease. Conscious that there may be some side-effects from using alphablockers alone, we do not report any such side effects. Men with ""buff"" symptoms who have been treated with alpha blocks show greater improvements in their diary variables, Ipss Scores, and Storage Scores than they did with other treatments. The study concludes that both monotherapies are equally effective in treating upper-triumy tract symptoms"
24694271,"In this paper, we present the results of a single-arm hip arthrostomy with a modified short stem design. We conclude that it is possible to achieve good long-term survival for patients with this new type of prosthesis. However, there is still uncertainty as to whether survival rates match current standards."
28887086,"In this paper, we describe the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the effects of 1 g of Cinnamon in subjects with Type 2 diabetes. The results indicate that consumption of 1 to 3 g per day improves blood lipid levels in people with Type 2, and suggests that the addition of these ingredients may be useful for treating Type 2 patients."
29322626,"In this article, Anderson reviews the latest developments in restorative technology. He discusses the use of a new type of crown called ""Hall Technique"" for treating children's primary teeth. This new technique has been shown to be very effective and can be used as a stand-in-waiting treatment for children with caries who have not yet recovered from their injuries. The results of this new technique are described in this paper. For example, SSCs were found to be much more successful than amalgams at recapturing large amounts of tooth tissue after only five years of use. Conclusions These crowns combined the durability of conventional stainless metal crowns with better esthetics. They also proved to be highly successful for patients with severe caries. However, there was a significant increase in the frequency of replacements due to recurring caries over time. Composites seemed to be superior to amalgams in terms of long-term survival. Both materials showed acceptable results in Class I and II dentitions after 24 months of follow-up. All three material had similar failure rates; however, they did suffer from secondary caries that resulted from loss of retention during the course of the study."
30387072,"This paper focuses on the efficacy and safety of a novel form of resistance training for older adults: high- speed resistance training. It has been reported that resistance training can be used to prevent falls, fractures, and even improve quality of life in older adults."
27997978,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a double-blind, sfooriated, and open-label study of the efficacy and safety of three different drugs for mild to moderately hypertensive patients. Although side effects are rare, they do not occur in all patients taking either drug. Both regimens were equally effective at reducing blood pressures but did not produce any significant changes in heart rate or other measures of vitality. This suggests that treatment with low doses of both agents is a good alternative to conventional first-line therapy of hypertension."" Conclusions furthermore suggest that diuretics can be used as a preventative measure against major forms of cardiovascular disease. A full-scale study has been prepared to evaluate the benefits of these two drugs in mild hypertension."
23514337,"Conclusions The results of this study may be used in pre-opportunity counseling for patients with a reduced oxygen saturation during their pre-ecdotal exercise test, as well as other measures of outcome such as the risk of developing an EOD below 100 %. In addition, it is recommended that patients with low levels of oxygen consumption undergo a formal exercise test to determine whether they will survive the operation or not. These results suggest that the hydrogen breather can be used as a simple and inexpensive test of muscle strength in older people. This paper also discusses the use of a modified stair climb test as predictors of heart failure in patients with early-stage lung cancer."
26512340,"In this study, Wuthering Heights's ""uplift pilot study"" confirms that older people who are depressed can be successfully enrolled in a community-based posturgy program. The odds of getting into the hospital are lower among the intervention group and the decline in barthel score is greater with time. This suggests that exercise may improve endurance, strength, gait, and function as well as reduce the risk of falling in elderly people with low physical functioning. A change in physical selfesteem predicts changes in depressive conditions. Although antidespressants may help to lessen depression after 16 weeks or so, exercise seems to be equally effective in treating patients with mild-to-moderate severity."
24671713,"Restorative materials are used to restore lesions for five years in this study. There is no difference in the material's retention after three years, but there is a slight improvement in the coloration of the lesions at 3 years. The microfilled composite and the glass-Ionomer filling material meet the Acceptance program guidelines for dentin and enamel adhesives. After 5 years, the total retention rate is 96 p.m.; however, some of the patients lose their restorations during this time period. In contrast, all of the other restorative resins show good results up to three years. However, they do not have significant differences in the patient's resistance to enamel staining. This paper also discusses the different types of bonding agents that can be used to repair lesions. These vary according to the type of esthetic material being used. Some use an acetone or water-based adhesive while others use a single-button system. All three Adhesive systems perform with acceptable results over a 36 month period."
25324324,"This paper describes a patient-centered, evidence-based approach to improving blood pressure in patients with hypotensive heart disease. It uses a case-control study to evaluate the efficacy of a home-based health education program for patients with high Feffief levels. The results suggest that this intervention can be used as a low-resource setting within the existing health care systems of India."
24118784,"In this paper, we present the first results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study in which we assess the effects of long-term daily treatment of 1,800 iu of vitamin C on blood pressure, cell wall reactivity, and wound healing in Type 2 diabetic subjects. These results support our initial hypotheses about the efficacy of short-term treatment of high-doses of alphatocotherol."
26708317,"In this chapter, we present the results of a double-blind, feigning placebo-controlled study in which subjects were given 200 milligrams ofmodafinil for eight weeks. The subjects showed no significant changes in their performance on long term memory or executive function tasks when compared to placebo; however, they did show improvements in short term visual recognition memory and verbal recall. Furthermore, these results suggest that it may be useful as a treatment for attention-deficive hyperactivity disorder because it increases cortically active brain regions involved in learning and remembering. This is an important finding since it suggests that patients with anxiety are at greater risk of overdose than those without such conditions."
28110383,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a large, well-conclusive pool of evidence on the safety and efficacy of mesalamine as an anti-recurrent treatment for patients with acute diverticulus. We conclude that it is possible to prevent recurring lesions with short-acting antibiotics, but there is no way to prevent them from occurring in the first place. Conclusions furthermore suggest that prophylactic surgery should be considered in cases of severe diversion."
16435593,"This paper demonstrates the efficacy of an occupational therapy intervention in improving patients' health and quality of life after stroke. It concludes by comparing the effects of a self-management program with that of an education and therapy intervention. Although both approaches have been shown to be effective, they do not compare well in terms of long-term benefits."
19533517,"In this paper, we present a summary of the first version of the ""Trend"" statement that describes the reporting of evaluations with non-regular or omised design. We find that pain relief is related to sleep and rest, but not change in pain intensity. This suggests that there may be a role for pain management and rehabilitation in reducing depression in persons with spine injury."
29637113,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which probiotics were shown to reduce the risk of developing necrotising Enterocolitis among prematurely breved infants. We conclude that probiotic treatment is safe and can be used as a preventative measure against early-onset enterocololitis."
23584278,"This paper focuses on the effects of physical and mental load on the muscles of office workers. It is shown that there are slight differences in the amount of muscle activity between mouse actions, target directions, and between Precision Dem and S. In addition, there are minor differences in forearm strength during mouse use. The study concludes that working with a machine can lead to changes in the body's response to stress."
31049758,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of several recent studies on advanced non-Squamous lung cancer. The most important finding is that Erlotin in combination with pembrozumab improves overall survival in advanced patients with pd-l1-mutated disease. Furthermore, there are no significant differences in response rate or free survival between first-line ceritanib and second-line docetaxela. Finally, we conclude that bevacisumab can be used as a treatment for elderly patients who have been treated with other agents."
28258777,"Strong Healthy Women's behavior change intervention was found to be effective in preventing pregnancy and weight gain, but it did not improve physical activity or eat into women's health. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the incidence of stroke among men and women who received the intervention. However, this evidence does not support the use of multiple-behavior changes as a strategy for improving health behavior. The most promising intervention was a brief lifestyle change program that included print communication, telephone motivational interviews, and a low-cost physical activity program. These studies failed to identify any specific moderator of the intervention's efficacy; however, they identified several other types of intervention that merit further investigation. For example, a short video doctor intervention could improve exercise and diet habits in pregnant women during pregnancy. Although these studies did not find an immediate effect on smoking, they suggested that continuing contact with counselors may have prevented anxieties about weight gain and discouraged cessation after weight gain. This particular intervention is ineffective at universal drug prevention. Conclusions That particular adapting of MI isineffective as ""universal drug prevention."" Trial registration Current controlled trials is RCT."
20416377,"In this paper, we examine the use of morphine as an anti-psychotic in college students. We conclude that it is more common among certain sub-classes of U.S. college students and Types of colleges than other forms of drugs. This suggests that there may be a need for further research into the uses of these prescription stimulants. The results of the study indicate that abrupt changes produced some sleep disturbances during nightshift work but that larger doses of methylphini date were more detrimental to sleepiness than those of other drugs. These findings suggest that sudden shift changes produce cognitive performance improvements and mood disturbances while administered during day shift work. Both drugs have beneficial effects on working memory; however, they are not suitable for patients with age-related decline."
29696144,"This paper describes the results of two different types of knee prostheses. The first is a posterior-stretched type, while the second is an all-in-one prosthesis. Both are good in terms of pain and function, but they have some drawbacks: They don't fit well on the cruciate Ligament, and they can't move with the ball or socket because of their small size. Finally, they find no superiority in the ""mobile bearing"" type of prosthesis for patients younger than 50 years old with Ostearthritis."
27882320,"The results of this study suggest that a low-sugar diet can be used to reduce the risk of heart disease in men. In addition, it has been shown that fish oil and red yeast rice are more effective at reducing total and LDLcholesterol levels than any other treatment. Furthermore, these results suggest that olive oil may play a key role in preventing oxidative degradation of lipoproteins."
26712512,This paper reviews the evidence for the use of active games to motivate older adults with Type 2 diabetes to participate in physical activity. It concludes that using these games can be used as a preventive measure against type 2 disease.
29320437,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective observational study on females in Karachi, Pakistan. We find that high levels of vitamin D are common among women and that it is important to know how much it is low so as to be able to use this information to predict future risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. This finding supports our previous conclusion that low levels of 25-hydroxyvincrisy may be associated with increased risk of Type 2 disease."
28718394,"In this final chapter, we summarize the results of a single-arm, random-effects study on sertraline for the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis. Although there are no significant differences in efficacy between the two groups, it is concluded that sertrasol is superior to placebo in terms of tolerability and safety. Furthermore, studies have shown that serotonine can be used as a stand-alone treatment for patients with severe depression."
27074871,"Conclusions In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the costs and benefits of an alcohol intervention in a large-scale, long-term, i.e. population-based setting. We find that treatment with methadone is more cost effective than usual maintenance for patients with recurrent alcoholism."
28302405,"This paper presents the first results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, febbering study of the efficacy of an elevated c-reactive-protein diet in reducing blood pressure in elderly subjects. These results suggest that C-reactment may not be as effective as other risk-factors such as high-cholestrol and low-scaroused diets. Furthermore, this study suggests that consumption of lean beef can reduce blood pressure by reducing ""the presence of increased crp"" --that is, increasing the amount of fat in a person's body."
27530471,"In this paper, we describe the effect of morphine on Type 2 diabetes in patients with neuropathy and coronary disease who are not well controlled. We conclude that more prolonged use of magnesium is needed to prevent or delay long-term complications. A high dose of magnesium seems to improve blood pressure in type 2 diabetics but does not have any beneficial effects on other important end-organ diseases. Furthermore, there is little evidence for the efficacy of oral magnesium in treating non-indisciplined types of diabetes."
24577409,"In this study, the effects of a daily physical activity intervention on blood pressure are examined in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 hypertension. The results suggest that lifestyle changes can be effective in reducing blood pressure in these patients. Acute exercise training is more effective than long-term restorative exercise for improving blood pressure control among elderly patients with stage I and type 2 disease."
21912106,"Conclusions This paper concludes that an irrational, high-fat diet can be very effective in preventing Type 2 diabetes in people with high risk of heart disease. In particular, the LCM diet is superior to the ADA or tm in improving blood lipid levels and improved glycemia control. Conscious of these results, Concliusions suggests that this type of diet may be especially beneficial for patients with Type 2 who are at greater risk of both heart disease and stroke."
25855678,"Conclusions Long-term use of carvedillol in the treatment of patients with left-ventricular dysfunction after an acute Myocardial Infa Rct Ion is associated with reduced risk of mortality, sudden death, and severity of heart failure. These benefits are additional to that of evidence-based treatments such as ACE blockers or diuretics. Atrial Fibrillation is an indication of worseprognosis After acute myocoral infacultation complicated by left ventric sytolic dysfunction. Conscious of these beneficial effects, long-term treatment was found to reduce the risk of all cause and cardiovascular mortality, and revoked recurrent Non-fatalmyocardialtia ions. The results from the current trial suggest that amlorodipine doesn't seem to improve the outcome of patients suffering from heart failure regardless of their underlying chest disease. This suggests that there may be some need for caution when striking benefit is observed in sub-specified groups of patients."
28898559,"This paper focuses on the use of short-term motivational reinforcement to improve health status in patients with moderate to high risk of cardiovascular disease. It concludes that this intervention is particularly effective when it is used to treat patients with elevated risk ofCVD. However, it does not appear to be an effective intervention for patients with low levels of risk."
26885157,"In this study, Wuthering Heights systematically compares the wear of six different bearing surfaces in patients with hip arthrosis. The results suggest that the bearings are more wear-proven than those of conventional polyethylene, suggesting that they will outperform all other bearing materials in the future."
23744449,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the effect of iron-fortification on infants who have severe anemia. Although there is little evidence for a long-term benefit of iron therapy in improving mental and motor function in children suffering from iron deficitiency Anemia does not seem to play a significant role in the early childhood development of children with poor health."
26507525,"This paper discusses the advantages and drawbacks of using an irrational approach to total kneearthroplasty, with particular focus on the advantage of using a single-incision technique for the management of patients with severe knee pain. It concludes that this technique can lead to improved patient outcomes in the long run."
32260482,"This paper sums up some of the most recent developments in the field of idiuretics and suggests that there may be some drawbacks to this approach. For example, it is not yet clear whether or not the effect of nicotinine on salivary secretion is due to an overdose of the drug or because of poor design."
26560173,"Conclusions The results are important in two respects: first, agomelatatine is effective and safe as an antidepressedant continuation therapy; second, few early-relapses are observed in the patients switched to placebo. This suggests solely that the underlying property of the illness is only possible because the lack of interruption syndrome after agomelatine withdrawal. A further study suggests that bright light can be an effective treatment for depressed patients. Consciousness There may be some instability of the central nervous system in sullen patients with adrenergic disease. In contrast, light therapy does not lead to any significant differences in efficacy or safety between these two treatments. Sullen patient preference should be guided selection of first line treatment."
23660970,"The narrator concludes that the use of methylphini date to treat patients with ADHD may lead to improved attention and reduced distractibility. He also suggests that using this drug might be more effective in treating other, more serious, psychological disorders."
17943920,"Conclusions A randomized, controlled trial of floating spa therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumaloid arthritis was performed. The results showed no significant improvement in the laboratory and follow-up studies were made. In particular, there was no significant change in the patient's pain or activity over time. For example, tenderness and swelling joints were more significantly improved than those in the other two treatment groups. Furthermore, adding mud packs to sun exposure and dead sea baths seemed to extend beneficial effects on these patients. This study concludes that staying at the sea can be an effective and safe modality for improving health in middle-aged adults who have common health problems."
22331380,This paper focuses on the effect of high-fructose consumption on blood pressure and suggests that it may be useful in the treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes.

24549404,"In this paper, the results of a novel exercise intervention approach are presented. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of an experimental regimen consisting of GPR and stretching exercises on patients suffering from acute sprains. These results suggest that exercise therapy may be effective in relieving pain and depressed nerves in patients with assensible back pain. A multi-modal training involving McKenzie, Heckscher, and other exercises can also be used to treat patients who have been treated with tnf inhibitors. This new treatment method improves patient's symptoms and quality of life."
25510863,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of physical exercise, salt reduction, and yoga on patients with Type 2 diabetes. He concludes that these are effective ""non-poisonic"" methods for attenuating atheroscence in older subjects particularly those with high risk of heart disease. However, it is important to note that some studies have not yet been published. For example, one study suggests that a six-week program of daily exercise may be more effective than a single day of restorative meditation. Other studies suggest that such a program can reduce blood pressure in hypertensies but do not show any significant changes in body composition or mental health. Anderson concludes by stating that although there are many limitations to the effectiveness of both types of therapy, they should be carefully considered."
29169245,"In this paper, Conclusions and colleagues present the results of a prospective, i.e., open-label, random-access study of patients with hip fracture who received only physical activity during their stay in the hospital after surgery. They conclude that treatment with corroborated gaitation can lead to significant improvements in physical function and behavior in older people who are recovering from hip injury. This is especially important for older adults who have not yet recovered from an acute hip fracture."
15846636,"This paper focuses on the efficacy of 16-week and 8-week hypnotic treatment for patients with uneXplained symptoms of gastrointestinal disease. In particular, it shows that anxiety and not severe depression are the most frequently presenting complaints in this group. Hynotherapy appears to be more successful in treating these patients than other forms of treatment. The results suggest that psychological treatment may be more cost effective in some patients with asymptomatic bowel disease."
30371517,"This paper focuses on the efficacy of a combination of group and patient-centered approaches to treating patients with chronic spinal pain. It concludes that multidisciplinary treatment can lead to improved outcomes for patients with clumsy back pain. In particular, it has been shown that improvement in physical function is associated with improved coping and reduced depression."
30667278,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates that a ""home-based health coaching program"" can be used to improve physical and mental health in patients with convalescent heart disease. The results of the trial indicate that the intervention does not improve quality of life for heart disease or diabetes patients. However, there are indications that it may have a beneficial effect on both types of patients. For example, one patient's waist circumference is significantly different from another's. This suggests that such a device might be useful as a secondary preventive measure against cardiovascular disease."
31152444,"In this paper, Lithium Carbonate and Valproate are more effective in treating acute mania than either of these two drugs. They also show good tolerability for patients with manic symptoms. Both drugs seem to be equally efficacious in the short-term. However, there are some drawbacks: patient groups do not meet discharge criteria at the end of the study, which means that no significant differences can be found between the two groups. The most important conclusion is that QuetiApine is shown to be ""clinically lyeffective in patients with Bipolar disorder"". There are other side effects as well, such as nausea and weight gain. These studies only partially support the notion that divalpropex is more powerful than lithium in long-term bipolar treatment. Furthermore, it does not appear to have any antimanic or mood-stimulating effects."
20189946,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a previous study on the beneficial effects of atrium pacing in patients with sicksinus-syphilis. After long term follow-up, it is suggested that an atrial pacemaker should be used rather than a ventricular pacemaker because after long terms follow- up there is a significant increase in survival, less attrioventricular enlargement, and fewer complications. Aorvastain 40mg/d has been shown to reduce the risk of post-elective cardiac surgery by shortening the hospital stay. Conclusions That treatment with atorvarstatin prevents significant atrial fillation as well as left atrial expansion in patients without bradyartias or  implanted pacemakers. The incidence of atheritance in pacemaker patients is high; prior history of atarrhythmic events are associated with higher archery burden. Consciousness Atorva statin may prevent maintaining AF by suppressing inflammation in canine sternile pericortis model"
25803266,"Sweet Talk has been shown to be a good way to help patients with Type 2 diabetes. It also improves blood pressure control, which is important for people with Type 1 and Type 2 who haven't had the opportunity to take care of themselves yet. Conclusions The combination of behavior-mobility with blood glucose information, lifestyle behaviors, and patient health-care data individually examined and presented with an evidence-based guide to providers considerably reduced gycated hagin levels over one year. This paper concludes that ""Sweet Talk"" was associated with improvements in selfefficacy as well as adherence. In contrast, home blood pressuremonitoring alone had no effects on blood pressure but may have had negative psychological effects: ""Poor psychological effects."" Consistently, this study suggests that it is possible to use short message services such as cellular phones or nurse led-telephony follow-up to improve Hba1c levels by three months in Type 2 patients. However, both methods are not cost effective; they do not lead to improved asthma control or improvement in quality of life. These results suggest that there needs to be further investigation into how these new technologies can be used to support patients"
12695268,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind study on the safety and effectiveness of two different forms of atrial fibrillation therapy: 1) antagonized digoxin; and 2) single-oral amiodraone. We conclude that either form of treatment is safe and effective in treating patients with acute atrial fever. Conclusions are made regarding the use of these two drugs for the treatment of patients with new-onset or chronic atrial Fibrillations. For example, it has been reported that one patient can convert to sinus rhythm after only four weeks of treatment."
24018611,"In this paper, we examine the effects of a two-month intervention on patients with fms. We find that the intervention is more effective in improving their functional status than usual care and that it improves both pain and overall well-being. This suggests that a psychological intervention can be used as a treatment for these patients."
27788565,"In this paper, the authors present a new approach to feeding infants. They suggest that feeding preterm formula with either long-chain Polyunsulated Fatty acids or fish oil may be more effective in preventing childhood allergic disease and improving growth. Their results suggest that early enteral feeding is associated with reduced exposure to Intrvenous Lipids, increased En intake, and reduced Conjured Bilirubin prior to reanstomosis; they conclude that dietary consumption of Dha does not influence brain development at 9 months. However, their studies indicate that adding LCP to an infant's breast milk increases lymphocyte population, phospholip composition, cytokene production, and antigem maturity. The study also suggests that short term LCPs do not affect cardiovascular and astronomical development at nine months. Although these studies are limited, they provide evidence for the use of animal fats as a preventive measure against allergic disease."
19398930,"In this paper, we describe the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study of patients who received single-glycosidase treatment after chest thorax. We found that there was no single disease entity involved in the patient's illness, and that more than half of them had multiple glycomatose diagnoses contributing to their pain. Furthermore, it was not possible to use specific gastrointestinal symptoms as a predictor of future GI symptoms. Therefore, an algorithm is developed to track changes in bowel discomfort caused by radiation therapy."
28455363,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed description of concoussion-related symptoms and their relationship to neurophysiological and psychological changes. They conclude that patients who return to play immediately after an acute injury have a significantly greater risk of injury than those who do not suffer a severe head injury. A significant proportion of players report recurrance of symptoms or fail to match baseline nervecognitive tests during graduated recovery to play. The results further suggest that there is a direct relationship between lower blood counts and lower performance in patients with multiple sclerosis. These results may be useful for physicians to use as predictors of patient recovery after sports-related injuries."
26508743,"A naive, low-carbohydrate diet improves both body weight and blood pressure in patients with type 2 rheumatoido disease. Both diets lead to significant reductions of total and LDL-cholestrol concentrations as well as an increase in the levels of anti-PCIgm and Iga. In addition, these results suggest that there is no need for further investigation into the efficacy of such a diet."
27019254,"In this paper, we present a meta-analysis of the evidence for the use of chromium in patients with Type 2 diabetes. We conclude that it is safe and efficacious to use chemoprotective agents such as erythrin and etiamine in addition to standard treatment of the patient. Furthermore, our results suggest that chomium may be an effective adjuvant to improve blood glucose control in type 2diism."
25350225,"In this study, the long-term safety and efficacy are demonstrated in patients with low-risk symptomatic lests of benign prostatichypoplasia who have severed their urethrocytes. Tamsullosin is shown to be safe and effective for up to six years in these patients. The most important reason for satisfaction with the treatment is that it improves Urinary Tract Semproval but only one third of the patients are satisfied with it. SulosinD to Harnals D was found to be superior to other anti- androgen drugs in treating lower urinary symptoms associated withbh. This section includes papers from Japan, Austria, the U.S., and joints from France, Denmark, Switzerll and the Australia and the United States. There were no significant differences between the two groups at four and twelve weeks after treatment. Although there was no difference in the severity of the patient's symptoms, they did not show any change in the length of time or duration of the treatment. A large variety of lower uriney tract topics covered by BPH has been described. From BPH to Overactive Blading and Urodynamic Stress Incontinence"
19221376,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of our work on predicting the risk of sudden shock in women. We conclude that there is little evidence to support the use of statins as an effective treatment for patients with moderate-risk heart disease. However, we do suggest that it is cost-effective to treat these patients with high-risk or low-risk factors."
30071588,"In this paper, Conclusions discusses the potential of using irrational reinforcement to treat patients who have traumatic brain injuries. He uses a case-control study to evaluate the efficacy of pre-operative and post-surgery training for patients with adolescent onset of psychiatric disorder. His main conclusion is that virtual reality can be used as an effective treatment for children with autism."
20927745,"In this paper, the authors present a single reader to time-sequence and compare the results of two previous studies. The outcome of treatment for benign prostatichypoplasia is predictable from the patient's prostate volume. Both treatments are well tolerated by patients with similar risk of adverse events. A sub-group analysis of several randomised trials confirms that finasteide is safe and efficacious in treating symptomatic men with benign Prostacia. Although there are wide variations among patients, it is concluded that finAsteride can reduce symptoms and improve quality of life."
23790149,Conclusions The results of this study suggest that modest weight loss is associated with reduced risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in overweight adults. A Mediterranean-inspired  diet improves blood lipid levels and reduces the risk of heart disease in healthy subjects. This suggests that a complete approach to preventing Type 2 disease should include a high-quality Mediterranean diet.
20099019,"Conclusions This paper extends the previous study by comparing the efficacy of homeopathic treatment to placebo in patients with fms. The results suggest that homeopathy is more effective than placebo in relieving tender point pain, improving quality of life, and improving the overall health of persons who have affixed to this condition. Concluusions These conclusions suggest that prefrontal electrodes may be useful as early predictors of individual response to homeopathic medicine."
26122377,"In this paper, we describe the use of a split-mouth technique to assess the performance of two different restorative materials in three-year studies. The results show that both materials perform well after one year and that they do not suffer from significant degradation over time. However, there are some drawbacks with regard to post-opportunity. For example, the self-cured Quixfil Restorative material does not differ in terms of sensitivity or marginal adaptation. Both Adhesive Stimulation and Post-Operative Sensibility are found to be significantly worse than those treated by Type 1 and Type 2 due to the presence of the center. A 2-year follow-up study is necessary for further evaluation of these new materials."
28490031,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of several recent studies on bupropion and climpramin. The most important finding in this study is that brofaromire is superior to placebo when used at high doses. Conclusions are made regarding the safety and efficacy of these two new anti-depressants as well as the use of Hamilton Depression Rating scales for assessment of severity."

26098509,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the use of a checklist to assess the quality of observational studies in order to better understand the relationship between physical activity and eating habits. Conscious of the importance of screen time, however, it is not yet clear whether this can be used as an intervention or preventive measure."
29733052,"This paper discusses the results of a work-recovery program that was designed to improve return to work for people with mental and physical illnesses. It concludes that this program did not improve workers' ability to perform well in the workplace. However, it did lead to better health and improved work performance for patients with both mental and musculotic disorders. The aim of this study is to develop a provincially-based approach to work rehabilitation."
29767225,The balance training program improves balance and reduces the risk of falls in older women with Ostoprasis. This study demonstrates that balance training can be an effective intervention for older adults who have a history of falls.
28042114,"In this paper, the results of a single-arm hip replacement procedure are summarized. The first author's experience shows that there is no significant difference in the dislocation rate after the enhanced-closure technique when compared to the conventional approach. Conclusions A larger articulation leads to a reduced incidence of displacement during the first year follow-up for the Poliarcup dual-mobility system. There is one revision for supsis29 months after surgery, and one undisplaced fracture. This study suggests that using a large head with a polyethylene liner reduces the chance of dislocation from two to five years. These conclusions suggest that cementless dimaculate kneecaps can be suggested as an alternative to total hip replacement."
16606807,"In this chapter, the authors discuss the pros and cons of treating asymptomatic patients with syphilis. They conclude that dofetilide can be used as an effective first-line treatment for patients who have relapsed into atrium fibrillation because it is safe and does not cause side effects. However, there are some drawbacks: quinidine has a higher risk of side effects than other antiarthrotic agents; flecasinide is more likely to be stopped due to side effects rather than being safely tolerated. Conclusions A number of studies have been performed on the use of proventol in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. These include a single-blind, placebo-control study comparing the efficacies and safety of both propaftenone and sothalol when used for short-term preventive treatment of recurrent arrhythmic occurrences. The results of these studies suggest that long-term regimens of either drug should be considered for patients with severe heart disease."
30945127,"In this paper, the authors present a new framework for predicting health state utility values from a patient-specific population. They use a combination of Bayesian and fuzzy-regression methods to predict utility values that are comparable to those found in other studies. The results show that the HUI-3 Mapping function is superior to the Cland or GLM Mapping functions in predicting quality adjusted life years for Cost-Utility studies."
11034761,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights et al. concludes that the efficacies of three orally-administered 1mg of vitamin K in infants were superior to those of other studies because of delayed growth and immaturation. The results support the conclusion that IVK should be given prophyically at birth as a preventive measure against newborn bleeding. Furthermore, Wollstonecraft suggests that VK may be more effective than its parenteral form since it delays the maturation of important coagulationfactors such as vitelka II. This is further supported by the fact that Turkish infants have higher PIVK-II concentrations on the first day of life than European infants. These results suggest that VIK might be useful for preventing premature bleeding."
30293909,"The results of this study suggest that daily doses of 20,000 i.d. are not sufficient to prevent fractures in older people with heart failure who have low levels of 25-OH D. In addition, the use of mow therapy does not lead to significant changes in knee pain scores over two years. Conclusions and Reneval Although higher weekly doses do not improve bone mineral density or muscle function, they do not reduce falls. A monthly high-dose IVD supplementation is associated with reduced risk of falls without any increase in fracture incidence among elderly people living in institution care. Conscious of patients with severe falls, upplementing with four months of 5,000 IU per week does not result in an improvement in bone mineral dentition; however, large studies need to assess the effects of a combination of vitamin D and calcium on bone health for persons with multiple sclerosis."
31021537,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of two recent randomized controlled trials. First, Eternal-Timopalb treatment for patients with Joas showed significant improvement over time in terms of disease activity and signs and symptoms. The second trial was more efficacious than either anti-tumorous or anti-thrombus medication. Children and teenagers with polyarticulary JIA had improved their physical endurance by participating in weightbearing exercises. This study concludes that children can improve their health related quality of life by improving their exercise capacity through participation in ""weight bearing physical conditioning,"" which is an important modality to treat pain. Abatacet has been shown to be superior to TT for both long-term and short-term therapy in children with juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis. Conclusions continue to suggest that physicians should consider using pain-relief measures such as electromyographic Biofeedback to reduce pain rather than standard morphine."
31334564,"In this paper, the authors present evidence that work breaks can be used to reduce pain and fatigue in patients who are undergoing complex surgery. They conclude that three types of exercises during breaks have positive effects on Neck and Shoulder Muscle activity and productivity. The dog-videos do not affect performance, however, but decrease reports of distress; these results suggest that rest breaks may be beneficial for workers suffering from neck and shoulder pain. I-preventive is an effective preventive measure against musculonoskeletal complaints among construction workers because it encourages them to take frequent breaks. However, there is no improvement in physical health or mental health with the use of exercise reminders."
28027041,"Conclusions The results of this study suggest that the combination of pyremyd decoyal treatment and either exercise or physical training yielded improvements in most symptoms of a patient's condition. However, written emotional disclosure was not shown to have any significant effect on pain or quality of life. Further studies are needed to determine the value of these forms of self-care. Aiming for further evidence, we suggest that ""Piloquilt as an efficacious and safe method"" for people with fms."
29546180,"This paper discusses the efficacy of a school-based exercise intervention called 'up4fun' for children aged 5 to 9 years. It does not lead to significant changes in physical activity or time spent sitting, but it does lead to improvements in body size and weight."

It concludes by arguing that strong social connections may be important in predicting long-term health consequences for both adults and children."
28393328,"In this paper, Wu discusses the potential of physical activity as a preventative measure against Type 2D. He concludes by describing the effect of moderate intensity exercise on blood glucose control and suggesting that it may be beneficial for older adults to engage in moderately intense activities. The authors conclude that vigorous exercises are not necessary for weight loss but may have beneficial effects on heart health."
28752873,"In this study, Wuthering Heights demonstrates that long-term consumption of vegetable and flax oils can lead to beneficial effects on blood lipids in patients with adinocent heptoma. He concludes by comparing the effect of these two fatty acids on various blood metabolites including phospholipid alpha, ARA, and fibrinogen. The results suggest that fish oil may be an effective anti-inflammatory agent against thrombotic disease."
31583381,"Age-related loss of muscle mass and strength in older men and women are largely due to age-related changes in body composition. Women tend to preserve muscle quality better with age, particularly when it comes to the Ecc knee peak torque. The rapid increase in blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity do not change significantly after the end of this study. Sarcopenia is associated with self reported physical disability among both men and females, independent of race, age, morbidness, obesity, income, and health behavior. Consumption increases fat free mass but does not improve muscle mass in elderly people. A higher amount of phosphorus was associated with an increase in mortality; as phosphate concentrations below published targets were associated with improved survival, caution should be taken for phosphating in patients with CKD stage 3 to 4 who have low phosphatate levels. In contrast, a higher consumption of a milk-containing diet contributes to greater gainsin fat-free Mass and skeletal Muscle mass with retort in older males than did an Loov diet. This suggests that adding 210g of ribcotta cheese can attenuate the loss of lean tissue or s"
31749717,"In this paper, Cortes and Goldin describe the results of a randomized, double blinded, placebo-control study of patients with panic disorder. They conclude that dulotine is effective in treating symptoms of depression but that it does not appear to be particularly good at relieving symptoms of remitting depressed patients. Further studies need to be performed to confirm this finding."
18457601,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the effects of pre-conceceptional education on women's health and suggests that it may be useful for improving folate absorption among women of lower social class. The results suggest that there is no association between folate consumption and neural tube defect in Australia. Women who had not been informed about the correct message were likely to have eaten more than others, smoked, engaged in exercise, and planned their pregnancy. Furthermore, women who did not take adequate amounts of folate were at greater risk of having an unexplained pregnancy. A further study is needed to determine the effect of a national-wide awareness campaign on folate use by women of low-socioeconomic status."
32337708,"This paper discusses the use of folic acid as an anti-infection preventative. It concludes that it is not effective in preventing the common cold, but it does show that it can be used as a preventive measure."
22161375,"In this chapter, the authors discuss the benefits and drawbacks of various antithrombotics in patients with moderate to severe angina. They conclude that high-dose IV aspirin is not superior to a combination of low-dose warfarin or other antithrombolic agents in terms of reducing the risk of relapsed ischemic attacks. However, they suggest that long-term use of C plusT may be beneficial in treating hypertensively patients suffering from intermittenced claudicria. Although many risks relate to age, left heart dysfunction, or black race, these are all unexplainable risk factors for further investigation. Antithrombotic regimens do not seem to reduce major strokes among patients with prior acute coronary disease. The addition of either naproxen nor ibupropen does not increase blood pressure; however, it does spare prostacycline biosynthesis by the renal system. These results suggests that ""light to moderate alcohol consumed is associated with similarly risk reductions"" in both Type I and Type II diabetics. A dihydromethacin dose increases blood pressure but does not lead to significant changes in platelet function. This conclusion supports the"
30498820,"The results of this study suggest that enobarms may be effective for improving lean mass in older adults without the harmful effects of androgens, progestationals, and other agents. Conclusions In this study, we report that a combination of whey-protein and vitamin D combined with resistance training improves muscle mass among elderly women who are frail but not malnourished. This suggests further investigation into the use of specific nutrients as part of an exercise program to prevent future adverse events among older adults risked for disability."
28057512,Walking is a promising new approach to improving health and quality of life for adults with learning and intellectual challenges. This first-in-man trial demonstrates that walking can be an effective intervention for people with intellectual and other physical challenges.
19491064,"Conclusions The results of this study suggest that a single daily dose of vitamin D may improve the outcome of patients with typhoid infection. However, there is no association between the severity of the disease and the duration of the treatment. A randomized trial should be conducted to confirm this finding. In addition, a long-term observational follow-up would be needed to confirm these conclusions."
27528494,"This paper focuses on the importance of improving access to water, sanitation, and other systems in the health system. It concludes that there is little evidence for improved access to these systems because of the ""ethnological cultural fragmentation"" and lack of democracy. Conclusions suggest that one-time educational intervention may have some positive effects on mental health but does not affect attitudes. Aegateprotect is a reliable and effective drug identification service that can be used to identify recalled, expired, or suspicious drugs in communities where pharmacists dispense them. In this paper, we examine the relationship between increased enforcement of fraud and reduced overutilization among elderly patients who are hospitalized during the period from 1994 until 1998. We find few significant relationships with the overall analysis, however, as well as no significant differences in the magnitude and significance of the beneficial associations between different types of patients/hospitals."
29018489,"In this study, Wuthering Heights et al. shows that reveratrol can improve blood sugar levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes. He concludes that it may be useful as an adjuvant to the treatment of type 2 disease."
30324177,"Conclusions A nass-based intervention for children with chronic pain is feasible and appears to be highly effective in improving pain-related outcome. In addition, it reduces the time spent in the burns treatment by up to three days. Children who complete this program are more likely to improve their own health and behavior than those who do not. This suggests that there may be potential applications for such an intervention."
26003426,"In this paper, Conclusions demonstrates that resistance training can be an effective and cost-effective treatment for men with advanced prostrate disease. He concludes by describing the effect of resistance training on muscle strength, functional performance, and body composition in older men who are receiving androgen denouncement therapy. This study is important because it provides evidence that exercise can have a beneficial effect on both physical and mental health in patients with advanced or metastatic disease."
14718486,"In this chapter, the narrator discusses the benefits and drawbacks of different types of exercise for older adults. For example, resistance training is more effective in improving leg strength than speed of movement, but it does not improve functional function in healthy elderly people. A program of twice-week resistance training can achieve muscle strength gains comparable to three days per week in older adults; however, there are no differences in fall rates among the two groups. The results suggest that older adults may still be able to increase their muscle strength after 10 weeks of physical detraining. However, they do not show any significant changes in falls or fracture when adjusted for levels of activity. Elderly patients who are frail or have mild dementia can benefit from a vigorous exercise program. They also report improved gait velocity as well as improved balance and mobility. This study concludes that progressive resistance Muscle strength training produces substantial improvements in muscular strength, absolute endurance, andflexibility in older American women. It is necessary to examine the effect of resistance training on bone mass before further studies are made. Although resistance training has been shown to reduce pain and injury in older persons with chronic knee ostearthritis, these effects are not reported in this study."
30709362,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights concludes that a combination of lifestyle intervention and meal replacement can significantly reduce the incidence of Type 2 diabetes in low-and middle- income countries. It is concluded that these two approaches are effective at preventing or delaying type 2 disease for up to 10 years. However, it is unclear whether they will also reduce the severity of disease over time."
26858339,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of several recent studies on breast cancer risk and predictors. The most important finding in this paper is that patients with a high-risk disease who receive adjuvant treatment have a higher risk of distant scarring than those who receive nodurant treatment. We also discuss the use of immune-selective assays to predict future events in these patients. These studies will require further study before they can be used in practice."
29958304,"This paper focuses on the effects of probiotics on patients with chronic kidney disease. It concludes that there is no significant difference in the severity of the disease when compared to control groups. However, it does suggest that short-term psymbiotic treatment can be useful in treating patients with ckd."
28290160,"In this paper, Dr. Manette discusses the use of risk-awareness tools to improve patient engagement in decision making. He concludes that a better understanding of their blood pressure can help them make informed choices about treatment for Type 2 diabetes. The evidence from this study is not strong enough to convince policymakers and other stakeholders that an intervention like this will be cost effective. However, it does lead to improvements in patients' health. This trial also shows that physicians are more likely to prescribe statins when they have been trained to follow the latest risk-based risk assessment methods. Furthermore, men with higher risk tend to be less likely to change their lifestyle than women who have lower risk. These results suggest that there may be some value in using risk-assessment tools to predict future heart attack risk."
27267795,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the early-to-first-year follow-up of patients with new hip arthrostomies. It discusses the importance of early-stage observational studies to identify late- and rare events in these patients. For example, for a cup with a 1 mm migrating stem, the mean survival after 96 months is 0.96 +/- /-0.502; for an earlier-stage surgical intervention, it was p =0.0001. The aim of this study is to develop a reliable method of predicting long-term outcomes in patients who undergo primary total hip surgery."
24750271,"Twenty-year gh treatment in GHD patients induces an increase in bone mass and total body. In adulthood, the risk of death, malignancies, and stroke is reduced when compared to controls. However, there is no evidence for any beneficial effect of GH replacement on long-term health. The results suggest that a safe dose of rhumbhagh should be given to adult patients with high-denomal disease."
27186129,"In this paper, Conclusions elucidates the efficacy and safety of nootropins as an anti-convulsive drug for patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease who have not yet undergone a thorough surgical intervention. Acutely infusing 12 g piratetam prior to open heart surgery is associated with a reduction in early postoperative neuropsychological functions in both groups. These results indicate that noxracetam does not improve cognition but rather worsens the severity of the disease. This paper concludes by establishing that Piracetnam has a promising effect on the treatment of convalescent patients suffering from stroke."

28445352,"In this paper, the authors present an evidence-based approach to breast surgery that reduces overall hospital stay and improves quality of life for patients. They conclude that ERAS can be used as a preventative measure against infectious complications in postoperative wounds. Furthermore, they suggest that pulsed electromagnetic fields can significantly reduce pain and inflammation following tuberculosis. The results are similar to those reported in other studies; however, there is no difference in the severity or frequency of chronic pain after breast surgery. A pre- consultation educational group interventionimproves patients' shared decision making quality compared with routine preopératon patient education. An evidence-base protocol for infection reduction is developed. Preoperative oral carbohydrates loading reduces blood loss and increases insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is also associated with increased morbidity during postoperative recovery. Consuming carbohydrate loaded fluids prior to surgery helps to decrease the risk of developing hypoglycemia. Carbohydrate loading aids in relieving pain but does not increase the incidence of spontaneous bleeding."
27552970,"In this chapter, the narrator discusses some of the latest developments in the field of oncology, including new evidence that repeated doses of glutinin can improve LV function and exercise capacity in patients with chronic heptoma. He also discusses the potential applications of analmorelin for treating patients with cachexia. Although there is little evidence for analonelin's efficacy in humans, it has been reported that it may be used as a curative treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic breast disease."

It concludes that this intervention does not lead to improved long-term outcomes in patients with high risk of heart disease."
21496652,"In this paper, Conclusions presents the results of a two-year study on the efficacy of pulpotomies in carious teeth. He concludes that trioxide is a good choice for these patients because it has great potential for healing and can be used as an alternative to calcium chloride."
24529937,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of Vo2-peak as an indication of surgical outcome in patients with recurrent lung disease. He concludes that short-term exercise training can improve exercise capacity in patients who have been confined to their bed for long periods of time. The results of this study suggest that preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation could be beneficial for patients with post-tuberculosis disease. However, it is not possible to predict the exact extent of the benefit from exercise therapy in these patients because they do not yet have adequate control over their health. Anderson concludes by stating that there are still important issues to be addressed in the treatment of patients with small cell lung tumors."

24710915,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of a high-fiber, low-gi diet on blood lipid profiles. He concludes that it is not possible to achieve the same benefits from a higher-fibricated diet in men and women who are both at risk for heart disease. The results of this study suggest that a ""high legume / high fiber"" diet may be an effective treatment for hyperlipidemia but does not lead to improved weight loss or improvements in maintenance of weightloss. This study also fails to provide any clear evidence regarding the role of beans in improving body weight. However, it does show that consumption of these foods can reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease."
23035863,"In this study, we examine the effects of feeding infants a formula containing either probiotic and/or prebiotics in terms of growth and health during the first six months of life. Our results suggest that early-infancy infants are better tolerated and safer than breast-fed children. Probiotics seem to have a protective action against both allergic and infectious diseases; however, it is not yet clear whether this effect will last beyond the initial period of intervention. The authors conclude that these studies provide some evidence for the use of prebiotic or probiotics as anti-disarrehea treatment in infants."
28079254,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the safety and drawbacks of using long-term dosing with beta blockers in patients with severe coronary disease. They conclude that it is important to use such an extended-release regimen because it can lead to significant side-effects. However, they note that fibrinogen has been shown to be independent risk factors for subsequent cardiovascular death in men with moderate-risk heart disease. Furthermore, their results suggest that fibrinogen, D-Dimer levels, and Fact VIIc each have potential to improve the prediction of Coronary disease/Implified stroke in middle aged men. These conclusions warrant confirmation in large randomized trials. Conclusions This study will determine whether endovascular repairs are preferable to elective repair in patients whom have an aborted ruptured small AAAs at least 5cm in diameter. The outcome of this trial will provide information on the effects of emolol treatment in chronic beta blocker uses for tight heart rate control and reduced ischaemia as well as details on safety precautions"
25686893,"Conclusions This paper concludes with a summary of the evidence supporting the use of amalfibulation as an effective method for preventing post-opportunity shunt scarlet fever. It is necessary to confirm this effect in a larger, randomized, multi-centre study. Concliusions The no- touch technique protocol as recommended herein is safe and effective, and may contribute to a reduction risk of post- surgical infection. A large randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm that this approach is effective. Irirrition alone, and not antibiotics contributed to theprophylaxid prophylacy of spond infection. Ceftriacexone and sixt showed comparable efficacy on preventing meningits after vp surgery. Mortality was higher in cefasolin group than in other groups.

Further studies need to be performed to assess the association between these risk factors and infection in patients who underwent initial CSF sut"
18797052,"In this paper, we discuss the results of a literature review on the efficacy of topical hypnytoin for the treatment oftrophic lesions in patients with pleprosy. Although improvement in reporting quality has been found in recent studies, it is important to note that some methodologies may still be useful in future studies because of their importance in avoiding biases. This paper also discusses the use of blinded assessment as an assessment of wound progress."
15330925,"This paper focuses on the efficacy of psychological treatment for patients with unrequited gi complaints. It shows that there is no advantage in 16-session or 8-session treatments over 16-week treatment, but that those who are suffering from relatively severe depression improve more after 16 sessions than after 8 weeks. Hynotherapy seems to be an effective treatment for these patients. In particular, it has been found that those with persistent abdominal pain do not respond well to this treatment. Concluusions suggests that psychological treatment may have short-term effects as well as long-term benefits in patients with bowel disease."
21328298,"In this paper, we summarize the results of two recent studies. First, we report that laparoscopic coloanal aortectomy is more effective than open colectomy for colon cancer. Second, we conclude that fast track postoperative care can reduce hospital stay and complications in patients with colon-cancer. Third, we discuss the Lafa-trial, a three-arm study that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of an ERAS-based regimen for patients with malignant disease who have been treated with conventional care. This trial was designed to assess whether the ERAs program could be used as a stand-in-waiting strategy for improving patient recovery after colonosctal surgery."
26864742,"The results of the king study suggest that there may be an independent association between gout, pain, and disability. Conclusions This study suggests that wearing good cushioning and motion-control can reduce foot pain in people with congested knees. A method for detecting bone erosion using conventional computed tomography is now required"
18843614,"In this paper, the first two chapters of Conclusions are summarized and compared with results from other studies. The conclusion is that exercise can be used to improve leg pain in people with a myeloping condition."
27755209,"Eight weeks of resistance training does not lead to significant changes in body composition, muscular strength, or functional capacity in older adults; however, it does lead to improvements in balance and fall risk factors. In contrast, a six-week resistance training program does not result in any significant change in physical function or muscle mass in older people. This suggests that exercise can be used as a preventative measure against falls for older people who are at risk of falling. A literature review reports on the effects of exercises on muscle strength, body composition/physical functioning, and inflammation in elderly adults."
29686540,"Conclusions The cost of a fall-prevention program is justified by the results. However, there is no evidence that this intervention will save money in terms of improving quality of life for older people who are at risk of falling. Costs result from falls make way for large proportions of the hospital bill. A home exercise program has been shown to be effective in preventing falls among older adults when delivered by an experienced nurse. Both the Home and Nurse-led Care approaches appear to be safe with no significant adverse reactions."
26836148,"In this paper, we describe the effects of morphine on women's luteal and menstrual function after smoking a placebo. We conclude that marihuansana may lead to adverse effects on reproductive function in women who are addicted to cocaine. Furthermore, allo seems to play a key role in these effects by influencing both stress-relief and drug craving."
26239041,This paper focuses on the effects of financial incentives on prescribers to improve quality of care and reduce costs. It uses a case-control study to examine the effect of an incentive-based system on physician practices in four European countries. The results suggest that fundholders are better able to control their outpatient visits and receive more favorable treatment for their patients.
30002686,"This paper focuses on the effects of magnesium on sleep quality. It concludes that a low level of magnesium is associated with poor sleep quality, but it needs to be further studied to determine whether this is due to an overdose of magnesium or a lack of it in one's sleep."
21733234,"In this paper, we summarize the results of two large randomized controlled studies. The first study showed that sertraline was safe and efficacious for the short term treatment of patients in panic disorder; the second study showed no significant differences between group at post-treatment or 6 month follow-up when compared with placebo. This paper also discusses the role of exercise in treating panic disorder. It suggests that exercise may be useful as an augmenting strategy for patients with anxiety disorder who show limited response to initially pharmacotherapies."
29676540,"In this study, Wuthering Heights et al concludes that n-3-PUFAs are safe and can be used as anantibetic treatment in type 2diodyssey patients with a high risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. They also report that the addition of EPA and Dha to the diet improves blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma TG levels in subjects with Type 2Diose. These results suggest that there may be potential applications for these fatty acid-supplements in weight loss therapy."
28741090,"In this study, we examine the efficacy and safety of two different drugs for the retreatment of patients with obstructive epitheliosis. We conclude that both treatments are effective and safe; however, some patients prefer tadasalafil because of their lower risk of side-effects. Although both treatment groups are well tolerated, there are still some potential drawbacks."
26138144,"Conclusions The safety of using sedation-free toxin is a good practice in the office setting. However, there are rare cases of uti after flexible endoscopes and no significant differences in the rate of Uti between prophylactic and nonprophylactic methods. A large prospective randomized trial evaluating the use of prosphylaxics in patients prone to urinary infection has been performed. In this paper, we summarize the results of a single-dose study on the efficacy of prophylic antibiotics in reducing the risk of developing urotoxicosis after an outpatient treatment."
19277652,"Conclusions The results of the two groups are similar, with no significant difference in Component position. This suggests that using an inferiorly apprehensive approach does not lead to long-term risk of complications. Conscious of the lack of evidence for these two approaches, the authors decide to conduct a single-arm study to compare the safety and efficacy of both approaches."
28394643,"In this paper, the authors present a meta-analysis of ten randomized controlled trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of aspartamie in preventing or reducing body weight. They conclude that there is no evidence of an acute adverse response to such a sweetener in humans."
30025880,"Neck pain is the most common cause of work-related pain in workers in Australia. Although there are some risk factors that can be adjusted for, these include increased mobility and frequent exercise. Conclusive results suggest that neck pain causes most pain and activity limitation in workers. There are no preventative strategies available to reduce the frequency or severity of neck pain. However, it is important to note that a large number of studies have found little success in preventing neck pain from reaching the epidemic level."
20512292,"The narrator discusses the side effects of both forms of treatment for acute and chronic hypertension. Both drugs are effective in controlling blood pressure, but they have different side effects. For example, sublingual capstopril seems to be as effective as either drug at reducing blood pressure as quickly as sublingual hysteria. However, there is a significant difference in the timecourse of blood pressure reduction when compared to monotherapy. No patient develops focal neurological signs or heart failure when either form of therapy is used."
19370565,"In this paper, the authors present a sub-study of three different studies that have been performed on benign prostatichypoplasia in order to determine whether or not either treatment will be effective. The first study was a random pooled analysis of three placebo-controlled and three drug-response studies. The results suggest that saw palmerto is safe and highly efficacious for treating BPH. A combination of natural ingredients, such as cernin, saw palmatetto, B sitosterol, vitamin E, and permixon, can significantly reduce symptoms and improve quality of life in patients with mild to moderate disease. Prostaplex seems to have short-lived effects in improving Urinary Tract symptoms in Chinese men who have ""low Ury Traction symptoms"" associated with benign prostaglancholy. Permixon appears to be superior to other drugs in terms of improving urinary flow rate but does not lead to significant changes in the molecular composition of the patient's tissue."
24857402,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the efficacy of self-harm treatment in patients with mental illness. They conclude that Mact has value in treating self-haste cost effectively but that it appears to be limited to those who have BPD and somatic symptoms. Conclusions furthermore suggest that switching from one group to another was associated with worse outcomes for patients with newly onset schophrenic disorder. The results suggest that initial treatment goals should be achieved for new onset cases of schizphilis because they will be able to return significant quality of living and social function over time. Costeffectiveness acceptanceability curves indicate that rejecting Mact on traditional basis of statistical significance has a 10  percent chance of being correct in terms of costs-effectiveness"

22265381,Back pain is a very common cause of back pain and it is therefore important to treat this disease in a way that will prevent it from developing into a long-term condition.
15754663,"In this single-blind, rat-controlled study, Hamilton's depression severity score was improved by fluoxetine and sertraline in patients with moderate to severe depression. Although side effects were more frequent than those of the other two drugs, neither group gained significant weight over the course of the trial. Both groups showed marked improvements on the Hamilton Depression Rating scale but did not show any improvement on the Self-Evaluation Score. The only significant difference between the two treatment groups was in weight loss. However, both groups reported greater weight gain than their placebo group. This suggests that there is a gap between the recommended doses of antipsychotics from randomised trials and the actual use of these drugs."
21414043,"This paper focuses on the effects of a low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein diet on weight loss and risk factors for metabolic disease in patients with severe obesity. The results suggest that replacing some dietary carbohydrates by a higher-quality carbohydrate can lead to improved weight loss; however, it is important to note that this change does not occur immediately after surgery. In contrast, patients who have poor pre-surgery eating habits are more likely to lose their weight during the first three years after the operation than those who have better eating habits later on."
28968486,"In this paper, Wu et al. concludes that the use of an epitome-hysterically-potentified flavonoid can be used to treat preterm and early-onset infants with inlerance and/or symptoms of gestational reflux disease. The results suggest that EHFF should be used for treating these conditions but not as a treatment for other pathologies. This study will determine whether the partially-hydrlyzed or fully-phosphorusized formula is more appropriate for the low stomach tolerable of preterm infant children and whether feeding such a formula during the neonatal period will affect the normal development of pre term children in the later stages of their lives"
30249972,"In this paper, the authors summarize the results of a series of studies on the use of combination therapy for patients with non-alcoholic fat liver disease. They conclude that it is safe and inexpensive to take these two powerful anti-cancer drugs as part of an overall treatment regimen for patients who have fatty liver diseases. Although there are no significant changes in histology or laboratory values after four years of active treatment, vitamin E and alphatocotherol seem to be more effective than placebo in treating children with nasal deficiency. Children with NASH should be given either short-term intervention or a long-term combination of metformin and zealous antioxidants."
31168050,"In subjects with Type 2 diabetes, consumption of ham-rs2 was associated with improvements in their blood glucose and insulin sensitivity. This is significant because it reduces the amount of starch required to secrete insulin in patients at risk for developing Type 2 disease."
25053215,"This paper reviews the evidence for the efficacy of cash and incentive-based approaches to reducing smoking and other unhealthy behavior. It concludes that increased walking attendance does not result in improved energy expenditure or weight loss, but post-hoc analysis suggests that exercise is needed for long term weight loss. The level of exercise required for successful longterm weight loss also differs from that recommended in physical treatment programs. Conclusions In one study of employees at one large company who received an incentive to quit smoking significantly increased the rate of smoking cesation. This paper will provide policy relevant recommendations for using financial incentives and penalty as a means of encouraging healthy behavior."
27452342,"In this paper, we present the results of a three-year observational study on direct and indirect composite restorations for posterior teeth. We conclude that there is no significant difference in the success rate between these two treatment strategies."
27218592,"This paper focuses on the use of probiotics in women's care to prevent and treat urethropathies. It shows that vaginal Lactobacili can be used as a curative treatment for recurring uti, but it also has some drawbacks: there is no difference in the severity of symptoms between the two groups at day 1, and both groups have significant differences in the duration of their treatment."
30514444,"In this paper, the aim of this study is to systematically compare the performance of three different types of pulp-capping materials: Ca-OH, MTA, and Biodedentine. The results indicate that these three are suitable for human capping; however, further studies need to be performed in order to determine the appropriateness of each material."
28003033,"Conclusions In older adults who have been in the hospital for a long time, physical performance seems to be an important predictor of their mortality. Poor physical performance is also associated with worse outcomes than does poor mental health. A structured physical activity program improves the short-post-survival battery by reducing major mobility disability among elderly French women."
29740667,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to preventing hip fracture in older women by adjusting their diet and lifestyle. They conclude that higher dietary sources of animal and vegetable protein are associated with reduced bone loss and increased risk for hip fracture. However, they do not find any association between these two types of food. Women who eat more than nine cups of coffee also have an elevated risk of fracture; however, there is no association between consumption of red meat or other high-protein foods during this earlier age of life. Consuming dairy products increases serum Igf-I levels but does not lead to significant changes in total and hip bone loss. The results suggest that increasing plant-based and fruit-vegetarian diets may prevent hip fracture from older women. A reduction in animal-to-vegeratiate diets reduces bone loss while decreasing vegetable-vegan diets increase bone turnover. These studies suggest that low-carbohydrate diets can improve bone health in older adults."
30099652,"This paper concludes that probiotics do not significantly reduce the severity of disease but improve the quality of the stool-microbial community. Probiotics can be used as a preventative measure against CKD and may even delay the onset of disease in some patients. However, it is necessary to conduct large-scale, long-term studies to determine whether these effects are significant or not"
32428841,"In this paper, we present the results of a double-blind, quackery-controlled random-effects study on the effects of an eight-week intermittent fasting regimen on body composition and weight loss. The primary aim of the study was to determine whether or not the regimen would be effective in preventing or reducing certain disease-related risk factors. It was found that the regimen did not lead to significant changes in blood lipids or body composition among subjects with a history of weight reduction. However, it did lead to improvements in several other important risk-factors, including age-related disease, heart disease, and glyceric resistance."
32059350,"In this paper, the authors present evidence for a strong association between alcohol and cannabis use. They conclude that it is possible that these two chemicals are involved in the risk of developing schizophrenia. Furthermore, they suggest that there may be a higher-order gene-environment and gene-gene interactions between these two groups. This supports the notion that cannabinols have beneficial effects on patients with a mental disorder."
29564527,"The results of this large, prospective randomized controlled trial demonstrate that cryoballon ablation is superior to radial fluoroscopies for treating patients suffering from atrial fibrillation. Both methods are safe and have a good safety record. Concluusions This paper discusses the science and history of randomized trials as they relate to the treatment of congestive atrial fibrilation. It concludes by stating that ""both the CB1 and the rf-cf ablation appear safe."""
26293406,"In this paper, the authors present a summary of their previous work on atrial pacemaking. They conclude that it is beneficial to treat patients with sick Sinus Syndrome with an atrium-based pacemaker rather than a ventricular-based one because after long term follow-up there is no significant difference in health-related measures between ""physiologic"" and ""ventricular-paceing."" There are also no significant differences in stroke volume or heart failure among patients treated with either type of pacing system. However, complications following pacemakers are relatively low and compare favorably with early ones. The only reason for treating patients with such a device is to predict whether they will develop pacemaker syndrome. A severe pacemaker disease occurs in nearly 20 percent of VVir-paced patients who improve with reproduction to the dual chamber mode. Ventricular Desynchronization induces a higher risk of hospitalization and acute fibrillation in Snd with normal baseline levels of QRSD. Conclusions Severe Pacemaker Syndrome developed in nearly twenty % of vavr-pedic patients and improved by reprogrammment to the duochamber mode. Although prediction of pace maker syndrome is difficult"

26888184,"The results of this large-scale, cross-sectional study suggest that patients with a moderate to high risk of stroke who receive anticoagulation have a lower risk of death and major bleeding than those with solitary or persistent ailment. Conclusions In the large-patient cohort of aspirin-treated AF patients, those with persisting AF had higher rates of stroke but were not more likely to die from heart failure or hypertension. Both regimens of warfarin were associated with lower rates of bloody events. Although heart failure is associated with thrombosis, rhythm controls are associated with reduced risk of aff progression. Apxaban was an attractive treatment for both types of musculosis in these patients."
25121789,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the use of ""re source persons"" to train primary care nurses to perform the Oral Cancer-Scaning test as accurately and efficiently as doctors. The results suggest that such a system can be used to reduce the risk of death from malignancies in low- and middle- income countries. Conclusions Within public primary care services in Goa, trained lay health workers were not only cost effective but also cost saving. There was no significant difference in weight for age or height for age between the two groups at 6 months. These differences are not significant at 12 months; they do not mean that there is any need for additional resources. Cost-effective approaches to oral cancer testing by visual inspection are to offer it directly to the highrisk population. At least 37,000oral cancer deaths worldwide have been prevented through this trial."
25323058,"This paper presents the results of a large, long-term, prospective observational study on elderly patients with high blood pressure. The primary end point was a reduction in strokes and major events in both age groups. In addition, there were significant differences in the proportion of patients who reached the target blood pressure of 140 mmHhg at three years' follow-up. Although this trial was not designed for final conclusion, it did suggest that strict control is superior to more stringent treatment. Furthermore, older patients with low blood pressure had a greater risk of heart attack than those with higher blood pressure levels. However, these results do not support the use of newer treatments such as calcium blockers or angiotin-converting inhibitors in treating hypertension."
31553733,"The purpose of this paper is to summarize the results of a large, well-planned, and well-responsed European study of atrial fillation. It was based on a pooled randomised control group of 2659 patients who were aged between 45 and 89 years. In terms of their risk for stroke, they showed that immediate or delayed intervention was more likely to result in new diagnoses than delayed intervention. After 4 months, there was an increase in the rate of new diagnosis among those with active ECG monitoring. There was also a greater frequency of anticoagulant use by those with high risk of thrombophilis. Furthermore, when compared with controls, these patients had a higher proportion of patients taking appropriate anticoagulants."
31944175,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft eloquently describes the results of a large, long-term observational study in which patients with acute atrial fistbursts were more likely to have a stroke than those without. This was followed by a detailed analysis of the effects of different types of bleeding events on health status and utility over time. These studies suggest that treatment with long term citicoline may be associated with better quality of life and improves mental status two years after an initial ischemic Stroke. The most significant finding of this study is that three-year follow-up by an implantable heart monitor showed a higher frequency of AF detection than routine care. Furthermore, these results suggest that warfarin or aspirin might be cost-effective alternatives for stroke prevention from the point of view of the U.S. National Health Service. Conclusions and Reneval Af is independent associated with an increase in risk of incident mammion due to its association with high risk of stroke; in addition, it is known that there is a growing concern of seriousness of the disease as a ""public health burden."" Therefore, anticoagulation should be introduced as"
23697478,"In this paper, the authors present an evidence-based approach to improving blood pressure control in patients with ""uncontrolled hypertension."" They conclude that pharmacists and physician-patients can work together to improve blood pressure. A pharmacist-led lipid management intervention reduces the risk of heart attack by reducing total cholesterol and leptodensis while improving patient satisfaction. This study also supports the idea that physicians may be more effective when they include pharmacists as part of their primary care team. The results of this study suggest that community pharmacists may have a significant role in improving quality of life for patients with Type 2 diabetes."
29765895,"Conclusions The results of this study suggest that bovine teeth can be used as substitutes for dentin and enamel bonding. Although porcine teeth do not provide the same strength as human teeth, they do have different morphologies. Conscious of restorative effects, the use of only one % Naocl alone results in higher bonding than other treatments. Collagen removal does not improve the bonding between self-etched adhesives and caries removed dentine. However, there is a significant increase in the strength of both systems when compared to the results obtained with conventional methods."
25609995,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of preoperative pain scores to predict post-surgery pain in patients with severe and persistent pain. He concludes that these scores can be used as predictors of future pain severity for patients who are at high risk for persistent pain after surgery. This may lead to improved patient satisfaction and reduced costs. A recent study suggests that using pain-catastrophization as a predictor of long-term chronic pain following total kneearthroplasty has some merit."
28868822,"Conclusions Decaffiened Gte did not increase body weight, BMI, or wc. However, the high activity form of the carbohydrate-rich glycogen showed some beneficial effects on fasting blood concentrations in women with Type 2 diabetes. In addition, there was no significant change in lesion size between the two groups. Acute ingestion of green tea extract improved glucose tolerance in mice at risk for Type 2 disease. The effect of metformin and lifestyle changes were more effective than either treatment. Furthermore, green tea had an anti-disease effect because it stimulates the release of glutathione into the circulation."
28506257,"In this paper, we describe the results of a meta-analysis of 100 systematic reviews that have been published between 1995 and 2005. Although new evidence is rapidly emerging in these studies, it is not yet clear how quickly they will become available for new evidence. We use a method similar to that used by other authors to determine whether changes in evidence are sufficient to warrant updates. For example, if a new trial does not increase the risk of treatment being associated with a major change in outcome, then the previous study did not need to be updated. These signals include changes in the magnitude or relative effect of an intervention. They also include significant changes in efficacy as well as minor changes in effects. Finally, we conclude that homeopathy is superior to placebo in relieving pain and improving quality of life among persons with fms."
22796243,"Back pain is a common cause of both leg and back pain, but it is not yet clear whether this is due to an overly acute injury or a long-term condition. This paper discusses the relationship between posture and function in patients with low back pain. Postural control seems to be compromised in these patients because they are preoccupied with postural stability."
24166727,"Conclusions Soy allergy is not common in children with Cma-associated IgE. However, soy may be a good alternative for some patients because it reduces their risk of severe asthma attacks and improves their control over the course of treatment. In contrast, feeding an ethic or a high-fat diet results in significant improvements in infants who have cow's milk sensitive intolerance due to the presence of dairy in their diet"
31583250,"In this paper, the effects of a probiotic on blood pressure and weight gain in pregnant women with gestational dialysis are examined. The results show that there is no effect of the probiotics on FPG, insulin resistance, or other pregnancy outcome. However, it is concluded that these effects need to be confirmed before any new treatments can be approved. Women with GDM have greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes due to their increased glycemia."
28166606,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to treating patients with acute coronary thrombosis by comparing the efficacy and safety of two different approaches: simva statin alone or combination of both agents. The results suggest that either treatment may be more effective than monotherapy in terms of preventing atheroscomatose disease. Furthermore, it is suggested that the combined treatment might be more advantageous for patients with high risk of cardiovascular disease."
23179416,"In this chapter, we discuss the results of a large-scale study in which adults with ADHD lose substantial amounts of their workforce productivity. We conclude that there are two main reasons for this: first, people with ADHD tend to have lower income than others; and second, boys who respond to either treatment also respond to the other one. Both treatments produce significant changes in behavior and performance in young children with both types of disorder. For example, once daily doses of Medtronic or Con produce statistically different effects on test scores among children with an early-onset disorder. This suggests that long-term use of stimulants may not be necessary for children with late-onset symptoms. However, it is important to note that some patients do not experience any additional benefit from longer-acting medication. Children with mixed-type ADHD show significant impairment in later life. The authors present a new approach to treating children with ADHD by using a modified Learning Stimulator as a measure of how well the drug works. It is clear that adding a higher dose of adderall does not lead to greater gains in learning and academic performance."
12917993,"In this paper, we describe the effect of a combination of hGH and ox on patients with Turner's disease. The results suggest that a high-frequency regimen can be more effective in terms of increase in height and speed than a lower frequency regimen. However, it is not advantageous for girls with longer bone age to receive higher doses of gh because they do not respond well to long-term treatment. We also conclude that if young girls start GH at a very late age, their final height may be as high as 150cm"
24529402,"This paper focuses on the perceptions of patients and their health care staff regarding the potential for disruption of services to identity and technology. It concludes by describing a large scale randomized controlled trial that evaluates the effects of an telecare system on health outcomes in patients with chronic orphaned pulmonary disease, particularly those with severe convalescent periods. The results suggest that this system can be used to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations for patients with moderate-to-severe chest disease."
24618584,"The results of this study suggest that financial incentives may be an effective and cost-effective strategy for reducing smoking among workers at a large company. In addition, it suggests that worksite health promotion programs can be more cost effective than other forms of public health intervention."
25329390,"Children and Adolescents with Arthritis: A Meta-Aecdote In this paper, we summarize the results of our previous studies on children with JRA. We conclude that children can improve their health by participating in weight bearing physical conditioning exercises without pain or disease exaggeration. This is a good strategy for improving health in children with joints that involve severe hip involvement."
27460566,"In this paper, Conclusions focuses on the use of long metal screw posts as a replacement for conventional crowns in patients with severely deformed teeth. He concludes that these posts are superior to traditional crowns because they do not require excessive post space and can be used as an aid to heal damaged teeth."
31844350,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of a large, well-respected study on the efficacy of non-operative treatment for acute appendicetis. We conclude that it is feasible and cost-effective to treat children with acute appenicitis without requiring an appendectomy. A randomized, single-blind, ad-primary follow-up is required to determine whether or not initial treatment with antibiotics is safe and effective."
24321502,"Conclusions In this paper, we present the results of a two-month follow-up study of patients with metastasis androgen incompetently treated prostatecancer. We find that a shorter treatment interval after rebrt plus six months of chemopherination is associated with lower risk of mortality in men with unfavoable risk. Furthermore, our results emphasize the ""heterogeneity of biological behavior"" of these patients. After salvage resection, there is no significant improvement in overall survival. Satrapicillin delays progression of disease but does not increase the time for disease progression. Salve cryotherapy improves local tumor control; however, it causes considerable morbidity as well. The use of salvage cryo therapy has been shown to be more effective than single cycle prostatectomy. Adects within two years of Biochemical Recurrence were associated with an increase in Prostate-Specific Survival among men who had a Prostatic Antigen doubling Time of less than six months. This should be a useful end point for further studies on whether or not early Adcept can reduce the risk of metastases. Early Ad"
30185438,"In this paper, Conclusions outlines the evidence for the efficacy of long-term moderate-intensity steroid regimens in preventing atrial fillation after ablation. He concludes that it is not effective to prevent late-stage atrial Fibrillation and suggests that use of small doses of corticostogenes shortly after aflation may be more effective than immediate treatment. However, there is a significant increase in the risk of recurring musculosis after AFF therapy."
30306544,"In this paper, we describe the results of a single-blind, random-controlled trial in which tatandalafil was found to be more effective than placebo in treating benign prostatichyperplasia in patients with a mean age of 35.5 years. We conclude that each drug can improve the symptoms of men with BPH better than either combination therapy. The most common bothersome symptom is Urinary Urination, but both men and women report mild or major bothersome symptoms. Naftoppidil seems to have the best efficacy in treating these conditions."
30953308,"This paper focuses on the relationship between muscular strength and body fatness in childhood and adulthood. It concludes that young men with low muscular strength are at greater risk of developing chronic disease later in life than those with higher muscular strength. The results suggest that early physical activity may be useful for preventing long-term health problems from occurring. Athletic participation is also associated with improved bone mass in young girls, but this does not predict future pain."
31720713,"This paper focuses on the effects of physical exercise on bone loss after stroke. It concludes that better motor control, walking recovery, and reduced bone loss are associated with improved bone mineral homeostacity in patients who have had a stroke. In addition, this study suggests that use of hypnotics may be beneficial for treating post-stroke patients because it can help to prevent future fractures."
28578534,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the use of hypnotism to reduce pain and anxiety in children with acutely ill-timed leukemia. Hypnosis is shown to be particularly effective in reducing pain when used during a puncture wound."
16867188,"Conclusions In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective, feb-controlled, random-effects study in which patients with mild-to-moderate nausea were treated for their major depression. This was followed by a more favorable treatment of pramipex Olepraxole at a dose of 1.0mg per day. Although side effects were rare, most patients experienced nausea and other side effects. The efficaciousness of both drugs was demonstrated in this single-blind, placebo-control study. There were also no significant differences between the two groups in terms of pain severity or adverse events. However, there were no significant difference in safety or tolerability among the three groups. These results suggest that bupropion Sr and fluoxetine may be appropriate initial choices for treating major depressive disease."
21838650,Holmbeck and colleagues present a set of evidence-based assessment measures that have been evaluated in a series of peer-reviewed papers. Most of the measures lack sufficient supporting information to make an informed decision about whether they are reliable or not. They conclude that there are some flaws in the methods used to develop these measures but that most of them are well-established. A checklist is then developed for use by authors as they begin to develop their measures.
25913420,This paper focuses on the use of the Ipa-Question to assess activity in people with Type 2 and suggests that it may be useful to use this information to predict whether or not treatment of type 2 will be effective.
29457570,"Prebiotics in infant formulas may improve gut health. In this study, we examine the effects of a pre-biotic mixture of PDx and GOS on growth and stool quality in infants. We conclude that feeding infants with these prebiotics can reduce the frequency of fever outbreaks when compared to breast-fed children. Our results suggest that adding such a good-for-nothing solution to an infant's diet will not cause any adverse side effects."
22008401,"Conclusions There are no significant differences in the spherometry and oxygen saturation of patients underwent deep breathing exercises after chest artery bypassing. The three post-operative regimens were equivalent to the recovery of fivv on the first 5 days. Intrapulsive ventilation during the post-cathesis stay promotes faster recovery of postoperative lung functions in the obese. Postoperative physical therapy is not as effective as preoperative intervention alone in preventing PPC. Both groups experience a drop in their ic, with a volume of 1457  617.87cc; t testP .001, and 1557 89  801 cc. These preliminary results confirm that preoperative uses of the is do not lead to substantial improvements of inspiratoury capacity and therefore it is unable to prevent postopérantal decline in lung function."" Concluusions Thoracusal bone infacultation is common in sickle cell disease where the patient is hospitalized with sudden chest pain. In addition, incentives can prevent pulmonary complications caused by acute chest pain or back pain from occurring after surgery for these patients. Pulmon"
30320723,"In this paper, Conclusions demonstrates that the use of an anatomic approach to ablation can prevent atrial fistia in up to 80 percent of patients. Confusingly, however, the results suggest that cryoballon and rfc are more effective than conventional methods for curing paroxysmal atrial fibrilation. The success rate of both methods is similar, with CB-ablation accounting for greater freedom from arrhythmics at one year's follow-up as compared to RF-cure. Acute perforations remain common even when the patient has a long history of conduction block. Both methods lead to safe and rapid ablation without significant risk of complications."
30397494,"The results of this study indicate that exercise is safe for Type 1 patients with mild to moderate Type 1 diabetes. Although there are some drawbacks, such as the need for time elapse from last dose of insulin, these are all addressed in this paper."
32242450,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a febbering meta-review of the effects of fluoxetine on patients with major depressive or OCD. We conclude that it is safe and effective for children and adults with OCD, although there are some drawbacks. Conclusions: This study does not provide any evidence to support use of hypnelzime in OCD; however, it does provide some additional benefit by adding buspirone for up to six weeks. Consciousness: Although these results suggest that paroxetine may have some efficacy as a short-term therapy for some patients with Ocrasive-Compulsive disorder, they do not warrant further investigation."
27820540,"The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a survey of stroke patients in the community. It was found that knowledge of risk factors, warning signs, and treatment was sufficient to increase the speed of medical care for those with a stroke. A walk program was also effective in improving physical function after stroke. In addition, exercise was associated with improved health status and quality of life among stroke patients. This paper concludes by describing a single blinded randomised control trial of health promotion and counseling for patients with acute or chronic stroke. It showed that exercise training could improve upper extremity function in people with chronic stroke but did not lead to improvements in physical function."
24256847,"This paper focuses on elderly lung patients' decision-making about treatment. It presents the results of a large, prospective, and cross-sectional study of older adults with advanced gastric or mixed-tongued lung disease. The primary aim of this study was to determine the influence of old age on the outcome of treatment in these patients. Conclusions ADL score as predictors of toxicity were also useful in predicting the risk of drug relapse. Inpatient garosectal assessment was furthermore validated as an important tool for stratifying patient risk in older adult patients with a malignant disease."
27820577,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a large randomized trial using telemedicine to improve heart failure care for patients with mild-to-mid-stage heart failure. Although there is no significant difference in mortality between the two groups, the Alere Net system does have a significant reduction in readmissions and costs when compared to other approaches. This study also shows that a ""hybrid"" or ""C+HBI"" program of care can be used to reduce hospitalizations in patients with high-risk heart failure who aren't homebound. The results show that it's more cost effective to use telephoning than to use traditional medical care."
29478018,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed description of the different dietary patterns that have been shown to be associated with improved health in the Mediterranean region. They conclude by stating that the Mediterranean diet appears to be more beneficial than the traditional American diet for reducing mortality. The results support the importance of a Mediterranean-based approach to preventing and reversing the course of disease."
25939649,"Digoxin does not reduce the overall mortality of patients with heart failure, but it reduces the rate of admission to the hospital. In a sub-adjuvenile group of patients who have been treated with digoxin, however, there is no evidence of an increased risk for death in those who receive it. A recent meta-analysis suggests that this may be due to the fact that different patients have different characteristics and that certain drugs may lead to worse outcomes."
28560516,"This paper focuses on the safety and efficacy of endobarbus ablation in sick atrial fist patients. It also discusses the potential for long-term benefit of this form of treatment, particularly in patients with severe aortic thrombosis."
20626853,"In this study, Wuthering Heights et al. concludes that the ""placeboxed"" treatment is as efficacious as the active one, but there is no evidence for its efficacy in patients with relapsed pain."
14974070,"In this paper, we examine the effects of long-term daily calcium and trace mineral supplementation on bone loss in women with early menopaausal. We find that there is no significant difference in bone loss between the two groups, but only a slight difference in the amount of trace mineral taken from the placebo group. This suggests that longer-term calcium intervention may be more effective than estrogen therapy for preventing early bone loss."
29037523,"This paper presents the results of a literature search and concludes that the PSI is reliable, valid, and responsive. It also supports the efficacy of the Wi-Nurse as an outcome measure for patients with mild to severe plaque disease. Furthermore, it can be used as a stand-alone measure of patient productivity in adult-onset rheumatologies."
19370677,This paper discusses the efficacy of cannabbinol in treating patients with mild to moderate forms of dementia. It demonstrates that it can be used as a stand-alone or in combination with other antipsychotics for treatment of both acute and chronic forms of the disease.
25668264,"Losartan is even more effective than ACE inhibitor in preventing major cardiovascular events, particularly in patients with Type 2 diabetes. In addition, it reduces the risk of stroke and death from all causes. Furthermore, it has a higher blood pressure-reducing effect than that of other antihubertensive treatments. These results emphasize the need for further studies to determine the efficacy of these newer drugs."
27836071,"Neck pain is the most common cause of work-related pain, and there are no effective treatment strategies for relieving neck pain in this population. Several studies have examined the efficacy of manual therapy, physical therapy, and exercise in treating neck pain. Although these treatments have not been well studied, they do show some promising results in terms of pain reduction, quality of life, and patient satisfaction."
27071989,"ImPACT, the most commonly used post injury assessment tool, is a good starting point for further research. It has a high sensitivity and specificity in the literature, but it does not meet all of the necessary requirements for clinical use. Concussion patients are more likely to experience long-term neurocognition and memory problems than those who report distant concussessions."
25452221,"This paper focuses on the use of enteral feeding as a preventative measure against necrotising infected infants who are very preterm. It concludes that early enteral feeds are associated with reduced risks of necrophilis but do not lead to significant changes in the risk for necrotizing enterocotlitis in VLBw infants. However, it is necessary to confirm this finding in large randomized controlled trials."
27483307,"Conclusions This paper refutes the notion that healthy, metabolically active subjects are diseased because they show increased risk of a number of serious events."
27842225,"This paper discusses the efficacy of a nurse-led education program for patients who have had a heart attack. The results suggest that this intervention may be more cost effective than other forms of patient education. However, it does not result in improved pain management outcomes or improved quality of life at three months post-discharge. Conclusions In addition, there are no significant effects on use of medical resources. Nurse-led care was shown to improve self-care behavior and reduce readmissions from 3 months after hospital discharge. Routine follow-up by a physician is recommended as an additional measure of improvement in these patients. A six week cardial rehabilitation program is found to be beneficial in improving physical health, mental health, and anxiety. These benefits remain at 12 months; however, elevated levels of depression appear to be associated with impairedquality of life."
22889860,"This study focuses on the use of the fatigue scale in children and young adults with adolescent and child-behavior-based treatment of patients with recurrent or life-threatening childhood cancer. It is shown that corticosterroid use, haemogen value, and haemologlobin values are associated with increased fatigue in children receiving concurrent steroid therapy. The severity of the patient's symptoms vary from patient to parent; however, the type of drug used does not seem to be strongly associated with fatigue. In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, i.e., prospective, observational study of fatigue among children and adolescents who have been treated for their disease."
29627967,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effect of walking exercise on patients with intermittent paddling. He concludes that it is possible to improve walking performance in patients who do not suffer from intermittent clacudication by using supervised walking exercises. A group-meditative behavior intervention can be used to prevent mobility loss and improve function at 6- and 12 month follow-up for patients with persistent claudiciousness. This study also suggests that a homebased walking program can improve walking endurance in patients with moderately claciatic bowel disease. The results are similar to those seen in other studies. Conclusions Home-based walking does not improve walking speed or quality of life; however, it improves walking speed andquality of life in persons with diabetes and pad."
19821358,"The narrator discusses some of the latest scientific developments in the field of virgin disease. In this paper, we present two recent studies that show promising new approaches to treating BV. First, we report that Lactobacili strains can be used as an effective and cost-effective treatment for BV in African women. Second, we demonstrate that douching is associated with increased risk of BV infection. Finally, we conclude that probiotics are superior to conventional anti-historous treatments in relieving BV by improving vaginal health."
30273409,"In this study, Wuthering Heights et al concludes that there is little evidence for the efficacy of physical exercise in treating moderate to mild depression. A hatha-based form of meditation appears to be more effective than usual care for depressed patients. The results suggest that an eight-week program of yoga can be used as a treatment for mild to moderate major depression. Both groups show significant improvements in symptoms over the course of the first 12 weeks. Women assigned to the group showed greater improvements on measures of mood and quality of life, including pain, fatigue, and mood. These findings support the potential use of a full-spectrum intervention for women with OCD."
29185808,"Curcumins are safe and well tolerated in a large-scale, long-term study of patients with atherogenic hyperlipidemia. This is the first evidence of their efficacy in treating patients with a severe form of atherogenemia. In addition, it has some anti-inflammatory effects that may be beneficial for patients with Type 2 diabetes."
31284372,"In this paper, the authors describe a short-term exercise program for patients with lung disease who are not suitable for surgery. They conclude that it is possible to improve physical health in patients with advanced or metastatic lung disease by using a combination of pre- and post-opportunity exercise regimens. Although these regimens do not lead to significant changes in patient performance, they have some promising applications. For example, ProLUCA suggests that long-term home-based exercise training may be an effective treatment for anxiety and depression among lung cancer patients."
25572192,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft discusses the benefits and drawbacks of IV iron as a treatment for post-transplantal anemia. He concludes that it is safe and efficacious to use IV iron in patients with severe heart failure who are not receiving blood transfusion during their pre-conception period. Conclusive evidence suggests that IV iron may be more effective than either IV or oral iron in treating anemia caused by menorrhaagia. Intravenous iron sucrose improves fatigue in iron deficient, women with good safety and tolerateability profile. This study does not demonstrate any significant association between IV iron administration and risk of bacterialemia in Dialysis patients; however, there could be a slight increased risk of infection in patients given excessively high dose IV iron."
25428524,"Conclusions The results of this study suggest that a low-dose tetrasteal solution can be used as a new modality to treat hypogonadasm in older men. In addition, it appears that concomitants with F with t may attenuating the impact of t therapy on PSA and other prostate-regarding complications. This conclusion has important implications for the prevention or treatment of Ostoporoseis in older males with low test levels. Conscious changes in fat free mass are not observed in men who receive only T replacement levels. Furthermore, there is no significant change in body composition after T replaces DHT. Men with high blood concentrations do not show any improvement in their physical function when treated with either placebo or TTT. However, these results suggest that ""physiological and near-physical increases of testosterone will increase muscleprotein anabolism"" and that ""muscle strength and quality of life"" should be taken into account."
30464474,"This paper concludes that a combination of theta-beta treatment and neurofeedback is superior to single-drug treatment in treating children with ADHD, although some critics have questioned its efficacy. In particular, they suggest that this form of treatment may be more appropriate for those who are not yet on the verge of switching from one medication to another."
24304677,"In this paper, Conclusions demonstrates that infants fed a probiotic or a synbiotic formula gain weight more quickly than those fed control formulas. He concludes that the rate of weight gain is similar to that of children who were not given a control diet. However, there are some drawbacks in the trial design and reporting. For example, it was found that feeding Lactobacterus F19 at weaning reduced the risk of early onset of allergy by 2 years but did not increase the severity of disease by any other means. This conclusion supports the use of Lactobilli as a preventive measure against childhood apprehension."
30364046,"Conclusions A randomized, open-label trial evaluating the efficacy of an eight-week exercise program for patients with moderate to severe fibromyais. The results suggest that this form of treatment is cost effective and can be used as a stand-alone intervention in women with mild to moderate pain."
31039960,"Conclusions Lisuride-maleate appears to be a promising new treatment for the symptoms of postmenstrual breast pain. Although there are some side effects, this study suggests that it may be more effective than other forms of treatment. In addition, it has been reported that topical isolavone can be used as a second-line treatment for patients with cyclical or non-cyclic mastals. The efficacy of soy-protein in treating breast pain seems to be limited."
29163833,"In patients with overactive bladder who are not adequately managed by an anti-cholinergic, OnaboulinumtixinA 100 U significantly reduces the severity of their symptoms and improves quality of life. Moreover, it has been shown that repeated treatments provide significant and similar safety and efficacy to single-dose therapy. Conclusions This study provides class I evidence that uponabotuliniumtoxina can improve all over active bladder symptoms in patients poorly managed by antichollinergics; however, there is some risk of self catheteration."
17054170,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to treating patients with an acute or chronic fissure using a combination of surgical and non-surgical approaches. They conclude that both treatments are effective in relieving pain and improving the patient's health. The first treatment is a local application of topical gastrofluoxem over a period of two weeks. The second treatment is more expensive and has less side effects than the first. This suggests that it may be better to wait until after the initial healing stage before proceeding with any other treatment. A further study is performed to determine whether topical vaginal opium can be used as a curative treatment for patients who have a chronic condition. It was found that topical gabrillafin had a greater reduction in pain and swelling than did topical morphine. However, there were no significant differences between group 1 and group 2 in terms of their efficacy."
26793356,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effects of different antihystertensive drugs on blood pressure, lipids, and stiffness in elderly patients. They conclude that ARBs may be more effective at reducing the risk of heart attack than thief's prescription."
26358358,"The results of this study suggest that a low-sugar diet can be used as an intervention to reduce atheroscy in patients with nafld disease. In addition, it is suggested that consumption of high-florose foods may be advantageous for people with heart disease because they are more likely to be able to tolerate higher levels of fat and lipids than the control group."
18197978,"Conclusions There is little evidence for a long-term, patient-centered approach to treatment for children with ADHD. For example, a two-year study found that morphine was as effective as placebo in treating symptoms of the disorder. However, this does not bode well for patients who have other underlying causes of their disorder. In contrast, Oros-Mh, an over-the-counter anti-disorder drug, appears to be even more effective than standard treatment for both relapsed and unrepairable symptoms."
28492950,"In this paper, Dr. Rivers systematically reviews the evidence for the efficacy of high-tetrahc/low-cbd drugs in humans. He concludes that although there are some drawbacks to the use of these two drugs, it is possible that they may lead to increased risks for human health."
29684790,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to predicting back pain in people with and without lumbar discrepancy. They use a case-control study to examine changes in hip and spine kinetics during walking. The results suggest that there may be some kind of compensatory mechanism for low back pain."
29760482,"In this chapter, the authors present a detailed description of the effects of sweeteners on blood glucose control. They conclude that there are no side-effects to either the nature of or expectancy of the other measures; however, they do suggest that some contribute of expectancy in the positive effect of sugar on cognition. The results indicate that acute hyperglucoemia does not alter plasma fibrinogenolysis in older subjects. Consuming a high amount of milk increases total mealtime energy intake but lowers blood glucose and Insulin concentration. Conclusions In humans, artificial sweetners increase GLP1 secretion by eliciting an increase in glutophosphorylation. This may be due to the increased length of stomach to nutrients. Acute administration of dxylose reduces postpran and iary glycaemia while improving the effect of DPP-4 inhibiting type 2 diabetes. These conclusions support the idea that LCS consumption can improve memory performance even when it is only applied to the mouth."
31266163,"In this paper, we describe the results of a four-year observational study on the performance of two different types of cement inlays. The first is RXU, which seems to perform better than the second at three years; however, it does not appear to improve the patient's long-term survival. Conclusions that the use of simpler, less abrasive, self-etching cements can lead to better results for both groups. Finally, we examine the effect of selective enamel etcheding on the bond strength of composite cements used for indirect restorations."
19910803,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of balance training as an injury preventive measure in high school girls. He concludes that balance training can reduce ankle and knee injuries by preventing them from occurring. Athletic trainers need to be better educated about injury prevention strategies so that they can make informed decisions about how to best train their players."
27590729,A brisk diet with a high-quality probiotic was found to improve blood glucose levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes. This suggests that probiotics might be an effective treatment for type 2 disease.
29439755,"In this paper, Conclusions discusses the use of telemedicine to help physicians identify patients at higher risk of developing congenital heart disease. Although there is some evidence that this intervention can improve blood pressure control, it does not appear to have any significant effect on improving patient adherence to preventive measures. Acute-cradle pain is a particularly poor problem in primary care because doctors do not have adequate technology to manage these patients."
31763928,This paper concludes that a Mediterranean-based diet can improve blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart attack in people with a high-risk background.
29350873,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights discusses the use of a novel pain-sensitivity test to predict the efficacy of morphine in treating patients with knee pain. The results suggest that it may be useful for physicians to use this test as a predictor of pain after surgery. However, there are some drawbacks: the test is poorly standardized and does not accurately predict pain at post-opportune intervals. Furthermore, subjects with painful leg pain exhibit greater decrements in performance when using motor imagery. Finally, the study concludes that ""pain pressure thresholdalgometry"" can be used to track pain progress in musculoskeletal pain."
25631639,"In this paper, Conclusions and Roussoon present the results of a large-scale, long-term observational study on children with asthma. They conclude that there is little evidence for a relationship between levels of vitamin D in children and asthma."
22142898,"The results of this study suggest that iron deficiency can be attributed to lack of iron, but there are no significant differences in birth histories, socioeconomic status, or general nutrition. Iron-deficient infants treated with iron improved their learning and memory performance when compared to children who were not anemic. This is supported by the use of trifling doses of iron and zinc as treatment options. In contrast, short-term iron treatment does not improve school performance. However, it does improve pre-and posttreatment psychological tests."
26558494,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft demonstrates that light therapy can be used as an effective treatment for the treatment of winter affective disorder in patients with a family history of depression. It is concluded that there are site differences in severity of depression when treated with bright white light, but that diagnose and medication status do not affect response. This suggests that light may have an antidepressive effect by a ""nonspecific effect"" or that it has biologically active action in the treatmentof SAD across different intensities. A significant relapse occurs after withdrawal of the dim-visor. These conclusions suggest that light might act as a kind of placebo or that its efficacy over wide ranges of intensities could be explained by the fact that the light does not interfere with the patient's normal sleep pattern."
25643669,This study focuses on the effects of aqueous-diluted 25-hydroxyvitamin D on growth and bone turnover in patients with asthma. The results suggest that a high-dose of this particular form of vitamin D may be advantageous for children with asthma because it reduces the risk of developing an allergic disease later in life.
25807223,"Conclusions In patients with persistent atrial fibrillation to DCC, no evidence of a second LV dysfunction exists. PVI significantly improves LV function in these patients. However, the current single-arm study is too small to verify the efficacy of ablation for this patient group. The authors present a detailed review of the latest developments in the field of AF and suggest that it may be possible to use a combination of repeat surgery and drug therapy to treat patients with feigned ailment."
24474283,"The results of the first three-year follow-up periodontal trial are presented. There is a significant improvement in attachment after Emodain application, but there is no evidence that this effect is due to any adverse effects. Conclusions: Both treatments result in better results in terms of reduction of cal gain and reduction of papillary defects. Conclisions furthermore suggest that Emdogahin may be an effective treatment for deep and wide fistbite defects."
29770953,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the potential of using web-based approaches to promote physical activity among older Nova Scotian men with breast, chest, and prostatecancer. Although there is little evidence that these approaches can be effective in reducing both patient and carer burdens, it is clear that they do have some drawbacks. For example, patients who are not meeting the recommended levels of physical activity at the time of the intervention may experience greater fatigue than those who meet the recommended values. This paper also discusses the use of ""human-machine interactions"" as a means for engaging middle-aged men in exercise behavior change trials. It concludes that although many studies have looked into how such experiences relate to engagement among males, no one has yet investigated whether or not these experiences might impact engagement among younger men."
30712238,"Concluson Biooss reduces the risk of mucousal recession by avoiding an immediate placement of the implant. The results suggest that advantageous implant success rates, periimplant tissue responds, and long-term prospective studies are needed. However, this study does not involve a randomized controlled trial; it is therefore necessary to conduct further studies to confirm the efficacy of this procedure."
24369149,"In this paper, we summarize the results of our previous studies on rogen replacement therapy in type 2diabetes. Our main conclusion is that changes in concentrations of testosterone are associated with changes in fat free mass, muscle size, strength, power, fat mass, and Igf-I levels. We also conclude that different androgen-deficiency processes have different testosterone dose-responsive relationships. For example, men with Type 2 diabetes benefit from long-term steroid treatment because it improves their body composition and reduces their risk of heart attack. However, short-term orrogen Deprivation treatments do not affect serum lipid or hemoglobinA1c independent of Statin therapy."
30215045,"In this paper, Wulliver argues that the use of antimicrobials during elective surgery is not justified because it does not increase the risk of infectious complications. The results of a recent meta-analysis suggest that using prophylactic anecdote to prevent postoperating wounds in patients who have no risk factors for infection are not sufficient to prevent these complications from occurring. This study concludes that there is no benefit in treating laparoscopic men with prophylaxes as they do not seem to reduce the severity of surgical wounds."
24076079,"In this paper, we examine the efficacy of a walk-based program in improving walking performance in people with Type 1 and Type 2 musculosity. We conclude that home-based exercises are more effective than supervised or unsupervised exercise regimens for improving walking ability in patients with Type 1, especially those with moderate to severe claudicular disease. This paper also discusses the use of group-medicated behavior as an intervention for improved walking performance among patients with type 1, particularly paternal artery disease."

30104184,"This paper focuses on the potential of using wearable devices to track changes in patients' mood and behavior over time. It uses a case-control study to examine the association between self-reported bipolar symptoms and frequency of use of hand-held devices during follow-up. The results suggest that there may be promise in using these newer, more sensitive approaches to tracking mental health in young adults."
18554425,"Conclusions Iron-fortification reduces the risk of anemia in children with and without infection by reducing Fe concentrations. Three months later, infants with parents in the iron treatment group were significantly higher than those with mothers who did not have mothers in the control group. Consumption of iron-rich fish sauce reduced the frequency of iron deficiencies in women in Ho Chi Minh city during the six-month intervention. Fortified fish sauce was more effective in reducing iron stores than soy sauce."
19885644,"In this paper, we present a systematic review of the efficacy of a two-session workstation exercise program to reduce upper-limb pain among call center workers. The results show that use of an ergonomically designed task chair can lead to significant reductions in pain and symptoms as well as improvements in other health and safety measures. This study concludes that a ""personal preventive"" intervention can be more effective than conventional methods in relieving upper-body pain associated with work performed by call center employees."
26381811,"In this chapter, we present the results of a double-blind, feigning placebo-controlled study in which subjects were given 100 milligrams ofmodafinil as a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and then compared it to a placebo. We conclude that there is no significant effect on long term memory or executive function compared with those given by placebo. However, these results do not seem to be statistically significant. Furthermore, they suggest that Modafinill may improve performance in patients with mild-to-meditated attention deficion. The authors also note that although some studies have suggested that moderate doses of drug might be more effective than other forms of antipsychotics, such as morphine, there has never been sufficient evidence to support this claim."
20351229,"The results of this study suggest that there is no risk of adverse outcome from amputation in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. However, the long term survival of these patients is significantly inferior to that of nondisabetics who do not have preexisting disease. Postoperative complications were found to be more likely in those with peripheral and/or insulin-dependent type of disease. In addition, postoperative mortality was much higher in patients treated with venous disease."
24708875,"This paper discusses the relationship between birth weight and brain development at different ages. For example, women who use methadone during their pregnancy have a higher risk of having a stroke than women who don't use it. In addition, smoking is a risk factor for poorer mental health in children born of drug misusing mothers."
31948489,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the association between patient-related characteristics and risk of unadherence to treatment for depression. It concludes by recommending that patients with these characteristics should be given special attention in order to improve their adherence. Consequences In this paper, we discuss the importance of family involvement in determining whether or not patients are able to adhere to treatment. We conclude by stating that it is important to keep an eye out for patients who do not seem to be taking adequate doses of antidepressants."
29474541,"This paper discusses the advantages and drawbacks of three different methods for debonding an in-vivo enamel surface. The first method uses a self-adhesion material called ""Maxcem Elite"" to increase bond strength, while the second uses an electric current that causes the bonding force to be very strong."
29988399,"Conclusions The results of this study do not support the use of trivalproex as a treatment for bipolar I in youths, although it does have some negative effects. In particular, there is a large placebo response and subject-hogeneity. However, conclusive conclusions are needed regarding the safety and efficacy to be gained from these studies. For example, one small sample of pre-dawn patients with bipolar disorder showed that divalpropex did not significantly improve their symptoms when compared to placebo; however, the overall adverse events were similar to those reported for epilepsy. This suggests that younger children may be more sensitive to both of these drugs than older children. Clonidine was found to be safer and cheaper than Lily as maintenance treatment among youths who stabled on combinationLi+/Dvvx pharmacotherapies. Concliusions A preliminary study confirms open label findings showing that Divalproix is an efficiacious treatment for ""explosive temper and moodlability in disrupting children and adolescents."" Concluuseions An earlier study suggests that lamotrigin may be effective as an add-on treatment for Bipolar II"
30135848,"Conclusions In this chapter, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of different types of bonding agents for treating dentin. For example, conventional cements can be improved by etching and rinsing to achieve better results in early-cynical situations. However, there is some concern that these methods may compromise the quality of the final product"
21898039,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of our previous studies on desmopressedin for noctura. We conclude that it is safe and efficacious to use it as an anti-nocturnal treatment in elderly patients who have multiple sclerotic disease. The aim of this study is to determine whether desmolpressin can be used as a preventive or curative treatment for adult patients with pleuria. It has been shown that desmodeptin can induce hyponartremia in older men without any risk of adverse effects. This paper also discusses the effect of salgaraged furosemidde and desmostin on the treatment of adults with noctria."
22643828,"In this paper, the working group demonstrates that cultural differences between members of the EHSH board can be easily overcome by education and ""coming back to the principle of evidence-based medicine"". The conclusion is that there is little difference in late discomfort after Shouldice repair compared to laparoscopic surgery. A third of workers loses a median weight 31 pounds per week; range pounds 3 pounds 200. Conclusions There are many potential cost savings and improved patient care with longer use of mesh technique, outpatient surgical techniques, and local Anaesthesia."
31165921,"Conclusions In this paper, we summarize the results of a randomized, open-label, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial of DBT in treatment of depressed young people. The results suggest that DBT is a suitable and efficacious treatment for patients who have not yet responded to evidence-based treatment for depression. Although there are some drawbacks with the study, such as the small size of the sample and the lack of an adequate placebo condition, Consciousness concludes that it is necessary to further investigate whether or not DBT can be used as an effective treatment for treatment-refracted patients."
24123837,"In this paper, the effects of surface treatments on bond strength are outlined. Abrasions increase the bond strength to both Zirconia and Cercon, but no significant changes are found in the shear bonding abilities of these two types of cements. The results suggest that there is a strong relationship between the power of the light and the strength of the heat-shocking device. Adhesesive failures are the most common, followed by artificial aging and airborne particle blasting. All three methods result in improved long-term bond strength for either type of cement. Airborne powder etching improves the performance of resin cements with respect to bond strength. Silica coating increases the bonds strength of both Type 1 and Type 2 surfaces."
17667645,"This paper focuses on the effects of exercise and lifestyle changes on patients who have been treated with myocardiasis. It concludes that ""primary prevention"" approaches, such as physical exercise and diet, are more effective than ""neither-exercise"" approaches in terms of improving blood pressure and heart function. However, it does not seem to be possible for women to benefit from this type of intervention. Nurse-led preventive care improves health and reduces hospital admissions within the first year of treatment. In particular, there is a significant reduction in risk factor severity after only one year of follow-up visits. The results suggest that home-based cardial rehabilitation may be an effective strategy for relieving acute myomyocardial atheroscomatose disease."

17443609,"Short-term drains increase postoperative fever but do not increase other complications, such as pulmonary infection or wound infection. In this group of patients, the frequency of wound infection and other complications is much lower than those in the other group. The results suggest that short-term irrigation may prevent these complications from occurring. This study furthermore suggests that closed-supction drains are superior to open drains for both laparoscopic and elective choecychstectomy because they tend to be less aggressive and have a shorter duration of follow-up. A number studies have attempted to improve the efficacy of long-term drainage by comparing the use of drains with passive drains. These studies conclude that ""prophylactic drainage"" after elective surgery is unnecessary and should be avoided."
14870716,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates that the FFLTC exercise program can be used as a ""broad-based intervention"" to reduce the rate of ADL decline in elderly patients. He concludes by stating that both exercises are effective at reducing falls and improving functional status for long-term nursing home residents who are frail or have mild demented conditions. This paper also discusses the use of short-term balance training exercises to improve balance in older people. The results of the study suggest that an appropriate exercise program may be more effective in preventing falls than it is in improving physical function."

22094998,"In this paper, we examine the effects of a lottery on the likelihood that heroin and cocaine drinkers will eventually abstinece. We find that the odds of winning are higher than those of other treatment groups. This suggests that financial incentives may be effective in reducing smoking among patients with a long-term history of drug use."

29420053,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the effects of different types of fats on lipoprotein and lipid profiles in patients with Type 2 diabetes. They conclude that monounsulated fats are more effective than their saturated fats in reducing blood cholestrol levels but that they do not appear to have any significant effect on other lipids. Furthermore, these results suggest that high-mufa, low-fat foods may be better for reducing risk of cardiovascular disease among women with Type 2, especially those with type 2 Diabetes. The aim of this study is to determine whether or not consumption of olive oil can be used as a preventative measure against CVD."
25040784,"This paper presents the results of a large-scale, long-term observational study on the efficacy of sitting and workstations as a preventative measure against musculodysculoskeletal pain.

12496220,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft systematically examines the effects of feeding preterm or term infants with either breast milk or whey on their growth and length during early post-conceptional life. He concludes that ""expressing breast milk"" is inadequate for immature premature infants because it contains low levels of glyceric and lipolytic fatty acids, which are not readily absorbed by newborns. The results suggest that feeding with human milk may reduce the risk of infection in preterm babies."
28496859,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of a series of studies that have been performed on patients with acute fist-fighting. The most important conclusion is that ""Vernkalant was safe"" and effective in treating patients who had an episode of sudden atrial fibrilation after heart surgery. We also discuss the use of ranolzine as an antianginal treatment for patients with recent onset of arrhythmic disease. This study suggests that ranolazie can be used as an alternative to conventional drug therapy in patients suffering from severe heart failure."
23786819,"In this paper, the authors present a meta-analysis of the efficacy of a low Glycemic Loaf diet in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. They conclude that a moderate amount of refined carbohydrates may be more effective in reducing the risk of heart disease than a high consumption of refined fat. Although there is some disagreement as to whether these diets should be used for weight loss, the results suggest that they are safe and can be used as preventative measures against excessive weight."
31267483,"Walking for 30 minutes a day improves blood pressure and body composition in patients who are already walking. Short bouts of moderate-intensity exercise increase the risk of heart attack but do not lead to significant changes in body fatness. A randomized, controlled trial comparing short bouts with longer bouts is presented."
29481342,"The results of this study suggest that patients' expectations about pain and function prior to shoulder surgery are an independent predictor of improved functional outcome. Postoperative depression, anxiety, and insomnia do not predict poor outcomes after a rotator-cuff tear repair. However, we conclude that successful treatment may lead to improved psychological status and higher health status in patients with degenerate shoulder pain."
31461147,"The results of this study suggest that the use of a low-dose regimen is safe and effective in preventing hot flushing. However, there are some drawbacks: women's attitudes toward HRT seem to be more positive when they have lower body weight than when they do not. In addition, exercise training leads to significant improvements in lean fat mass and improved insulin action in responders to high doses of HRT. This suggests that menopause may lead to gains in fat mass but does not prevent changes in overall body composition. Sarcopenia is an important risk factor for falls among older adults because it increases the risk of falls over 5 years. Women with sarcolia tend to have poorer physical health after menopardy. Hormone replacement therapy seems to partially reduce these effects by slowing down the change in muscle transcriptome."
28286250,"In this paper, we present the results of a randomized, double-blind, feirt-controlled trial of gyroscopic surgery in older patients. We conclude that preoperative training and physical exercise are more effective in reducing morbidity and length of stay than conventional care. Furthermore, bed rest is associated with declines in lean mass and muscle strength in elderly patients. These results suggest that postoperative training should be combined with physical exercises to improve recovery after major surgery."
27799615,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to improving patients' health with telemedicine. They describe two groups of patients: 1) an outpatient group who receives regular care; and 2) a group of patients who receive only short-term intervention in order to improve their blood glucose control. The first group is designed to be more patient-centered and focused on self-reporting medication adherence while the second group is targeted at African Americans with Type 2 diabetes. Both groups have significant reductions in Hba1c levels over six months. These results suggest that there may be potential for further research into how best to deliver such a highly individualized treatment plan. This paper also discusses the use of telephone technology as a means of improving quality of care among patients with Type 1 or Type 2 disease."

22963896,"Conclusions This study shows that fluoxetine is more efficacious than placebo in treating patients with chronic depressive disorder. There are no significant differences in cost effectiveness between the three treatment options, but sertraline seems to be most effective for short-term relief of symptoms. In addition, it has been shown that imipramine and moclobemode are more effective than either of these agents in relieving the symptoms of severe depression. Although they do not appear to be as effective in elderly patients suffering from severe depression, further research is necessary to determine whether or not this type of treatment can be used in older patients."
26210190,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights focuses on the effect of abdominolysis on weight loss in patients with a high body mass. Liposuction is superior to liposputing in terms of fat reduction and improving body proportions; however, there is no evidence for recurrence of fat after surgery."

25862243,"Conclusions In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, observational study in which patients were treated with floatation therapy for their knee pain. A significant improvement was seen in all of the laboratory and follow-up measures. The patient's condition improved significantly over time. For example, there was a significant improvement in tenderness and stiffness in the group I only treatment. There was also a slight improvement in back pain in the other two treatment groups. Both treatments seemed to have beneficial effects on these patients. However, they did not show any difference in quality of life until nine months after conclusion. This is an indication that spa therapy can be used as a preventative measure against recurrent disease."
19588327,"In this paper, Bulpitt discusses the results of a recent study in which blood pressure reduction was associated with reduced risk of stroke and mortality. He concludes that early intervention is necessary in order to prevent further events from occurring. The main aim of the study is to randomize 1,000 patients over a five-year period. There are no significant differences between groups; however, both groups have an increased risk of death or stroke. Furthermore, neither group has a significant increase in the rate of fatal or nonfatal strokes. This report supports the need for a large multi-national trial in elderly people with ISH. Older patients and women underwent less intense cardiovascular intervention than younger patients when they were developing CHD. For example, Fatal and Non-fatal Stroke occurred in 59 patients in the dazem group but in 63 in the diurtic and beta blocker group. These results suggest that blood pressure decline per se didnot necessarily lead to parallel decrease in Cerbrovascular and Cardiovascular complications. However, these results support the continuing main Hyvet trial. A multinational trial will be conducted in elderly patients without comorbing conditions, social support, and socioeconomic status. Younger patients"
27599725,"This paper presents the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study of patients with new-onset acute fistfighting. It shows that these patients are more likely to die within one year than those who have been previously treated for stroke. In addition, it suggests that antithrombotics may be an effective treatment for this group of patients. The authors also discuss the use of risk-scoring methods such as the Cha2ds2-vasc score and the H(2)ardd score in prediction of stroke outcome. They conclude that ""new-onset aff"" is associated with worse long-term events and that previous aff was associated with higher mortality even at longer term followup. These findings emphasize the importance of early detection of rescorts for patients with known or newly-formed AF."
30985692,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a recent study on ankylososis. The authors conclude that NSAids and Cox-2-inhibitors have a ""clinically relevant"" effect on spine pain in patients with severe axspa. For every two patients treated with Etoricixb, one achieves a clinically meaningful improvement in spinal pain and basal area. Further studies need to be performed to determine how effective ecotoxib is in treating these conditions."
29466366,"Filtek ls performs well in the short-term treatment of posterior restoratives. A priori study selection, duplicate studies, and data extraction are more likely to lead to methodological weaknesses than those of other reviewers. In addition, there are no conflicts between any commercial organization and the five authors involved in the creation of the criterion reports. Conclusions In one group of class I or II restorations, there is no significant difference after one year between either system. After another root canal treatment, both systems showed good results with mostly ""Alfa scores"" for anatomy form, marginal adaptation, and surface textures. Bulfill material does not allow better margin adaption than standard composite. Both materials show good survival rate at three years follow-up."
28095788,"This paper focuses on the use of an evidence-based decision-support system to improve patientadherence to routine and preventive care measures for patients with Type 2 and Type 3 blood disease. The results suggest that this system can be used to improve practice practices in older people who are more likely to attend regular health checkups. In addition, it has been found that there is a significant increase in the frequency of laboratory and manual tests for certain types of diseases. Furthermore, the system seems to have a moderate or large increase in both establishment and new testing areas. Conclusions A prevention practitioner can improve the implementation of clinically important preventive and screening services in a Cost-effective manner."""
18491999,"Conclusions Post-MI Home-based exercise is more effective in improving TWC and Hr. In older patients, the benefits are similar to those of bicycle training. However, with less expensive treatment, it may be better to use FES as a stand-in-waiting intervention. The results suggest that home-based training can be an effective strategy to improve health in patients with chronic heart failing. Concluusions There is little evidence for the efficacy of this form of exercise on long-term improvement in quality of life."
29797031,"In this paper, the authors present evidence for the safety and efficacy of a single-use tourniquet for treating limb wounds. They conclude that it does not affect the amount or function of mitochondria in human skeletal muscles during TKA. However, they suggest that current practices at many institutions about lactate collection may be too stringent. Furthermore, their results suggest that ""non-tournizt use"" in TKA leads to less early postopment pain and improves recovery. The color-coated device did not increase laypeople's proportional ability to apply the guideline; however, this study replicated pilot studies on how well laypeople could apply the tool. Finally, we find no difference between surgeons trained on sims or live tissue training. More studies are required"

16117815,"In this paper, we describe the effects of short-term tetrical treatment on healthy older men with elevated levels of serum T. The results suggest that it is important for older men to be followed throughout their treatment and that long-term therapy should be avoided because of the risk of side effects. Oral Tu treatment of Type 2 diabetics with androgen deficiention improves blood sugar homeostases, body composition, and symptoms of and prostatic disease. Both testosterone and placebo treatments showed gains in lower leg muscle strength but did not show any change in PSA or other signs of prostate malignancy. A further study is needed to determine whether or not testosterone can produce meaningful changes in bone mineral density in elderly men with low concentrations of testosterone. Transdermal testing does not increase bone mineral density; however, it does lead to improvements in physical function and health perception.

19821398,"In this study, the effects of two different drugs on blood pressure are described. Two patients develop side effects: symptomatic orophotic hypotension and impotency in one patient; and combination therapy produces better efficacy than either single agent alone. The results show that both compounds produce significant reductions to blood pressure as compared to either monotherapies but no difference in sideeffects. All three regimens have been well tolerated by all four patients. A better treatment for hypertension is obtained with fixed combination capstopril 25mg/hyclorothizide 50mg once daily comparing to placebo or any component alone. No patient is withdrawed from the study because side effects were more commonly on L/Chlorothozide vs Lisiniopril. More importantly, Quinapril Plus HTZ provides increased reduction of distensible blood pressure up to 27.8 21.9 mmHg. This suggests that captopriml and renin-conversion inhibitors may be useful in treating essential hypertension when combined with other agents. These studies provide clear evidence that several dosage mixtures of ramimpril plus hydrogen chlorothia"

The outcome is that all patients are pleased with the care received and expresses a ""clear message"" to save their tooth whenever possible. Conscious of the importance of increasing public knowledge in endodonc treatment, the need for further studies is needed. Prognostic predictors of pain during root canal treatment were female, moral tooth size, age of pre-preparations pain, generalized swelling, single-visits treatment, and no other known cause of pain. A prophylactic dosage of Amoxicillin prevents flare-ups caused by necrotic or atraumatic pulpitis. Furthermore, confounding factors such as smoking, brushing, coping, and anxiety regarding cost affect the outcome of root canal treatments."

Anderson concludes by stating that it is important for physicians to use evidence from the medical literature when making decisions about treatment for their patients."
24887617,"In this chapter, the authors present a detailed description of the latest developments in the field of atrial ablation. They focus on patients who have ""PVI"" or ""LPeAF"" strategy and describe how these strategies can be used to improve their long-term results. For example, PVI isolation Plus L is superior to PVI alone in maintaining syphilis after procedures 1, 2, and 3; however, there are still significant relapses among those who have had PVI before. Concurrent metoprololil CR followed before cardioversion with prompt second heartbeat increase the proportion of patient in SR while six months follow-up was not important for an important difference between clinical events. These conclusions suggest that concomitants plus LL may be more successful in treating persistent atrial flutter than any other strategy. However, it is necessary to study further into the use of different antiarrhythmically drugs as they relate to the severity of the patient's condition. Finally, we conclude that both methods of ablation are safe and highly efficacious. We also discuss the advantages and drawbacks of various approaches to treatment of chronic atrial fibrillation.

They conclude that a diet high in fiber and low in fat may be more effective than a reduced carbohydrate diet for reducing blood sugar levels. The results of this study suggest that an individually tailored lifestyle intervention does not have additional effect on improving long-term CVD risk factors among people with fist-heart disease. A large weight loss program is effective as a preventive measure against type 2 diseases; such changes could significantly increase availability of such programs worldwide making immediate and significant Public health impact."

28914636,"This paper focuses on the protective effect of HGF on common cold in infants. It concludes that early-morning food consumption is associated with reduced risk of middle-childhood allergic disease and asthma. Conclusions We suggest that increasing maternal intake of nuts, milk, and wheat before pregnancy may reduce the risk of mid- childhood allergy or asthma. Consumption of hen's egg at four to six months of age reduces sensitization by egg-specific Ig G4, but this does not protect against breast-fed babies. In contrast, it might lead to frequent allergic reactions among children who have already been exposed to eggs. The study supports the hypothesize that early exposure to allergens can increase tolerance and lower risk of food allergy in young children."
27100114,"This paper focuses on the effects of repeated eccentric exercises on muscle function and injury. It concludes that early use of hypnotism can help relieve delayed onset soreness but that it does not improve range of motion or recovery after an exercise-induced injury. A significant reduction in muscle damage is evident only forROM when compared to fastvelocity exercises; however, secondary damage is less after fifty-eccentric exercises. Conclusions Protease seems attenuates muscle strength loss after eccentric exercise because it regulates leukocyte activities and inflammation. In contrast, endurance training results in little blood oxidation stress as a result of eccentric exercise. Although there are no direct differences between bouts, confounding factors may be involved. After ECC1, both groups experience similar increases in muscle length and stiffness during the first two days after exertion. However, these results do not lead to improvements in muscle function following eccentric exercises."

30541103,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of our previous studies on sleep-deprivation. We find that it is common for adults to experience significant performance declines even when they are only allowed to sleep for six or less hours per night. These results suggest that there may be a biological basis for these changes in behavior. For example, children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder have more than twice the risk of developing adolescence than healthy adults."
28148655,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft discusses the different approaches to adjusting the position of the implant in total knee surgery. He concludes that the most common approach is the ""measured resection"" technique, which involves using an electrode to track the change in the location of the screw in the knee. The electrodes can be adjusted according to the patient's needs and the surgeon can make the best use of the new device."
26161741,"The present study concludes concisely that the effects observed extend over the 12 month postpartum time period. Probiotics can be used as a preventative measure for blood glucose control in patients with a malnourished background. In contrast, probiotics such as yeast and Lactobacillus strains have not been shown to improve blood glucose levels in humans."
22161373,"This paper discusses the use of parent-training as an early intervention for children with adhd who display high levels of antisocial behavior. It concludes that there is no advantage in using parent training to improve their child's social and emotional well-being, but it does suggest that parents should be more attentive to their children's needs than they are to their own. In addition, this study suggests that ""parental compliance-maternal skills and Overall style of interaction was also positively affected."" Parents were also better able to respond to treatment at longer intervals. The effects of medication plus hypnosis were not seen until 36 months; however, by 6 months, the earlier benefit of having been given 14 months had disappeared. Furthermore, both groups showed greater reduction of malaccomplishive behavior than either group did when given a higher dose of hypnostemini. However, these results do not seem to have anything to do with age-related changes in ADHD symptoms or change in medication intensity. For example, Medication Plus hypnotism resulted greatly reduced serious maladaptives than Med in children with prydoned DDDs. Conclusions In young children"
23840373,"Conclusions: High-dose IVD supplementation in patients with chronic obstructive rheumatism does not reduce the severity of their disease. In contrast, daily IVD is associated with improved bone growth and reduced risk of death among low birth weight infants. A weekly IVD was found to be more effective in improving bone growth than it did in preventing severe morbidities or death. This paper concludes that vitamin D may reduce the risk of influenza A in Mongolian children who are deficient in vitamin D. It also suggests that four monthly IVD should be given to prevent fractures in people living in the community. The results suggest that IVD may prevent fracture without adverse effects on men and women from the general community; further studies need to determine the effect of VD on infection."
25765866,"Conclusions The results of this study suggest that the self-etched, dentin-adheling clearfil se bond is not as good a material for long-term use as the other two. However, it does have some minor positive effects on the marginal coloration of the patient's enamel. After eight years of repeated use, the performance of the three-year-old system continues to be excellent with no significant difference in the appearance of superficially discolored margins. In contrast, the single-epimerized sealant Scotch Bond Multi Purpose performs very well after only one year of use."
32194129,"In this paper, Dr. Manette argues that psyched-out patients are not likely to suffer serious adverse events because of the small size of the sample. However, it is important to note that there are very few reported serious side effects of psychenic use. For example, in one study, a group of patients who had been taking psylocybin as part of their treatment for anxiety were found to have significant reductions in symptoms after just two weeks of treatment. This suggests that hypnotics can be used as a stand-alone treatment for mental health problems such as anxiety and depression."
25972247,"The aims of this paper are to describe the efficacy of different anesthetics in cats, and to compare their performance on pain-related behavior measures with those of healthy cats. All four drugs provide good post-opportunity for cats who undergo elective surgery; however, they do not improve wound tenderness or severity."
30345096,"In this paper, we describe the results of a novel pre-oppressive exercise regimen for patients with advanced lung disease who have a high risk of complications after surgery. We report that short-term pre-Operative Pulmonary Rehabilitation is superior to conventional medical therapy in terms of improving patient's health and quality of life."
32293469,"In this large-sample population of healthy men, we found that food intake was more efficiently transported by bacterial liposomes into the blood stream. This study adds to the understanding of why relations between food and metabolic diseases are involved. Furthermore, resistance dextern can improve inflammation and improve Type 2 diabetes in women with Type 2 disease. Conclusions The present study suggests that a diet containing prebiotics may be an effective strategy for reducing irrational stress in Type 2 patients."
28514886,"Preterm infants with a low birth weight were compared to controls in terms of growth, fecility, and survival. The results suggest that prebiotics may be useful for reducing the risk of nosocomisal complications in premature infants."
18842808,"In this paper, we report the results of a double-blind, quackery-controlled study in which glucogann was found to be an effective and safe dietary adjunct to a high-cholesterol diet. The main drawbacks were that it did not lead to additional weight loss; rather, it seemed to induce a primary reduction of alpha lipoprotein, most likely due to inadequate water consumption. Furthermore, these results suggest that ""glucomlann"" may be useful as a preventative measure against excessively high levels of cholesterrolemic blood."
24297836,This paper focuses on the use of acute mountain illness as a predictor of future incidents of acute sickness in adults and children.
32367221,"In this paper, we present the results of a randomized, controlled trial comparing the use of two different autograft types for ACL repair. The results are very similar in terms of pain and functional outcome. Although some differences have been seen earlier in the literature, these changes are not significant at 15 years post-opportunity. We conclude that there is no difference in the long-term quality of life between the two groups. Both devices provide good long- term objective and subjective outcomes. However, more patients with the PT type have greater instrumented Anteropostorsterior Translation measured by KT- 1000 than those with the Hs group. These results suggest that both auto Grafts may be suitable for knee replacement."
25038833,"In this chapter, we summarize the results of a recent study on elderly patients with mild to moderate memory loss. We conclude that darifenacenacin has no significant effect on memory but does not improve mental function in older people. Conclusions Acute strokes are associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of adverse effects from anticholineric drugs. This suggests that there may be a role for these drugs in the pathose of acute stroke."
16801507,The results of this study suggest that a combination of vitamin K1 and parathyroid-hormone therapy may be useful in preventing bone loss from osteopororosis caused by strontium-induced fractures.
11676811,"The results of this study suggest that education and exercise can be used as preventative measures against back pain. However, the studies do not show a significant reduction in sick leave or incidence of back pain when compared to control groups."
12719681,"Conclusions This paper focuses on the use of one-sem-criterion to identify changes in patients with breastcancer. It concludes by describing how poor scores on both the Short-Grade Questionnaire and the Quality-of-Life scale are associated with long-term remission for patients with chest disease. Physical exercise can improve physical function, but it is not associated with improved lung function or exercise tolerance. In contrast, rehabilitation of patients at home can improve their quality of life; however, this improvement does not lead to an improvement in other important health-related measures."
26830881,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the efficacy and tolerability of clorpramine and paronoxetine in patients with late-life panic disorder: Hamilton Anxiness Scores were significantly lower than those with similar genotypes. The most common aes for qutia pine Xr were headache and nausea. Genotype differences for Pacap/PAC1 showed better treatment outcome in generalized anxious disorder. Conclusions That persisting antidepressants does not lead to relapses after 12 or 24 months of treatment do not seem to increase the severity of the patient's condition. However, it is suggested that concomitant treatments such as psychoactive drugs may have a beneficial effect on the long term course of anxiety disorder."
28611377,"This paper focuses on the association between atrial fillation and stroke. In patients with moderate to high risk of stroke, those who have persistent af have a greater risk of death than paroxysmal AF. Conclusions That this is because of their higher risk for early death from recurrent or unknown type of stroke. These results do not favor anticoagulation treatment in patients with severe aecdote. The most important finding here is that there is no significant increase in mi after warfarin when compared with other myocare regimens. Aortic disease is associated with left atrium stasis as well as with left-atrial embolism; these findings add to concerns about the severity of a patient's life. Atrial Fillation is independent risk factor for AMI. Men with a Cha2ds2-vasc score less than 0 are more likely to develop a major heart attack than women without aristocratic history. Stroke is also an independent riskfactor of AMI among healthy women."
28449030,"In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the indirect effects of immunition on public health in four different settings: 1) households with high access to care; 2) religious social networks; and 3) cluster-based approaches. We find that direct protection is evident in these studies, but not in cluster designs. The strongest community effect was likely due to the proportion of neighboring compounds with treated Nets. Conclusive conclusions are drawn from estimates of how inference would change under violation of identification assumptions. This paper also discusses some of the issues involved in evaluating complex intervention strategies."
27888169,"This paper describes a new patient-centered, web-based approach to managing Type 2 diabetes. It uses telemedicine technology to track blood pressure and changes in body weight over time. In the control group, there is no significant improvement in A1c while body weight is stable. The results suggest that this new approach may be useful for improving patients' self-reports of medication adherence as well as for controlling risk factors among African American patients with Type 2 disease. Conclusions furthermore suggests that an ""electrified"" primary care setting may be more effective than routine care when it comes to treating type 2 patients. An area-wide, machine-based system improves laboratory monitoring but does not improve glyceric control. Conscious of the need for cost-effectiveness, these studies are under way at Boston Veterans Administration Hospital."
20088746,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a recent study on cobalamin in elderly patients. It was found that moderate dosages of cynocobalmin were as effective as parenteral treatment in treating anemia caused by co balancemin-deficiency. We conclude that this is due to the fact that it is more cost effective and easier to administer than other forms of treatment."
27040323,"In this paper, we summarize the results of a large number of observational and randomized studies. We find that probiotics such as B infantis,S thermophilus, and B Lactis significantly reduce the risk of developing necrotizing Enterocolitis or other complications in prematurely bred infants but do not lead to severe mortality. Furthermore, there is no evidence that enterococulins can prevent the occurrence of these complications in low birth weight infants."
20379700,"A randomized, controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a self-management education program for postmenstrual women with Osteoporotic fractures. It was found that this program improved balance and quality of daily function, as well as improved pain perception. In addition, it improved bone loss in both groups. The results were not statistically significant; however, there was a strong association between exercise and health status. This study is important because it will help determine whether or not physicians should recommend specific treatments for patients with osteoperosis."
28616252,"A pilot study is a method of evaluating the safety and efficacy of an exercise intervention in a prospective, randomized, controlled fashion. It is important to note that such studies do not necessarily have sufficient power to predict the long-term effects of the intervention. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a pilot trial before the main study so as to ensure that there is sufficient pre-specified sample size. This paper also discusses the importance of conducting a ""pilot study"" prior to the actual study. Pilot studies are more cost effective than direct mailouts because they usually involve multiple patients who will be required to wait several weeks for their results. However, this does not allow enough time to recruit large numbers of participants. Thus, many methods are employed to reach these goals. The most costeffective strategy is to use consultant mail outs; however, this method only leads to costly extension of the project either by using this method alone or by failing to reach the predeterminated number of participants needed for sufficient scientific power. Further research is needed on home-based exercises for people with Multiple Sclerosis."
30045708,"This paper focuses on the use of trigger points to treat shoulder pain in patients with acute or chronic shoulder pain. It uses a case series as an evidence base for the efficacy of this treatment. The results suggest that passive muscle therapy may be effective in relieving shoulder pain, although further studies are required."
31760943,"Hamilton et al conclude this paper by describing the effects of a daily ham-rs2 capsule on blood glucose control, lipid concentrations, and body composition in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Although there are no specific studies to confirm this efficacy, it is clear that consuming a large amount of ruminant starch for six weeks can reduce blood glucose levels and improve fasting erythmia in overweight adults."
24717371,"In this study, we examine the effects of a daily iron-supplementation regimen on endurance capacity and body composition in female runners. We find that women who are prelatent or latent iron deficient show little improvement in their physical performance compared to those who are physically active."
26005199,"The results of a three-arm randomized trial suggest that the use of mindfulness-based stress reduction to improve quality of life in patients with fms may be an effective treatment option. However, there are some drawbacks: the cost of the intervention is higher than that of other mind-body treatments; and while both groups show improvement in depressed symptoms, there is no clear relationship between the two groups."
29353323,"In this chapter, the authors present a novel approach to treating children with ADHD by using an extended-spectrum drug called Oros MPH. They show that it can be used as a stand-alone treatment for children with both mild and severe forms of the disorder. The effects of the two drugs are described in terms of their effect on classroom behavior and learning. This paper also discusses the use of a modified version of the Dyser Rating Scale to predict whether or not long-term efficacy is associated with changes in symptoms."
