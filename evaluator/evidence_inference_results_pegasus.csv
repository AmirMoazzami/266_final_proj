This result may be explained by the implicit aggregation of many prognostic factors underlying this judgment and suggests the relevance of considering the patients from biopsychosocial and longitudinal points of view .
It is unlikely that any intervention focusing on a single factor would ever fit the needs of most patients ; interventions targeting determinants from several fields ( mainly psychosocial , biomechanical , and occupational ) may be more relevant .
Finally , in the third study , the prevalence of psychosocial comorbidity in chronic LBP patients was not found to be significantly higher than in other patients consulting in primary care .
Rather than specifically screening for psychosocial conditions , this suggests taking into account any potential comorbidity in patients with chronic LBP , as in other patients .

30293906,"EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS The most studied combination therapy for the treatment of male LUTS is the α1-adrenoceptor antagonist/5α-reductase inhibitor combination .
This combination seems to be more efficacious in terms of several outcome variables , in particular in men who have moderate-to-severe LUTS and are at risk of disease progression .
Also in terms of nocturia improvements , this combination is significantly more effective than the monotherapy .
The other often studied combination treatment , in both male and female patients with LUTS , was the combination of antimuscarinics ( in particular solifenacin ) and mirabegron .
This combination seems to be more effective in comparison with the monotherapies with respect to urinary incontinence and urgency urinary incontinence episodes and several other objective and subjective parameters , without relevant increase of adverse events .
The combination of hormone therapy and antimuscarinics in women with LUTS does not seem to be useful .
For the treatment of LUTS in men and women , combination therapy appears to be a promising option to optimize the efficacy of the available drugs for those who do not experience sufficient benefit with monotherapy .
This add-on scenario offers the possibility to have a more tailored approach to the management of LUTS , always seeking the optimal balance between efficacy and tolerability for a given patient .

The combination of a SERM with estrogen as a tissue selective estrogen complex ( TSEC ) is a new strategy for the prevention of bone loss and the treatment of climacteric symptoms .
This combination is particularly interesting from a clinical point of view , taking into account that estrogen alone did not increase breast cancer risk by the Women 's Health Initiative .
TSEC is hypothesized to provide the benefits of estrogen-alone therapy , with an improved tolerability profile because the SERM component can make possible the elimination of progestin .

20149117,"The authors even suggested in this case increasing educational levels as a means of reducing obesity .
Indeed , we have recently reported results from two experimental studies showing that mental work up-regulates appetite-stimulating hormones and promotes overconsumption of food ( 3,4 ) .
Furthermore , a careful examination of our data revealed that when the subjects were categorized on the basis of the mental workload intensity , those for whom the intensity of the mental effort was greater significantly increased their spontaneous food intake as compared with those characterized by a less strenuous cognitive effort .
In other words , the harder we think the more we eat .
This hyperphagic effect of intense thinking was also accompanied by more plasma glucose instabilities ( 5 ) .
The fluctuations in plasma glucose levels that were observed are in agreement with the literature showing that a period of intense cognitive processing leads to a measurable decrease in levels of blood glucose ( 6 ) , a fall that has also been associated with feeling less energetic ( 7 ) .
Accordingly , food intake might be perceived as a strategy for allowing the individual to recover optimal body functioning .
These observations are also relevant for students having hard times to learn at school and for whom study ing is arduous and mentally challenging .
On the basis of our observations , we find it realistic to postulate that those susceptible to commit more cognitive effort to take in charge st and ard mental tasks are more likely to over-eat and gain weight compared with those for whom the accomplishment of mental tasks at the same level of performance is elementary or more natural .
Along the same lines , it would not be surprising to find a higher dropout rate for those ‘ mentally stressed ’ students .
In a system where academic performance continues to rank as high priority in public schools , it seems obvious that some students are genetically more gifted and likely to perform at a higher level ( 8) .
As previously shown , better cognitive abilities are predictive of more important life achievements such as earning a doctorate , securing a patent , or publishing a novel or major literary work ( 9 ) .
It may be somewhat paradoxical that the amount of knowledge-based work is more important in the higher socioeconomic groups whereas population data show a higher prevalence of obesity for the socioeconomically disadvantaged .
Thus , individuals highly involved in mental work are not all likely to over-eat and other healthy behaviours such as regular physical activity may counterbalance the net impact on energy balance .
As mentioned in the paper by Yu and co-workers ( 1 ) , educational attainment seems to be an important mediator of this relationship .",It was concluded that higher blood glucose levels are associated with feeling less tense' 'Previous studies have found a small association between the level of blood sugar and subjective reports of energy in those sitting quietly.,0.47549288456364325
