As per the evidence , prebiotics modulate the composition of human intestine microflora to the benefit of the host by suppression of colonization of harmful microorganism and /or the stimulation of bifidobacterial growth , decreased stool viscosity , reduced gastrointestinal transit time , and better feed tolerance .","In this paper, the authors present a detailed description of the intestinal feal community in infants. They compare the different types of bacilli and their relative proportions to breastfed infants'. The results show that the prebiotic mixture induces an adult-like ""fecalmicrobiota"" which closely resemble those found in breastfed babies. This study is designed to determine whether enteral supplementing with short-chain gallacto-OLIGOSACCHARDES or long-chain Fruco-oligorigosacchardes improves intestinal permeabilities in preterm children. Preterm infant women are not affected by the changes in gut permeability as measured by sugar absorption tests in the first weeks of life. However, they do not increase the decrease in intestinal permeation in the last week of pregnancy. Furthermore, there is no significant difference in the ratio of bacterial counts between the two groups. Thus, it is important to take into account the levels of briskness when assessing the effect of entryal supplementation on the health of newborns.",0.5692230871271611

Forty one mountaineers are studied during an ascent to 3,500 m above sea level in order to assess their symptoms. They were divided into two groups: subjects with acute mountain illness and subjects without arising from the disease. The first group was younger than the second group, and both groups had different resting blood pressures. This study is important because it will allow us to better understand the role of venous growth factor in acute mountain illnesses.

The QT autograft detected the reduced rate of AKP than the PT .
Quadriceps tendon autograft may represent a feasible option for primary ACL reconstruction .","The first four months after ACL-reconstruction are described in this paper. After two weeks, patients undergo a series of exercises to improve their knee function. At the end of these studies, there is little difference in pain and symptoms between the two groupings. In contrast, both groups have similar pain at 4 months. Both groups also report higher sports activity scores than those in the other group. This study concludes that neither type of autograft can be used for ACL reconstructation because of reduced harvest site symptoms and high injury rates. However, both types provide good long- term subjective and objective outcome. Short-term results show no differences in functional outcome or quality of life when compared with one another. Seventeen years later, no significant differences will be seen among the two groups. Functional outcome questions such as the modified Cincinnati knee Rating system and the International knee Documentation Committee are used to assess patient's functional and health status after knee surgical procedures.

The results show that darifenachin causes significant memory decline but does not lead to any significant changes in other measures of mental function. We conclude that future studies need to look at elderly patients who have mild or moderately depressed mental health. Overactive bladders are common among the elderly because they are susceptible to drug-induced cognitive impairment. Darifinacin, an M1 selective antagonist, improves short term memory and executive functions in elderly people without clinical dementia. This study is designed to assess the relationship between cumulative use of antichollicity drugs and memory and brain function in elderly men.

Twenty patients treated with chronic gypsy are given 15mg of vitamin K2, while 10 patients receive only 15ml of glucocarticoidin. The results show that the reduction in Osteocalcin induces bone loss. A phase 3 trial has been performed on 1649 post-menopaausal women who received strontium runelate for three years. Strontium reduced fractures in the first two years but did not increase bone mineral dentity. Women receiving higher levels of uclacinate osteocalcin had a lower relative risk of fracture than those receiving low levels.

We find six treatments for which 50 are reported; only 10 of them agree. For each treatment, biases may irretrivevably weigh the outcome of these controls in favor of another type of treatment. A study is designed to compare two different exercise regimens on patients with back pain. After a one-year training program, patients were divided into three groups: a Calisthenic's program, a Back School program, and /control group. The results indicate that the calistheics program was superior to the control group because of the increased trunk forward flexor and initial increment in abdominable abdominal muscle strength. Further studies are needed to determine whether intensity or type of exercise can be used to prevent lowback pain. Both programs reduce absenteeiism by a significant amount.

The mean daily doses for paroixepam and clonalzepam were 1.9 and 38.4, respectively; the mean daily dosages for pre gabalin were 3.87mg/d and 42.2, respectively. Both treatments reduce the number of anxious attacks and severe anxiety. In addition, both treatment groups have significantly reduced the frequency of these attacks. A significant proportion of the cumulative improvement in anxiety- related sleep disturbances is explained by itsdirect effect not mediated after improvements in anxiety severity. Two studies are presented: first, a prospective observational study on generalized anxiety disease that uses a Hamilton Anxiness Rating scale as predictors regarding remission. Second, he examines the effects of serotoninergic signaling on panic disorder. He concludes that there is a significant interaction between the SerotonIN transporter gene -- La/La or La/S Or S/S -- and the HTR2-A single-nusculotide Polymorphism -- rs75997012 which has been associated with improved treatment outcome in generalized anxieties. Finally, this study investigates the efficaciousness of quetivelin fumarate as maintenance monothérapie for patients with Generalized Agoraphobic Disorder.

He uses counterfactual theories to predict these effects in a cluster-rand-omized study with households of small two-person households. The results show that there is no evidence of direct protection from disease when compared to those received by placebo groups. This suggests that herd protection might not be as strong as community protection due to considerable transmission between clusters. Two recent studies suggest that women's groups are effective in preventing neonatal death in poor communities. One trial shows that women can reduce maternal mortality in three rural Bangladeshi districts. A second trial compares immunition rates among children aged 1 or 3 and finds that only modest incentives improve immunisations rate but does not have a substantial impact on immunisesation rates. Two other studies indicate that women could reduce neonatial mortality in poor areas because of their increased participation in health care.

It uses a combination of remote patient monitoring and complete feedback loops to assess changes in blood glucose levels over six months. The results indicate that both groups have significant improvements in their blood pressure control. A1c values are reduced by 0.70 percent in usual care and by 1.11 percent in treatment group. In contrast, change in medication is associated with lower HbA1,1c levels. These results suggest that web-based management may be useful in improving type 2 diabetes care. Two studies examine the effect of an organization-based approach on improved blood pressure controls in patients who have poorly controlled Type 2 disease. One study investigates the effects of using a multicoponent organizational intervention for improvement in quality andefficiency of care; the second study evaluates a system designed to improve self-management in adults with Type 1 disease. The first study compares the benefits of a shared medical record with those of routine care. The second study determines the impact of ""an area-wide, computerized diabetes register"" on process of care but does not affect physiologic or metabolic control. The third study tests the efficacy of telephone nurse follow up as a tool for improving health care in older people with Type 3 disease.

Conclusion Our review highlights the existing research and provides a case study which assesses important metrics of study feasibility .","This paper focuses on pilot studies, or ""feasibility"" studies, which are designed to advance the scientific validity of an intervention before its main trial is conducted. It also discusses some ethical aspects involved in pilot studies and suggests how to report results of pilot studies using the Consolr statement. The purpose for these studies is to describe information related to the success of this proposed main trial; not in the trials that are served as feasibility or Pilot studies. In particular, it describes the importance of having a pilot during the preparation of a final RCT. Although many pilot studies have been published, no study has yet reported details on effective recruitment strategy for large- scale r and Omizedcontrolled trials. A detailed outline of recruiting strategies is given. These include attendance at outpatient centers, consulting mailouts, trial awareness raising activities, and cost estimation. However, most patients are too active to participate in the planned exercise intervention. There are only two methods for successful patient recruitment: 1) attending outpatient physicians, 2) consulting mail-out services, and 3) trial awarenessraising activities. Thus, there are three major reasons for participation: 1) being too active, 2) traveling to the study sites, and/or 3) needing to travel more frequently. Therefore, various approaches were used to recruit participants. For example, one method was employed to recruit people with multiple Sclerosis who had mild to moderated disability. To reach target numbers in a time frame, several methods were employed. Finally, we developed a Framework for Defining Pilot and Foasible Trials concentrating on studies conducted prior to a future controlled trial. We described a definition of pilot and foasibly studies, but did not explicitly apply to other pilot and foil studies. They differ from those found in randomised control trials, such as pilot and flotius studies. Many pilot studies do not directly relate to internal pilot experiments built into the designs of 'a main trial', 'non-r and momized pilot and Featsibility studies', or phase I studies. Some important differences in the types of information and interpretation of the Consoli date D St and Ards of reporting Trials are discussed.",0.504116719198678

Here, we evaluate the benefits of enriched Chicory inculination on liver proteomes, renal profile, and inflammation in patients with Type 2Diatribe. After eight weeks of intervention, combined XyloOLIGOSACCHARDE AND LACTOLLUCIUM resulted in reduced SBP / DBP, Serum MDA / TNF, and Enzymatic Profiles in patients who had Type 2DM. They also showed improved changes in body weight, waist circumfference, and blood sugar. Probiotic treatments seem to reduce liver fat but do not affect other measures of health.",0.12117633865648265
30511328,"Network meta- analysis revealed that in adolescents , intervention with 2000 mg/day metformin ranked better than other interventions ; however , 1000 mg/day metformin for 3 months may be most suitable for adolescents .
For adults , metformin at doses of 3000 and 1000 mg/day ranked the highest , other than minimeal and lifestyle interventions ; moreover , intervention with 3000 mg/day for 6 months and 1000 mg/day for 0.5 months may be suitable for adults .
Conclusion When considering the efficacy of interventions for losing weight , metformin offers clear advantages for overweight and obese population","In this paper, the authors present a doubleblind, placebo controlled study of 29 white-and-black American adolescents aged 12-18 years with fasting blood concentrations greater than 15  U/mL. The subjects were divided into three groups: 1) patients who had severe obesity; 2) patients with family history of Type 2 diabetes; and 3) patients who did not have any significant changes in their body mass index or waist circumference. This study is an attempt to evaluate the efficaciousness of meetingformin in treating obese patients without type 2 diabetes. Although metformin does not improve blood pressure or blood glucose levels, it reduces total cholesterol, abdominal obesity, and C-Reactive Protein levels in obese patientswithout diabetes. Two studies are presented that describe the effects of combination diet and exercise for improving body weight, fat distribution, and hormonal changes in obese children. One examines whether metformine can prevent excessive weight loss in overweight children while another examines the effect of combined lifestyle intervention on improved body weight and body composition. A mixed treatment comparison is used to assess the relative effectiveness of two different treatments. For example, one group receives 1,500 millig/mmol daily for six months, while the other receives only 500 milliog per day for twelve months.",0.7458759762279475
17595425,"Heterogeneity between studies indicates that the Morse Falls Scale and STRATIFY may still be useful in particular setting s , but that widespread adoption of either is unlikely to generate benefits significantly greater than that of nursing staff clinical judgment","In this study, we examine the performance of the Stroke Risk Assessment tool as used in patients recovering from an acute stroke. The results suggest that it is not a good predictor for falls and that there is no way to use the tool to predict future falls. A multiple-intervention fall prevention program reduces the proportion of people who experience falls during their stays in the hospital. This was particularly significant in the first three months after discharge. However, when the intervention group had a greater risk of falling than the control group, they experienced a trend toward reduction in the frequency of falls. Furthermore, the method did not have any predictive power in terms of whether or not someone will fall. We further assess the reliability of the elderly mobility scale, which has been used to predict falls among elderly patients. All patients with one or more risks factors that predispose them to falls are randized to receive blue identification bracelet; however, only those with high risk factors were omically assigned to receive no bracelet. Thus, all patients with two or more risk characteristics were stratified by receiving either a white identification bracelet or none at all. These subjects fell less than once but yielded a ratio of '1.3'. To further test the efficiacy of using a single-step approach to prevent falls, a prospective case-control trial was conducted in Swedish hospitals. It showed that nursing care was inadequate in predicting how many patients would fall while on bed. There was little improvement in the relative rate of recorded falls between the treatment group and control group. Finally, the Peter James Center Fall Risk Assessment Tool was developed to predict the risk offalls in older patients. Although the accuracy of these tools was good, neither nurses nor physicians could be trusted to accurately predict falls.",0.009280771716105913

The preference for cementless acetabular components on the basis of improved survivorship is not supported by the published evidence .
Although concerns regarding aseptic loosening of cemented acetabular components may have led North American surgeons toward the nearly exclusive use of cementless acetabular components , the available literature suggests that the fixation of cemented acetabular components is more reliable than that of cementless components beyond the first postoperative decade","In this study, we examine the long- term results of the elite plus femor stem in a series of young patients. The mean survival rate was 90.0 percent with any revision at the end point and the mean annual wear of the Polyethylene liner were 0.17mm per year. A third generation cementing technique, accurate alignment of the stem to the use of an 22 mm Zirconia Head were important factors for the prevention of excessive loosening from the Elite Plus prostess in these high risk young patients."" There were thirteen hips who died after follow-up. Forty-five patients were excluded because their medical condition was not well. Thirteen hips had a reverie; seventy five had aseptic looseening. After six months, there was neither significant difference in the clinical or radiographic outcome between the cemented cup or the uncemed Duraloc Cup after 10 years.

Thirtily six patients were assigned to either group; one group received mud packs or heat baths while the other was assigned to control groups. The results showed that balnotherapy was more effective in relieving pain and improving sleep than the control group. A further study was performed on 24 patients with fms who had been assigned two groups: group 1 received 20min bathing once a week and 5 days per week; group 2 received no bathing but did not receive any physical exercise. This study found significant improvement in both pain and fatigue in the treatment group. However, there was no difference in tender point scores between the two groups. Furthermore, pool-based exercises seemed to have a longer lasting effect on most of the symptoms of Fms.

They find that people with similar health traits are more likely than others to form new ties because they are involved in multiple social relationships. The results for BMI suggest that people who are similar to other people are less likely not to dissolve existing friendships but rather become new ones. For example, smoking to non-moker is the least likely tie to form while those with similar physical characteristics are most likely to do so. Hophily also dependes on geography separation. Wiley's work suggests that human interactions are highly cooperative and organized; however, there have been no experiments to demonstrate how these structures can influence the behavior of subjects. He uses an experiment to test the effect of ""voluntary costly punishment"" on humans' cooperation. When subjects play a single-shot game with strangers, subjects break their links and form new ones with them. This leads to large-scale change in the structure of the social system. Social networks often act as a buffer between individuals and one another. These studies confirm the predictions made by a set or omgraph modeling study about the role of social networks in support of large- scale human cooperation. We use an experiment where subjects were assigned to different groups to participate in public goods games without being members of the initial group. It shows that subjects are influenced directly by fellow group member's contribution in future interaction with other subjects who weren't a party at the initial interaction. Furthermore, it shows that each additional subject contributes to the public Good in the first time only increases the probability of sharing food with households connected together.",0.007614199932217311

For cemented tibial components there was no difference in migration between all-poly and metal-backed components , between mobile bearing and fixed bearing , between cruciate retaining and posterior stabilized .
Furthermore , no difference existed between TKR measured with model-based RSA or marker-based RSA methods .
For uncemented TKR there was some variation in migration with the highest migration for uncoated TKR .
Interpretation - The results from this meta- analysis on  RSA migration of TKR  are in line with both the survival analyses results from joint registries of these TKRs as well as revision rates results from meta-analyses , thus providing further proof for the association between early migration and late revision for loosening .","In this study, we compare the effects of six months of clodrone treatment on the movement of the Nexgen knee prosthesis in patients who undergo total knee replacement. After four years, there is no difference in the rate of migrating the prosthesis by molestation. The only remaining difference is that at 4 years, the motility of the prothesis is reduced. This suggests that it may be possible to reduce loosening during this time period. A previous study examined the effect of fixed bearings on the migration of partially cemented and partially uncemented high-flexion prostheses. The overall mean differences between the four designs were not significantly different for the other two design s. However, they were comparable at two and 5 years postomission. The final results are similar: after five years, all but three of the LPS-FFFF devices showed continuous migration.

In this study, we found no significant differences between group groups in the rates of falls. There were no significant interaction between disease severity and disease severity for physical function measures. However, there was also a trend that more falls occurred in the exercises group than controls. This suggests that an exercise program targeted balance, leg strength, and freezing gait did indeed reduce falls but improve physical and psychological quality of life.

In this study, the relative risk for hip fracture from high-dose treatment was found to be 1.69 compared with that of the highest-quartile concentration of 25-OHHD. This suggests that higher doses of Vitamin D may prevent hip fracture in older people who are not deficient in their levels of 25 H.D. A case-conhort study has been performed to determine whether an inverse relationship between 25 Hh.D and hip breakage occurs in patients with lower levels of blood D.

Further studies are needed to determine whether intensity versus Type of exercise is more effective than type of exercise by comparison with similar intensity. In this study, patients reported neck, shoulder, and back pain were evaluated after 12 and 24 months. No significant differences were found between the three treatment groups; however, improvements in lower back pain was registered within both interventions for up to an 18-month period.

The directionality of this relationship appears to depend on the type and timeframe of load measured","In this study, the incidence and association of injury with type and quantity of training in young international rowers is described. The injury rate was 3.67 per 1,000 exposure hours; the mean number of injured injuries per athlete was 2.32.. This results in an increase in injury risk for both male and female rowers than most other sports. Athletics are at higher risks of injury than any other contact sport or some contact sport. Study 1: A prospective cohort study examines injury incidence among high-level athletics from various team/individual sports and investigates if sport involvement patterns are associated to injuries. Two studies relate injury incidence to injury frequency in young high level athletes from various club and individual sports. These studies suggest that there exist differences of injury risk depending on the period of season and therefore injury prevention strategies must be introduced from before the season begins. Injury incidence in professional American football players is investigated according to playing positions. Ligament Sprains account for 50 %) of all injuries, and the highest incidental injury occurs during preseason as well as after the competition period.

They describe eighteen women who have undergone an elective surgery and are given either usual care, 8 adjunctives of supportive attention, or 8 adjourning hypnosiastic sessions. The results show that the hypnotis group is more effective than the usual control group in terms of wound healing through 7 weeks. A further study suggests that using hypnoses can speed wound healing by reducing psychological stress. This study also examines the effect of ""patient-centered"" approaches on preoperative anxieties and surgical outcomes. It shows that patients with patient-centered approaches tend to be less anxious and painlier after surgery than those without patient-centred approaches.

We conclude that there is no association between these two nutrients but that they do not increase the severity of depressed symptoms over time. The results support the notion that high total-intakes of vitaminsB-6 and B12 are protective of major depression in community-based older adults; however, there is little evidence from population-based studies on older adults to confirm this idea. This study uses a sample of 3503 older adults from the Illinois Health and Agaging project to investigate whether dietary habits of vitamins B6, folate or hocystein were associated with depressive conditions over an average age of 7.2 years. A group of 732 elderly people was followed over 2 -3 years for incident depression. These subjects had lower concentrations of folic acid, vitamin B 12, and folate as predictors of depressive disease. They also examined the association between folate blood levels and measures of affective function. Both men and women had low concentrationsof folate than those who did not take multivitamins.

Atrial fibrillation symptoms relate to low quality of life in female patients ; in fact , atrial fibrillation paroxysm usually presents higher heart rate , leading to preferentially adopt a rate rather than a rhythm-control strategy .
Female atrial fibrillation patients present an increased risk of stroke , worsened by the lower  oral anticoagulant prescription rate related to the concomitant higher haemorrhagic risk profile .
Trans-catheter ablation is under-used in female patients and , on the contrary , they are more commonly affected by anti-arrhythmic drug side effects","In this study, the risk of a pacemaker being inserted into a patient's atrial fibrillation is examined. Amiodraone use is associated with an increase in the need for speedmaker insertion; it is modified by weight and body mass index. Women have worse physical health and functional capacity than men, but they also have more frequent and serious cardiac symptoms. The relative risk of stroke differs widely among patients who receive aspirin or warfarin. A recent study suggests that warfaran reduces the rate of stroke in people with atrial Fibrilation but increases their risk of major bleeding. Warfarn therapy appears to be effective in women, if less so than in men. Women are more likely to develop acute success rates and complications than men. They also have higher risk of anticoagulating-related bleeding. Women experience more overall bleeding than men because warfarine is associated With more overall blood in both genderStudiy 1: Atrial fibrillations are a strong risk factor for Stroke. There is no evidence that women may be at greater risk for stroke than men due to their older age and increased risk of comorbid heart disease.

Resin‐based endodontic surgery with the use of high‐magnification preparation of a shallow concave root‐end cavity with bonded resin‐based root‐end filling material performed less favorably than EMS","In this study, the results of a large number of teeth treated after 5 years are compared to that of two different root-ending filling materials. The results indicate that the material is more successful than the other material in terms of overall healing rate. Apical surgery has been used frequently for patients who have failed conventional treatment. However, recent studies have shown that there is no difference in the success rate between the two methods. This study uses endoscopies to assess the effect of various factors on tooth healing. For example, preoperative factors such as the position and arch types may lead to greater success when comparing single-rooted healthy teeth with those with isolated lesions. Furthermore, it is possible that these factors may be related to the outcome of an isolated lesion. Thus, the present study examines the influence of several predictors upon the healing outcome following periapanical surgery. These include: pain at initial exam, size of the bone crypt, retrofillment material, and post-surgery course. It is concluded that the use of an endostoscopic device can aid in rootend management up to two years after surgery.",0.9931095499516945

Women who do not frequently consume walnuts are also associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 disease. We conclude that higher nuts have a protective effect on both blood lipid and body weight because they improve insulin sensitivity. A diet rich in fat but low in carbohydrates has been shown to be effective in improving many modifiably important cardiovascular risk factors.

Conclusion Basal hormone levels are not good predictor but blunted ACTH and GH responses to stimulation tests may be good predictors of OTS/FOR/NFOR","In this study, sixteen experienced male triathloners were divided into two groups: the intensified group and the normal group. The intensity group completed greater physical training loads than the usual group during the overreaching period; however, after four weeks of intense training, the subjects regained their ability to run at an increased speed. They also improved their free testosterone tocortisol concentration and hemoglobin ratio. This suggests that there may be some early indication of overreach in experienced triathletes who have been trained for long periods of time. Overreaching is particularly common in elite sport players because they are frequently overexerted by high-intensity bouts of vigorous exercise. These studies provide evidence that ""non-functional overreaching"" can be detected in young elite sports players. A case-control trial is performed using a field test to determine whether performance changes occur when overtraining is overreaches. Twenty-four youth elite soccer players showed significant performance decreases from season to season.

After two years, the results show that either reduced or increased physical activities were associated with significant declines in percent overbody and bodyfat and improved aerobic exercise. This paper also describes the effects of ""Plane Health"" on overweight and obesity among African American girls in grades 6 to 8 who have been educated in public schools. A culturely tailored afterschool dance and screens time reduction intervention does not significantly reduce waist circumference but produces potentially clinically important changes in lipid level, hyperinsulineemia, and depressed symptoms. Another observational study finds an association between watching and child and adult adodyposity. Although there is no clear relationship between these two behaviors, studies have found that they may be useful in preventing childhood obesity. One such study uses a multi-dimensional lifestyle intervention to prevent excessive weight gain in English children. Children spend more time watching TV than their parents do; however, neither group shows any difference in food consumption nor in physical activity. Two further studies examine the efficability of a new health education intervention called ""Helping H and"" -- which emphasizes self-representation and control over diet and activity -- in improving physical activity and BMI among young children. These studies suggest that primary care practices may be suitable for increasing physical activity but that long-term efforts must be made to improve health behavior among children.",0.9838393504837832

Compared with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass , adjustable gastric b and ing has lower weight loss efficacy , but also leads to fewer serious adverse effects","In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to weight loss in patients with severe morbid obesity. They describe two different approaches: laparoscopic adjustment gastric bribing and open-vertical ed gastroplasty. The first is performed on 80 patients who have been severely overweight for at least five years. The second is an open-ventilated procedure that involves a small pouch of tuberculosis. This new technique has much shorter post-surgery time and less complications than the other two methods. A prospective double blind study compares the effects of both procedures on body weight, appetite, fasting, and post-precise blood grelin levels. Both procedures result in significant weight loss as well as improved quality of life. Although there are no deaths or complications during the follow-up period, these results suggest that the combined treatment may be more effective than the conventional surgical method.",0.2981988017279815

In this study, we investigate the effect of percutaneous perinal stimulation on patients with complete or insufficient spinal cord injury. We find that PESP induces an increase in the Icp and latent periods in healthy volunteers than those with NED. A further study is performed to confirm this effect. The efficacy results from sildenanafil in patients with severe or incomplete SCI. Sildendafil seems to be more effective in these patients because it produces higher levels of success during sexual activity, intercourse satisfaction, and improved quality of life. This suggests that Sildennafil may be useful in treating men with SCI-related injuries.",0.9848859816693396

The results suggest that aspirine causes a marginal increase in risk of major blood complications than control group treatment. A further study is performed to determine whether three lead electrodes can be used as a detection device for atrial fibrillation. This trial was conducted in two practice settings: one where patients were assigned to systematic screening or one where they were assigned only to obportunistic Pulse Taken With follow-up ECGs.

The American College of Athletics recommends 150-250 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week for overweight or obese adults to help prevent weight gain. However, there are no well-controlled trials that demonstrate the efficacy of any particular type of exercise. Women with a healthy body mass index at 16 years of age report their weight, height, health, and health behavior in six surveys from the Australian Longitsudinal Survey on Women's Heath between 1996 and 12 years. Only three things -- low alcohol, moderate/ high physical activity, having university degrees, and major illnesses -- were positively associated by maintaining a normal body mass. A total of 3,881 women reported their weight over the next 6 years; only three factors -- low drinking, moderate active activity, and blue collar occupation -- were negatively connected with maintaining ",0.5459114730247004

In the first experiment, half of the teeth have precoated braces and the other has regular braces bonded with Self-etching Adhesives. Shear bonds strength is directly measured from the patients' mouths after debonding. The results show that there are no significant differences between posterior and anterior teeth in both groups. A new device is used to measure bond strength invivo. For the second experiment, 24 patients were divided into four groups: one group had self-etcheding primer, another group had conventional braces, and the third group had standard braces. After 23 months, all the patients were assigned to the same doctor who performed the treatment. He was able to assess herar bond strength by using an in vitro test machine. This study compares shear bond forces recorded at three different levels: 1) for uncoated Bracket #1, 2) for self-etchating Primer #2, and 3) for conventionally etching Bracelet #3.

There is also consistent evidence that epidural analgesia with local anesthetics is associated with faster resolution of postoperative ileus after major abdominal surgery .
Again , this finding may also become irrelevant with the adoption of laparoscopic techniques and multimodal fast-track programs for abdominal surgery .
There is no current evidence that perineural analgesia , continuous wound catheters using local anesthetics , IV patient-controlled analgesia with opioids , or addition of multimodal systemic analgesics have any clinical ly significant beneficial effect on postoperative complications .
CONCLUSIONS : Overall , there is insufficient evidence to confirm or deny the ability of postoperative analgesic techniques to affect major postoperative mortality or morbidity .
This is primarily due to typically insufficient subject numbers to detect differences in currently low incidences of postoperative complications","In patients with multi-vessel ischemia, epidal analgesis is shown to improve blood flow in the affected region.

Tree nut intake  lowers total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , ApoB , and triglycerides .
The major determinant of cholesterol lowering appears to be nut dose rather than nut type .","In a crossover feeding trial, the effect of a Mediterranean type diet with walnuts replaces about 35 %) of energy from unsatisfied fat on total and lipophosphorylated cholesterol levels. The results suggest that nuts may reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering both total and low-Dcholesterol levels. A study in patients with moderately high blood pressure shows that pistachoos can improve their lipid profiles. After four weeks, there is a decrease to total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL ratios; however, no changes are seen in other fatty acid fractions or oxidation markers. Nut consumption also reduces blood pressure but does not increase body weight. Two studies have examined the effects of pecan's rich in moaning fat as an alternate to the ""step I"" diet in reducing serum lipid concentrations in healthy subjects. One study compares two diets: a step I diet consisting only of almonds and a low almond diet which contains only half of the food consumed; another study uses a combination of three different diets for men and women who have elevated blood cholesterol. Almond consumes significantly lowers all three of these diets except for the reduction of total andLDL cholesterol. This suggests that coconuts might be useful in preventing heart disease because they contain polyunstained fatty acids.",0.971545208845013

The PON1-enhancing effects of statins were robust in the sensitivity analyses and were independent of statin dose , treatment duration and changes in plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration .
CONCLUSION The increase of paraoxonase and arylesterase activities with statins is a pleiotropic lipid-independent clinical benefit that may partly explain the putative effects of statins in preventing cardiovascular outcomes","The British Heart Study, the Lipid Risk-Folk Trial, and the Coronary Primary prevention Trial all examined the relation between high-denity lipophosphoprotein cholesterol and risk of heart disease in men and women. In these studies, a one-mg/Dl increase was associated with an elevated risk of death in middle-aged men; in those studies, only the controls were included. A similar relationship was observed in four American studies: ""The Framingham Heath Study,"" ""Lipid Research Clinic's Prevalency Mortality follow-up Study,"" and ""Mother-age High-risk Men."" These studies reported that there was little difference in the relative risk of mortality from low-dension lipoprotein levels as compared to other studies.

After four years, the gains are greater than those gained by the other two regimens. A comparison is made between the growth response of preparationubertal patients who received 0.3 mg per day or three times every week over four years. The annual growth velocity increases significantly in the first group, but the gain at age 4 is not as significant as it was in the second group. This results in an increase in height score for boys after puberty. Children with newly diagnosed Crohn disease receive normal laboratory results from 18 US/CANadian centers. There is no clear association among Crohn diseases severity and number of abnormal lab values. However, there were indirect correlations between inflammation and the extent of blood pressure. Although long-term rhG treatment has been used to treat young children with ill-formed bowel disease, studies have shown that it does not affect final height. Short-term treatments have demonstrated rapid growth rate following administering r-haGH to short children.

We find that patients with elevated blood pressure respond better to these doses than those with lower levels. This suggests that vitamin D may help prevent hypertension and improve health in patients with low 25 OH-D levels. The results suggest that even men with high 25 hydovin D levels are at increased risk of coronarion heart disease. Furthermore, studies have shown that people with higher 25  H-D concentrations are at greater risk of developing myocardiac infatriate ion because of their family history of cardiovascular disease.

The results indicate that there is little difference in failure modes between the two materials. In this study, the effects of a single power source of electricity are examined for bond strength as well as the effect of various surface treatment methods. Alumina-coated specimens show greater bond strength than those treated with other surface treatments.

Purpose: To compare theexpression of the seven recognized P1X receptors from male patients without detrusome instability caused by an obstructing bladder outlet. Using a quantitative Reverse TranscriptionPolymerase Chain reaction, we measure the membrane potential and electrical characteristics of cell isolated from suburotheal layers of the bladder. Parameters and Methods The cells are described as having a small membrane potential but have spontaneous spikes and randoments. Conclusions These cells seem to act as an ""electronic network.""",0.015743056276742037

None study assessed the long-term adhesive effectiveness to sound or demineralized enamel .
Although the articles included in this meta- analysis showed high heterogeneity and high risk of bias , the in vitro literature suggests superior performance of etch- and -rinse adhesives in primary teeth in comparison with self-etch systems","This study focuses on the effect of using casein-phosphopeptide Amorphous Calcium Phophate on tooth bond strength. The aim is to compare shear bonding strength of different types of adhesives against primary and permanent caries affected teeth. In this paper, the effects of Cpp-ACP are investigated. Types include: Tetric NBond, Adhesives One F, single Bond 2, Se Bond, and AdPer PromptL-Pop. Results show no significant difference in herar bond strength among primary or permanent groups. However, modes of failure were mainly adhesive system. All groups showed similar results except for CPP-acp.

Conclusion : Few high quality studies were found that examined the effects of interventions in the office on musculoskeletal or visual health","In this study, a group of office workers is assigned to an ""eccentric"" intervention group that includes assessment andmodification of workstation and stretching exercises or a combination of the two groups. The results are quite similar in terms of pain, symptoms, and general health. However, both groups experience significant reductions in pain from pre-to-post measures with improvements continuing for 12 months after baseline. This suggests that the additional job stress management aspect does not significantly increase the short-term improvements made about by the Ergorest alone. A prospective study of new hires examines the effects of rest breaks on neck or shoulder pain, eyestrain, mood, and performance. Two rest breaks schedules are compared; one contains 15 minutes per hour during the first part of the shift while the other contains 20 extra minutes. All subjects report improvement in pain, discomfort, and physical examination at the end of the week. More than fifty percent of new hired workers report their symptoms during the initial year after starting another new job. They also report improved recovery from complaints. An epidemiological field trial has been carried out over a two-year period.

The biggest effect of exercise intervention , of any type , has been seen on physical performance ( gait speed , chair rising test , balance , SPPB test , etc . )
.
We observed huge variations in regard to the dietary supplementation protocol s. Based on the included studies , mainly performed on well-nourished subjects , the interactive effect of dietary supplementation on muscle function appears limited","In this paper, the effects of prolonged resistance-style exercise training on older adults are compared. The results indicate that one-year strength increases by 45 p. m. in the placebo or protein group, while no significant differences were seen between groups. Type II muscles mass and strength increase over time in either group; however, there was no significant change in muscle fiber size. A high-intentioned functional exercise program improved balance, gaitability, and lowerlimb strength in elderly men who were dependent in daily living, living in residence care facilities, and with an M.M.S. score of 105. This study is designed to determine whether a high intensity functional exercise regimen improves balance, Gait ability, and reduced leg strength in older people who are dependent in everyday activities of daily life. An intake for protein-enriched fuel immediately after the studies does not seem to increase the effect of the training. Two studies have been published: one using leucine as a replacement for resistance training and another using a placebo control group. These studies aim to assess the effusiveness of two different forms of resistance training -- leuine alone or with a mixture of leutine and other ingredients -- on body composition during long-term resistance training.

Conclusions The MCID in acute pain varied greatly between studies and was influenced by baseline pain , definitions of improved patients and study design .","In this paper, Anderson focuses on the relationship between the visual anologue scale and the verbally numerical rating scale, VNRS, in patients with severe acute pain. He compares these two scales to other measures of pain that are commonly used in the ed setting. He concludes that VAS is more useful than VNRR because it can be used over time as a gauge of pain intensity. This paper also discusses the use of the Numerical Measure for measuring pain intensity by comparing raw pain intensity to a Pain relief Verbal Response Score. The difference in pain severity is significant; however, when the percent change is used instead of raw pain intensity, the patient's pain becomes more consistently worse.",0.9921501337936284

The magnitude of the reduction in HF exceeded the increase in stroke .
The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the primary outcomes","In this study, the effects of atenolal on left valsaran-based left ventricular maltrophy are investigated. The results suggest that treatment with a high-risk antihytensive agent reduces the risk of heart failure in patients with elevated left vsectoral mass. A comparison of these two treatments is made in three studies: 1) Antihypertinesive and Long-Term Lipid-Wounding Treatment for Prevent Heartattack Trial; 2) Antihypersive and Lid-Loowinging Treatment to prevent Heart attack Trial; and 3) New-onset Heart Failure Trial. These studies indicate that chlorthalidene or amlofdipine may be more effective than either regimen in reducing new-onset heart failure. Two other studies examine the effect of long- term angiotensol-converting enzyme blocker on blood pressure reduction in patients who have essential hypertension. They show that both regimens lead to reduced strokes but that they do not result in significant changes in left velocity. This paper also discusses the use of angiostensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in older subjects as well as those with newly diagnosed diabetes.

The results indicate that feeding to extremely high birth weight prevents necrotizing Enterocolitis or late-onset Sepsis. However, there is no evidence for any benefit from these regimens in this population. A trial was conducted on preterm infant girls with a gestational height between 23 and 30, within 48 hours of birth. This trial was designed to test the effects of using BBG-000 as an enteral feeding regimen. It showed that babies were more likely to develop Necrotising EnteroColitis than controls when they were given only probiotic treatment.

They show that there are significant differences between conventional and MRI methods for detecting early bone erosions. In addition, they suggest that dynamic contrast-enedecho-enhaged mristocratic resorptions may be associated with these changes. Conclusions That conventional approaches do not provide sufficient information for early injury, however, we recommend using a new technique called ""MRI"" to detect early joint destruction in patients with late rhematoidic arthritis.

Several mechanisms related to physicochemical properties of fibers such as solubility , fermentability and viscosity rates can be involved in their anti-obesity effects .
Dextrin , Mannan ( gum Arabic ) and pectin-rich fiber ( lupin kernel ) with no dietary interventions indicated a reduction in body weight and energy intake , while from clinical point of view , their effects were not considerable .
Overall , findings indicated that the efficacy of fiber supplements on obesity management is dependent on their contents and physicochemical properties .
It seems that fiber supplements with no weight-loss interventions did not have considerable antiobesity effects .","In this study, we examine the association between consumption of white rice and risk factors for heart disease. We conclude that whole grain consumption does not have any significant effect on reducing these risk factors. A cross sectional study is performed to assess the relationship between white rice consume and risk factor of cardiovascular diseases. The results indicate that there is no significant association amongst white rice consumption with risk factors of Cardio diseases. Further studies are required to demonstrate the contribution of gut-microbial composition to modulation host metabolism by inulin type fructans. Prebiotics may also improve blood lipid levels; however, they do not lead to changes in intestinal microbial content. Thus, prebiotics can be used as a preventive measure against Type 2 diabetes. This study uses a double blind placebo-controlled crossover trial to evaluate the efficacy or safety of a high fiber diet containing either 25 g/D lupine kernel fiber or citrus fiber over six weeks. Both groups lose significantly more weight than control group after controlling for body weight loss. Fat content at 18 week was reduced but only a small increase in Glycemic Index.

Men lose more weight and demonstrate greater declines in their control than women or subjects in the ""cognitive behavior modification"" group. Several reasons for these results are considered: first, there is confusion regarding the benefits of applying relaxation training in diabetic mellitateus; second, stress management training does not seem to improve blood glucose levels in patients with N-in-dependent Type II; and third, some studies have suggested that relaxation training may be useful in treating depression. The present study examines the effect of progressive relaxationtraining on acute glucose disposition in type 2diabotic patients. It is found that both groups exhibit significant weight loss but no differences were evident between groups. A further study is performed to determine whether an eight-week program of self-management education can reduce the amount of fat eaten and increase physical activity levels in older adults with Type 2Diabetics. This study was followed by a pilot study designed to evaluate the efficaciousness of an eight week program of lifestyle education for patients with established Type 2 Diabetes. These patients were divided into four groups: a small instruction program, Education program of individual visit, Education course, and Behavioral program. All achieved reductions in total cholesterol, body weight, knowledge about disease, and medication requirements. There was no difference in overall improvement in terms of glycohemogloin values over three time intervals.

He concludes that patient satisfaction is related to quality of care but that it does not relate to pain after three months. A further study is performed in which workers suffering from back pain are randomized to one of four groups: usual care, clinical intervention, occupational intervention or full intervention. The results indicate that the full intervention group returns to work faster than the conventional treatment group. Back school is more effective for patients who have been absent due to back pain for longer than six weeks. However, they do not show any reduction in the amount of time required to return to normal work. Another study is conducted in which patients with acute back pain receive an early intervention and then return to work within one year. It is found that there is no significant difference in the number of days of sickness leave during the second half of the year between the first two groups.

The most common source of income for these people is their long-term illness. Most people on long terms sick leave do not return to work after 13 years. However, there are several possible reasons for this finding: they may have had a mental disorder that led to long-stuff and ing difficulty on the labor marketplace; or they might have died during their follow-up periods. These patients were more likely to be back in employment after 12 years than before. This study was designed to examine the effect of weight reduction on health-regarding quality of life in subjects with severely obesity. After gastric bypass, changes in weight, comorbidity, and cardiovascular risk were evaluated 5 years after Gastric bypass. There were no significant differences in blood pressure, heart disease, or body mass index between the two groups.

The results are highly correlated with that of older adults. A comparison is made between weight and height to determine whether composition of old muscles affects muscle strength. This study also uses computed tommography to investigate the association between muscle attenupation values and muscle strength in stroke patients. It was found that lower values were associated with greater muscle architecture, muscle strength, and balance than those of younger people. Furthermore, it was concluded that whole body vibration does not improve leg strength or balance for stroke patients because there is no significant difference in the primary outcome of lowerlimb muscle architecture as a result of exercise alone. Stroke patients who had prior stroke were included in this study.

He discusses the use of the Consoli date-d St and Ards of Reportable Trials statement, which was first published in the early 1990s. The purpose of the statement is to improve the writing of reports of two- group, parallel studies. It has been used by many medical journals as well as editorial groups, including the ICMJ, the Vancouver Group, the Council Of Science Editors, and the world Association of Medical Editers. Since its initial publication in the mid-1890s, the Consolr statement has been adopted by several international groups of physicians, statisticians, epidemiologists, and other biomedical editors. Although some items are not considered essential for reporting simple two-collapsing trials, others may be highly desirable. At the end of May 2000, the group revizes the original statement with changes that focus on more important issues such as approval of an Institutional ethical review board, sources of funds for the trial, and registry number. This process makes the statement a constantly evolving instrument. After the group meets again in May 1999, they revise their original statement. They also discuss the benefits of creating an explanation and Elaboration document to help promote the use and dissuade readers from reporting biased or poorly described results.",0.9416900025605297

They were divided into two groups: one group received 200mg/resverarol and the other group received 100mg curcumin. Both groups showed no significant differences in liver fat contents between the two groups. For overweight and slightly obesity subjects, a single daily intake of 300mg of reversveratrol improves fasting blood pressure but does not affect histological characteristics.

While both approaches have a comparable effect on the overall AF diagnosis rate , the cost of systematic screening is significantly more than that of opportunistic screening from the perspective of the health service provider .","In this study, we aim to determine the frequency and severity of atrial fillation in patients aged older than 50 years. We compared the detection rates of new cases with that of routine practice. The detection rate was 1.63 percent a year for the intervention practice and 1.04 percent for the control practice. This is an improvement over the previous two studies. It also indicates that there are more cases of atrium fillations per year in the intervening practice than in the control group. A further study is presented on the use of electrocardiography as a risk stratification method for stroke in elderly people. These studies include: Heart failure and Stroke are major cause of Morbidity and Mortality in older people; Angiotension converting enzyme inhibits improve symptoms but survival in left-ventricular sychotic dysfunction; Anticoagulant is effective in stroke preventment in atrial Fiillation with Aspirin being less effective alternative. Atrial Fillation is regarded as an independent risk factor because it provides 'a five-fifth increase in risk'. Therefore, these studies aim to identify the prevalence and the epidemic of attrifusion in different age groups. They compare the accuracy of General practitioners, practice nurses, interpretative software, and electrodes used to detect atrial fibers.

Results of this meta- analysis of RCTs suggest a significant elevation in plasma cortisol levels following statin therapy","In this study, we examine the efficacy of sim vastatin in patients with familial cholesterol disease. After four weeks of treatment, there is no evidence of reduction in exercise capacity or cortisole or catechoamine responses. Lovastain is generally safe and tolerated. The results indicate that it is effective at reducing lipoprotein levels by 23 to 27 %) and total cholesterol by 18 to 20 %. There are no significant changes in vital signs, blood pressure and Pulse rate. However, growth and sexual maturity do not differ between the two groups. A further study is needed to investigate the effects of stress on mood during posttraumatic stress disorders. This study compares prava statin 40 mg daily with placebo in healthy men who have hypercholestemia. It shows that pravastin reduces the concentrations of both steroid and gonadotrophins. Five years later, however, death from myocardiaal infarction or non-fatal heart disease is reduced in the statin group. Over the follow-up periods, the risk for death from coronarry heart disease or other causes is reduced. For example, after 5 years, the combined risk of death was reduced from 7 to 5.5 percent. Furthermore, over the following 10 years, mortality from any cause was reduced as well. Conclusions In this analysis, 5 years' treatment with privastatin were associated with an increase in the risk of deaths from coronary chest disease or non fatal Myocardial Ion.

It was found that conversion to sinusrhythm occurred within an hour after the final dose of  Ibutilicide. Acute atrium fibrillation, also known as atrial  Flutter, is a common disorder among the emergency department patient population. Although there has been no recent studies reporting on the safety of such treatments, we do report that it appears to be safe during the first three months of the study. In contrast, long-term consequences are seen in many patients who undergo direct-current heartbeats. This practice guideline reduces the rate of admission from 74 percent to 38 percent.

In addition, there is no significant difference in the rate of lesions in the two groups at follow-up. A further study suggests that an intense physical exercise program can improve quality oflife in patients who have been treated for acute myotomy.

CONCLUSIONS Multifaceted professional interventions and organizational interventions that facilitate structured and regular review of patients were effective in improving the process of care .
The addition of patient education to these interventions and the enhancement of the role of nurses in diabetes care led to improvements in patient outcomes and the process of care","The aim of this study is to determine whether the use of practice-based education improves quality of care for inner city patients with Type 2 diabetes. This paper focuses on two specific areas: 1) localized, disease-specific prompting and 2) patient-centered care. In these articles, we describe how each practice receives one set of instructions but provide evidence on the managementof both conditions. We also present a new approach to treating patients with Diabetes Mellitus that involves using a problem-based Learning technique to implement an American Diabetes Association guideline. A control trial was conducted at two outpatient centers to study the effect of using ""the problem-base learning technique"" to adopt a diabetes medical practice guideline; however, after 15 months no significant differences in outcome were found between groups in Metabolic controls, psychological status, knowledge of treatment, satisfaction with treatments, disruption of usual activities, numbers of visits and admissions, frequency of blood glucose estimation, and cost to patients. Two studies have been published regarding the effectiveness of centrally organized prompting for managing adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetics. These studies are divided into four sections: 1) An evaluation of integrated care as opposed to conventional hospital care; 2) A cluster visit model lead by a doctor's nurse for deliveringoutpatient care managed to adult patients without poor gycemic control; 3) A group of interventional regimens for patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitateus; and 4) A demonstration of improved physician compliance with decision support systems from a practiceguideline.",0.9895604985824592
17846060,Some of the risk factors for anticoagulation-related bleeding are also indications for the use of anticoagulants in AF patients .,"In this study, the rate of major and minor bleeding in patients treated with warfari is compared to that of those treated with less intense antithrombotics. Major bleeding occurs more frequently in older patients who receive adjusted dose warfarin as opposed to regimens of less intense treatment. The risk for major bleeding increases rapidly when age is not present. A large cohort of elderly patients with intermittent atrial fibrillation has shown no increase in stroke rates over the period from 1976-1988. This study uses a prospective cohort of 19,698 Danish adults aged 35-64 years old and follows them for two years during which time they have an annual stroke rate of 7.8% per year. Although there are some differences in the frequency of stroke among different age groups, it is clear that these patients do not experience any significant changes in their health afterward. Stroketic events vary widely among patients with hemorrhaged atrial fibrilation. These include: frequent consumption of alcohol; early pregnancy; high blood pressure above 160 mmHg; and prior stroke/transient ischemia. Age-specific risk factors were determined by multivariable logistic regression analysis. There was little association between age or severity of disease. However, several studies reported on the relative risk associated with major bleeding in people with atrial Fibrilation. Hemorring rates rose with age. Warfaris increased the risk of severe major bleeding but did not result in major bleeding. Conclusions That older age increases the risks of major bleeding, particularly Intracernial hemorburhage, in patients receiving atrial fiber therapy. Older age also increases the risk because of greater number of prescribed medication. Prominence Within this group of patients, patients with atrium fibrillation can be reliablyed identifiedStudies 1:BACKGROUNT AND PURPOSO The risk of primary events is 2.2 %) per year in the firstyear and is about 5 % thereafter. Disabling strokes range from 2 p.m. to 15 pp. Per year in those with non-reheumatic Atrial Fibillation. Oral Anticoagulants are the most effective method of stroke prevention in cases with atary fibrillations.

26501062,"In the first systematic review , the patients ' or HCPs ' overall judgment about the likely evolution of LBP was the factor most strongly linked to poor outcome , with predictive validity similar to that of multidimensional scales .
This result may be explained by the implicit aggregation of many prognostic factors underlying this judgment and suggests the relevance of considering the patients from biopsychosocial and longitudinal points of view .
It is unlikely that any intervention focusing on a single factor would ever fit the needs of most patients ; interventions targeting determinants from several fields ( mainly psychosocial , biomechanical , and occupational ) may be more relevant .
Finally , in the third study , the prevalence of psychosocial comorbidity in chronic LBP patients was not found to be significantly higher than in other patients consulting in primary care .
Rather than specifically screening for psychosocial conditions , this suggests taking into account any potential comorbidity in patients with chronic LBP , as in other patients .
As this condition is illustrative of many situations encountered in primary care , the strategies proposed here may benefit most patients consulting in this setting","In this study, a grouping of general practitioners is used to predict whether patients with unfavorable low back pain will show any improvement over the course of their follow-up. The outcome is that patients have no clinically important improvement after six, 13, 26 and 52 weeks. A third of patients show an un favorable course of lowback pain on follow up. This prediction rule includes history of low Back Pain, self-preceived Risk to develop chronic Low Back Pain; no solicitous response of the patient's partner, frequent Walking at work, and ""paincatastrophizing"".

30293906,"EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS The most studied combination therapy for the treatment of male LUTS is the α1-adrenoceptor antagonist/5α-reductase inhibitor combination .
This combination seems to be more efficacious in terms of several outcome variables , in particular in men who have moderate-to-severe LUTS and are at risk of disease progression .
Also in terms of nocturia improvements , this combination is significantly more effective than the monotherapy .
The other often studied combination treatment , in both male and female patients with LUTS , was the combination of antimuscarinics ( in particular solifenacin ) and mirabegron .
This combination seems to be more effective in comparison with the monotherapies with respect to urinary incontinence and urgency urinary incontinence episodes and several other objective and subjective parameters , without relevant increase of adverse events .
The combination of hormone therapy and antimuscarinics in women with LUTS does not seem to be useful .
For the treatment of LUTS in men and women , combination therapy appears to be a promising option to optimize the efficacy of the available drugs for those who do not experience sufficient benefit with monotherapy .
This add-on scenario offers the possibility to have a more tailored approach to the management of LUTS , always seeking the optimal balance between efficacy and tolerability for a given patient .

32149404,"Perioperative risk factors were inconsistently associated with developmental outcomes .
INTERPRETATION The literature on children undergoing surgery in early infancy suggests that infants with a single ventricle are at highest risk of adverse developmental outcomes .
WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS Children with complex congenital heart disease ( CHD ) are at increased risk of impaired developmental outcome .
Children with single-ventricle CHD have worse outcomes than children with two-ventricle CHD .
Children with two-ventricle CHD gradually grow out of their initial developmental impairment .
Perioperative factors are inconsistently associated with outcome","Children surviving early congenital chest surgery are assigned to either low-flow or deep hypothermy circulatory arrest. The results of the study indicate that children with only one type of heart surgery have worse motor and language skills than those with multiple types of heart defects. In addition, patients with high blood concentrations tend to have more severe seizures at the age they undergo open heart surgery. A comparison of two different methods of support for infants with great arteries is made in this paper. Infants who undergo an arterial switch procedure receive lower scores on their performance on tests of gross motor function and fine motor function but also have greater severity of speech abnormalities during the periodic period. This suggests that higher glucose concentrations may not be associated with better neurodemoralal outcomes. Long-lived follow-up studies are necessary to determine whether test scores of children after conventital heart disease can predict future behavior. Brain magnetic recoil assessment is used to assess brain development in infants transposed by the great artery. Although most 1 year old test scores are significantly associated with 2 years of school age, many children do not have good late outcome. Short-term follow up studies are required to draw infers about the long- term effects of pre-operative intervention and post-surgery factors. Heart surgery performed without circulationatory arrest is associated with increased risks of delayed motor growth and neurologic disturbances at 3 years of age. These studies suggest that some patients with univalence heart disease should be considered at risk for developing permanent hearing loss.",0.8397525135900867

Eight patients fulfill the diagnostic threshold for cerviogenic headache as defined by the IH standards. The results of the 45 patients are described in this paper. Cervicogenic symptoms appear to be relatively common among the general population. A single blinded observer assesses the validity of the Neck Flexibility test to detect subjects with headache caused by C1 dysfunction. Two experienced examinerers evaluate the test in 10 symptomatic controls, 20 subjects without cervinogenic headache, and 10 subject with C1 but without C2 as the primary functional level.

Current evidence supports adjunctive use of SAMe , methylfolate , omega-3 , and vitamin D with antidepressants to reduce depressive symptoms","This paper focuses on the effects of B-vitamins on depression. It is shown that B vitamins do not increase the response to treatment over time, but that they improve and sustain antidepressedant response over one year. In other words, it's better than placebo for treating major depression. A double blinded trial of patients aged 70 years or older who are assigned to receive 1,000 IU of vitamin D every autumn and winter for three years. The results show that there's no significant difference in blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamine D between the two groupings. There's also no association between serum-25-hydroxyvitamine D levels and mood. Brain Snack: Many studies have found that omega-3 phosphorus has been implicated in depression. Some suggest that this may be due to increased inflammation. Another study suggests that adding folic Acid to an antidepressive regimen can help reduce symptoms in patients with Major Depressive disorder. These studies include a doubleblind, placebo-control trial of people with major depressant disorder. They find that the addition of either EPA or FOLAC acid leads to improved scores on Hamilton Rating scale for depression.

21276215,The overall outcome of the computed data sets suggest no difference between the caries-preventive effects of GIC- and resin-based fissure sealants .,"In this paper, the authors present a revised version of the Consolor statement that improves the reporting of controlled trials. The original statement was originally published in the American College of Physicians' Guideline for reporting trial results and is now included in the new edition of the Consoli date-d St and Ards of reporting trials. A survival analysis of hundred meta-analyseses indexed in an ACP Journal club from 1995 to December 2005 found that changes in evidence were frequently and within short time periods. These studies have become increasingly popular in recent years; however, few empirical evidence guide this or any other recommendation about updating systematic reviews. To determine how quickly these reviews meet explicitly defined thresholds for changes in efficacy or harm, we first examine the frequency of updates by using a method similar to those used in previous reviews. We also use fixed-effect methods to detect potential change in evidence which would warrant reassessment. Qualiitative signals consist of ""new information about harmsufficient to affect patient decision making"" and ""important caveats,"" as well as important changes in uncertainty or direction of action. This approach allows us to identify signaling differences in effectiveness between treatments but does not allow us to predict whether they will be effective or not.",0.9882958851311457

Clinical significance Based on the results of this study , the bulk-fill resin composites could be an alternative for direct restorations in posterior teeth .","In this paper, we examine the evidence stemmating from trials on Restorative or Adhesive materials. Two authors assess design, risk of biased, and registry status; studies with high-impact factor / 2 are more likely to be registered than those with low risk of Biasiness. The majority of restorative treatments published from 2005-2015 have limited validity. Most trials used US Public Heath Service (USPHS) criteria, and had significant differences between group groups. A further study is presented that compares two different types of bulk-fill material for posterior restorations in single-surface cavities. This study uses a double blind approach to evaluate the performance of two different techniques for posterior restorations. One technique involves using an incrementally placed resin composite as a filling material while the other involves using a conventional bulk-filled material. After three years, the results show no significant differences among the two methods. Conclusions: Bulk-fill composites seem to exhibit similar clinical performance to incrementally place conventional composites.",0.003062717834438044

The current evidence does not suggest an important effect of tibolone or of SERMs alone or combined with estrogens on sexual function .","Tibolone, a low-dose of morphine, has been used to improve menopisal symptoms without altering endometrially thickness or blood glucose. In this study, we compare the efficaciousness and safety of two different forms of treatment: tibotone 1.25mg for 24 weeks; and titbolone 2.75mg over 24 weeks. Women with vaginala bleeding are less likely to experience such symptoms in either group. Menopause is common in older women but not well known. Postmenophausal Hormone therapy reduces frequent hot flusheses, trouble sleeping, and vainl dryness. However, when combined HRT was introduced into the system, it improved sexual function and health related life. A double blind trial was conducted in which 40 postmenopanal women aged 45-64 years were randomed to receive conjugated estrogen from 1862 to 1859. After one year, small but significant improvement were observed on three of nine parts of the women's health Question Observation. The female sexual function Index was modified by the addition of methyltestosteron. This results in improved sexual functions and quality of Life in both groups. Trials have not yet been reported regarding social and behavior changes in women receiving conventional hormonal replacement therapy. Two studies have been performed in which patients received progestinate plus medreoxyprogestesterone alone or placebo. These studies suggest that progestigenous estriol may be more effective than other anti-urogenital disease treatments. Progestin alone increases the risk of menopardy among continent women. Both regimens also increase the frequency of urinary tract infection. Estriol seems to shorten the period of Urogenital symptoms as well as relieve some of the pain caused by these symptoms. Urethral atrophy appears to be reduced after using local estriol. Estradiolil can help shorten time for urinary complaints. It does not seem to affect the response of biochemical marker for cardiovascular diseases. Estrogen only increases the severity of hotflues.

We find that there are several risk factors associated with falling, including reduced levels of activity, stroke, arthritis of knees, impairment of Gait, and increased muscle weakness. The most common risk factor for falls in older people is lack of physical activity. This suggests that exercise may be an effective way to prevent falls. A recent study shows that regular exercise improves balance, strength, and control in older adults.

They use a cut-off point as a measure of how much pain is tolerated by the treatment group and then compare it to the mean change on a scale that corresponds to the severity of pain in different patient groups. The results indicate that the amount of systemic anesthesia used during the postopatra procedure is not sufficient to control pain in patients who are receiving autograft. A double blinded study shows that continuous infusing bupivivacaine at the donor site does not improve pain control in patients with central pain.

Perioperatic cyclonoxase inhibitors show comparable analgesici efficacy than other surgical agents but have not yet been studied after elective cesaren delivery under spine anesthesia. This study uses a parallel-group design to determine the effect of cannabinol and cannanol on pain reduction after open thoscotomy. After surgery, ropinvacaine and lidocaines are added to perineural analgea; however, these two groups do not reduce the intensity of pain immediately after surgery.

22820555,"A review of its effects in schizophrenia suggests that modafinil facilitates cognitive functions , with pro-mnemonic effects and problem solving improvements .
The systematic review on the neurochemical modulation of the modafinil suggests that its mnemonic enhancing properties might be the result of glutamatergic and dopaminergic increased neuronal activation in the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex respectively .
Other neurotransmitters were also activated by modafinil in various limbic brain areas , suggesting that the drug acts on these brain regions to influence emotional responses .","In this paper, the authors describe a pilot study in which they assess the efficaciousness and safety of an eight-week regimen of modalfinil for patients with mild to moderate psychosis. They conclude that it is not possible to detect if any treatment effect occurs; however, larger trials need to be performed to determine whether or not a particular effect occurs. The first trial does not show any significant improvement in symptoms or behavior in patients receiving antipsychotic medicine. However, these studies are needed to clarify whether there is a potential mechanism for improving functional outcome in patients with severe mental illness. Modull, a sleep-promoting agent, has been used to improve attention, memory, learning, and executive functions in healthy volunteers as well as adults with attention deficit disorder. It has also been shown to increase performance on short- term memory span, visual memory, spatial planning, and stop signalal motor inhibition. This suggests that modufinil may act as a novel stimulant for improving neuropsychological tasks in healthy subjects. A double blinded randound, doubleblind placebo controlled crossover study was conducted using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to examine the benefits ofmodafinill on learning and nerve activity related to cognition in abstinenent, ma-dependent, and healthy controls. Modifinil improved certain aspects of brain function and positively improved participants' ability to attending post-night shift didactic sessions but did not improve sleepiness during night shifts. These studies suggest that modacull may have some beneficial effects on negative symptoms in diseases such as schizophrenia. Although no effect seems to be found on negative signs, adjunctive treatments with modafranl may result at least in general improvements in people with serious mental illnesses.",0.9966495668972642

The results indicate that Lactobacilus reduces the risk of Necrotic Enterocolitis in preterm premature infants. Preterm babies who receive probiotics have a lower incidence of Necterizing Enterocotis than those who receive no probiotic treatment. This is due to the fact that early colonization by beneficial bacteria has a protective effect on intestinal motility. A double blinded, placebo controlled trial was performed on 229 preterm infant girls weighing from 500 to 1499g at birth. The first outcome was the reduction of necrotating enterocoitis and the second was the decrease in the severity of Nescorts or death. Both groups had similar rates of mortality and were not associated with any adverse effects. Two studies were conducted: one concerning the use of Bfidophagium Lactis as a preventive measure against nosocomic infections; and another concerning the efficaciousness of probiotic regimens for preventing late-onset disease in very lowbirth-women. These studies showed that probiotic treatments did not significantly reduce the rate of infection but reduced the severity",0.796671445457417

The authors conclude that there is no evidence to support a clinically significant association between blood 25h H D levels and postmenopalausal symptoms. In this study, we examine the effects of vitamin D on vaginal growth and maturation in older women. We find that it has been shown that daily doses of 500mg of elemental calcium and 400 iu of vitamin C are sufficient to prevent bone loss from occurring in these women. A double blind, controlled trial was conducted in which 100 women were divided into three groups: the treatment group received 1,500mg each day; the control group received only one tablet per day. After two months, the number of superficial cells improved significantly as did the mean dryness and palatability at the endof the treatment.

26180255,CONCLUSIONS Supplementation with vitamin D showed no effect on adiposity measures in adults,"In this study, the effects of two different types of vitamin D regimens on hip bone loss in elderly women are compared. The first group is a fixed combination of calcium and Vitamin D; the second group is an active treatment with a higher dose of both. Both groups have similar changes in body mineral densities. A1c levels are slightly lower in the active treatment than in the control group. However, there is no difference in fasting blood pressure, 2-h sugar, or insulin secretsion as well as any development of diabetes. All three studies conclude that high-doses of vitaminD for one year affect either secretion, sensitivity, or the developing of Type 2 Diabetes. This study also confirms that low-dosed vitamin D does not lead to increased serum 25hydroxyvitamin C levels. Furthermore, patients with prediabtes and hypovitinosis do not experience elevated serum 25OHD levels. These results suggest that daily consumption of sufficient amounts of calcium can prevent excessive weight gain. Two studies examine the effect of long- term changes in physical activity and menopause. One investigates whether exercise increases body composition while the other investigates the association between height, weight, waist circumference, and percentage body fat. There is little difference in total body fat, but there is significant increase in parathyroid Hormone level. Another study compares the change in body mass Index and Body Fat Mass in healthy older adults. It is found that increasing BMI has been associated with the decrease in 25HhD after supplementation.

The results are similar: at 1 year, the LFD group loses more weight than the other two groups; at 6 months, they lose more weight and have better blood pressure. This is an important finding because it suggests that aim aiming for 20 pp of energy from carbohydrates may be safer than conventional approaches to weight loss.",0.7177693435003293

The results are similar to those of other statins; however, no significant changes are seen in these two groups. Simvastain is superior to placebo for reducing lipoprotein peroxidation in subjects with Type 2 diabetes. This trial was registered with National Council of Scholars ""Study 1, ""Ezetimibe:Simva Statin:Rosuv:Another Antioxidative Stress Marker in Type 2 Diabetes"". These studies aim to investigate whether or not simvasatiin can reduce elevated oxidative stresses in people suffering from Type 2 disease. We compare three different hypocholesterolic regimens that have been used to treat hypercholestemia: sim vastatin alone, 10-20 or 10/30 mg daily; ezetamibe/simvastatinate combined therapy; and a 12-month treatment with simvastin. All patients showed signs of deterioration in terms of Pon1 activity, endotolium function, and antioxidant activity. They were divided into four groups: control group, which consisteted of 30 healthy individuals; group I, which consisted of 20 normal subjects; and group II, which comprised 20 type 2 dialysis patients without heptomies. Acute coronary vasodelaxation improved by 33% after 1 day of statin administration. There was an increase in Pon1, activity and reduction in serum glutathone reductise activity as well as increased expression of prothrombbin fragment 1+2 levels.

The patients are divided into four groups, each with its own set of specific characteristics: pain scores, time to discharge, length of stay, and readiness for discharge. Both groups have similar lengths of hospital stay; however, they do not show any differences in their duration of recovery. Postoperative mortality is less than that of general anesia. In addition, there is no difference in blood loss during the first two weeks of operation. Acute plus convalescence is shorter in both groups. There is little difference in mental function after hip surgery under either group. No persistent improvement in mental performance occurs after acute hip surgeries under either type of treatment. However, it is important to note that this technique does not provide relief from major complications. Maternally hemodynamics are similar and acceptable as either surgical methods.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in the prevention of postoperative complications in appendectomised patients , whether the administration is given pre- , peri- or post-operatively , and could be considered for routine in emergency appendectomies","In this chapter, the authors present a detailed description of the methods used to treat children with acute and nonperforate appendiciitis. The first group receives no antibiotics; the second is given only one preoperative dose in order to prevent infection from developing. Appendectomy is followed by IV antibiotics until an abdominal infection resolves. A course of out-patient or out-of-patient antibiotics does nothing to reduce the frequency of infectious complications during appendicide surgery. Children are divided into two groups: those who receive either cefam or ole before appendicectomy and those who do not receive any prophylactic antimicrobials after appendication. After appepticitis has resolved, patients receive 7 days of either placebo or outpatient treatment. There is no difference in wound infection in both groups except for perforation. Woundirrigation with 1 percent cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide wasineffective inpreventing wound infection all grade ostificially. Wowd irrigation with 1 percent cetyll trimethyl ammonium bromide were ineffective in killing wound infection at all grade grades of appendicetis. When woundcontamination is difficult to avoided, as in Perforatedappendicitus, topicalampicillin should beused to reducethe rate of wound infections. This study attempts to determine whether single-dose regimens of metirondazole can significantly reduce the risk of Post-Appendicectomy Sepsis. Although reports suggest that antibiotic use should be reserved for suspected patients with more serious disease, we have suggested that prophylusical use of antibioticprophylaxises individually only in these patients with high risks of spidities after appendix. Prophylic treatment with cephalidine of patients under surgery for uncomplicated appendicatis resulted in reduction in the rates of postoperative wound infection. No sideeffects caused by the use of drugs were noted. Antibiotic prosphylaxes are reserved for certain indications because they cause considerable morbidness and prolong hospital stay.

The endoscopic technique has no significant effects on the postoperative inflammation. This study compares the two approaches to determine whether their anestry influences the severity of the wound healing process. Both methods have similar pain scores after the first day of operation. However, both procedures cause greater inflammatory responses than either approach.

In this study, we examine the relationship between drinking habitual coffee and risk of sudden physician-diagnosis of hypertension in a group of 105,594 United States women who have been free from physician diagnoses for 12 years. The results suggest that there may be a role for caffeination in improving weight status among children at different risk of obesity.

Children born at different risks for obesity were divided into seven categories: milk, fruit juice, fruit drinks,caloric and uncaloric soddies, soft drinksincluding and excluding fruits juice, and diet sweeteners. This study examined the effect of Artificial Sweetener on glucose, insulin, and Glycemic Pepte in humans. It was found that artificial sweetening improves glucose tolerance by increasing secretion of glutagon-likepeptide, an important peptide involved in fat deposition.

We performed a double-maskin trial of 61 patients to receive either cleaning the margins or using artificial tears without preparations. After 3 months, the mean Ocular SurfaceDisis Index, tear break Up Time, and meebum score presented improvement from their baseline values. In addition, they showed improvement in the severity of corneal frostbite staining after 3 months. Furthermore, topical anamira was safe and effective in treating dry eye diseases. Two trials were conducted on twenty-five patients who had been treated with MGD. They were assigned into two groups. One group received NAC 5 percent or a Topical Steroid Antibiotic combination, Betamethasone 10 % per day, topically four times daily for a week. Each group was instructed to use LipiFlow system which resulted in significantly improved tear film stability. These results supports its safety andeffectiveness in the treatmentof meibbingomian gloat and dysfunction.

Statistical models can provide a better underst and ing of the impact of these factors , allowing for the provision of more personalised physical activity programs , which are expected to produce better immediate and long-term outcomes for participants .","In this study, we examine the association between activity levels and body composition in a group of 167 women who have been walking for seven days. The results indicate that moderate-intentional walking is associated with lower body mass index, fat- free mass index as well as waist-hip proportions. We conclude that ""the concept of 10,000 Steps/Day appears to be strongest predictorof health-related bodies composition values"". This paper also discusses the use of physical activity consults in long-term walking studies. It shows that both groups successfully increase and maintained step count over 12 months. Two studies are presented: one on Walking for Wellbeying in the West and another on Physical Environment. These studies investigate the relationship between walk levels and neighborhood safety and how it affects self-regarding physical activity. They find no association between step counts and daytime safety among men and women but only when they feel unsafe at night. A third study uses a three-wave approach to assess the effect of an enhanced walking program on employees' participation rates. This study compares the impact of exercise mode, environment, and sequence on step counts or sitting time. It finds that there is no significant change in sitting time during the intervention period except for incidental walking. However, these studies do not show any significant changes in other health outcomes. Finally, the British Council for Review S and Disemination develops a register of systematic reviews which will serve as a central hub for information on all aspects of health.",0.3751899800115026

In addition to adverse effects in general population s , BZDs are associated with specific problems in patients with PTSD : worse overall severity , significantly increased risk of developing PTSD with use after recent trauma , worse psychotherapy outcomes , aggression , depression , and substance use .
The results of this systematic review suggest that BZDs should be considered relatively contraindicated for patients with PTSD or recent trauma .","In this study, the effects of short-term alprazolum treatment on a patient's recovery from posttraumatic stress is investigated. The effect of immediate alprasolam treatment was found to be effective in alleviateing anxiety at days 4 and 30; however, it was associated with greater freezing response after trauma cues. A further study investigates whether veterans with posttraumatic distress disorder may abuse psychiacs such as benzodyne or develop violent Dyscontrol when using these drugs. This study also examines the relationship between mental health and sleep disturbances in patients who have undergone severe mechanical ventilation. After four weeks, patients in both light and deep sedations were more likely to experience symptoms of PTSD than those in either group. These results suggest that ""light sedation"" affords benefits for reduction of intensity of ventilation without adverse effects on later patient mental health nor patient safety. Post-traumatic Stress Disorder has been identified among a significant number of patients following critical illnesses requiring mechanical venturing. Although there are no specific symptomatical effects on outcome of drug treatments in PTSD, studies suggest that altering the benzoxamine/Gabaa receptor complex in stressful and anxiety can lead to reduced response to acute exposure therapy.",0.2613672855636147

In the workplace an economic return on investment in a number of comprehensive workplace health promotion programmes and stress management projects ( largely in the USA ) was reported , while group-based exercise and psychosocial interventions are of potential benefit to older people .","The cost of a nine-month intervention in older adults with poor health is found to be relatively effective. Costs are lower for the intervention than for the passive control groups, and the quality of life Index shows a 4.6 percent QALY difference. In addition, the incremental cost effectiveness Ratio for preventive therapy compares favorably with the combined control: $ 10, 666; $ 7, 820. This study supports the argument that ""preventive"" occupational therapy can reduce medical expenditures by reducing social and economic burdens on common mental illnesses like depression. A workplace mental health program has been proposed to improve the health of smallmedium enterprises such as those operating in regions where there is no access to professional services. However, this does not appear to be an effective strategy because it involves developing workers' psychological capital through hope, selfefficacy, and optimism.

The results suggest that this program may serve as an addition to or replacement for conventional treatment. In two studies, we examine the relative benefits of family-centered psychoeducational and medication treatment for patients with unipolar depressive disorders. Both groups show significant improvements in symptoms but no differences in severity over time.

The study concludes that ""the infant'health status might be a greater prominent factor in explanation a mother's moresensitive behavior."" A federal law has recently been passed allowing for medically severe children to be evaluated by multiple disciplined methods. These services are especially important because many families have difficulty accessing community-based or coordinated early childhood education when they receive these services.

Walking aids , wheelchair characteristics and environmental hazards are significant environmental risk factors .
Falling is a common problem among young patients affected by neurological disorders , although the risk of falling for a specific individual is difficult to predict and the risk of a severe fall-related injury has not yet been established .
IMPLICATION S FOR REHABILITATION Young patients with impaired gait and balance or medium to severe motor disability appear to be at increased risk of falling .
Patients who are relatively independent and still participating in challenging activities have an increased exposure to fall-risk .
Walking aids , wheelchair characteristics and environmental hazards are significant environmental risk factors .","In this study, we examine the changes in functional abilities and falls of subjects with a spinal cord injury six months after their discharge. Forty four subjects experienced one or more medical complications during their stay at Thail Hospital. The subjects had a significant decline in their ability to function after recovery. Elderly patients with an intact spinal cord are more likely to fall than those who have no history of injuries. This paper describes a case control study of falls on a neurorehabilitatory unit at the hospital. It was found that there were only 117 falls reported during the nursing office during the study time. Most common diagnoses treat on the unit include traumatic spinal Cord injury, brain injury, and multiple Sclerosis. Falls represented72 percent of all incidents reports made tothe nursing officeDuring the study period, falls represented 92 patients during the time when the population census was 28621 patient days; yielding 1, 439 falls per1,000 patient years. One hundred sixteen falls occurred in fifty-eight persons during the previous year. Fallers differ significantly regarding escorted disability status score, spastiity, propriokception, and use of walk aids. These findings suggest that people with multiple diseases need to be closelymonished for future falls. Next step will be to investigate the relation between executive functions and measure of gait/balance in elderly people with incomplete spine cord injury. A cross sectional mail survey was sent to 221 adults with incomplete spinalcord injury from a large specialist hospital in the southeast United States. Of these individuals, 553 fell events and 171 were injured as result of falls. A logistically predicted wheelchair fall was associated with pain in previous two months, alcohol abuse, greater motor functio, history of past fall, fewerSCI years, and shorter distance of wheelchair. All factors were explained by these risk factors. Finally, the Berg balance scale showed good performance but was not highly predictive of falling. Furthermore, it was poorly suited to predict accidental falls.",0.289342252446206

Patients who were very vitamin D deficient and those not receiving bolus doses experienced the most benefit .","In this study, the effects of high dose vitamin D on patients with severe obstrutive pulmonary disease are investigated. The results suggest that higher doses of daily supplementation may be more effective in preventing exacerbitations than improving quality of life. A post-hoc analysis shows that those with severe deficiencies at baseline do not have a significant effect on time to first infection or severity of cold symptoms. However, studies indicate that increased levels of 25HhD increase the risk of acute respiratory infections in children with low birth weight. These studies furthermore suggest that increasing 25 HhD levels may reduce the frequency and severity of outbreaks of influenza in Mongolian children. This is supported by a double blinded rand omize controlled trial wherein over 200 Mongolian schoolkids were assigned to different treatment regimens in winter. The primary end result was an infectious Score based on Five Parameters: symptoms from Respiratory Tract, ears And Sines ; malaise and Antimicrobial Consumption. Results were significantly reduced for subjects assigned to the vitamin E group compared against the placebo group. Furthermore, infants receiving high-dose Vitamin D had a lower rate of falls and bruises during the follow-up period. Conclusive conclusions support these findings as well as others.

We find that mild and heavy abuse are more likely to lead to first symptoms than moderate or heavy abuse. This suggests that there may be a risk of early relapse among these patients. Relapse has been used as a measure of severity in schizophrenia but it has not been used for long. A population-based cohort study is performed in Germany to determine whether change in drug use affects patient's symptoms and function. The results suggest that changes in substance use are associated with worse outcome in people with established mental illness. However, studies have found no evidence of an effect on the earlier occurrence of psychotic disease. Furthermore, continued use increases the risk of developing persistent symptoms. To further investigate the association Between Cannabis Use and Clinical Outcome, we perform a large-scale prospective observational study of over a hundred and sixty patients who were treated at a VA hospital. Our aim was to compare the effects of acute cannabis use on verbal performance during verbal learning tasks. Results showed that increased doses of alcohol were associated with greater depression and anxiety; however, they did not predict improvement in patient functioning.

Overall , ( motor-coordinative ) intervention studies seem to be more promising than cross-sectional studies","In this study, we examine whether a one-year exercise program for older adults will improve the concentration of brain growth factors. We find that younger people perform better and have greater learning in comparison to older subjects. A second study is designed to extend previous studies by examining changes in motor performance, motor learning, andalpha activity as functions of age and health. This study compares two groups of older adults with different levels of fitness. Younger participants perform better than older subjects; however, fitness does not impact either performance nor learning. The results suggest that learning occurred. Age-related decline in motor function was hypothesized because physical fitness may also attenuates this decline through it's impact on the brain. Brain-derived nerve factor, bdnf, IGF1, and vavinothelially growth factor are associated with improvements in functional connectivity after exercise. Older men perform better but have greater Learning than younger men. Alpha power is related to motor sequence learning.

It was a well-planned trial that showed significant reductions in primary endpoint events as well as stroke morbidities and mortality. Although not set out an effect on overall mortality, we noted a greatly reduced number of death in the active group. We concluded that treatment in elderly patients aged 70-84 years confer highly significant and ""clinically relevant reductions"" in both blood pressure and total mortality. This paper discusses the latest developments in the field of hypertension management.

The results showed that infants in the controls group had more frequent fever episodes than those in the other groups. Children with either of these groups also had shorter bouts of diarrhea but no change in behavior because of disease. This is due to the fact that they are not breastfed.

28459121,"Conclusions The Timed Up- and -Go test measure appears not to be a useful measure of physical functioning for the driving outcomes included here .
The Rapid Pace Walk may be useful in studies of driving ability and exposure .","In this study, we examine the physical and mental abilities of 1,650 older adults as potential predictors that they will stop driving over a five-year period. The results suggest that older age, congesive heart failure, poorer physical function, and slower speed of execution are risk factors for stopping driving. A summary performance test is used as an indication of independent living in older adults; it has excellent reliability but is sensitive to change. This study uses the Short Physical Perception Battery to predict future hospitalization, relapse, and death among older patients who have had a stroke, congetive heart failure or minor fracture. Older patients with poor scores at discharge also have greater risk of dying than those with better scores. These studies need further research to determine whether drivers' performance can be improved by exercise. We present a community-based population-based cohort which includes 700 older adults aged 70 years and older. They took part in interviewing about their health, vision, hearing, and physical functions. Their depressive symptoms were measured through the center for epidemiological studies. Depressive symptoms increased from baseline to following-up after two years of driving cessesation. Age was associated with declining out-of home activity levels. Driving Cessation was closely associated with decrease in out-Of-Home activity levels: coefficient-1.01, t and ar error 0.264 ""p.001"". Discussion When advising older people to avoid driving, physicians should take into account how many chronic medical conditions may lead to changes on driving ability. There are no tools available to directly predict motor vehicle collision in this population. The American Medec Society publishes an opinion-base guide for evaluating medical fitness to driver in older adult subjects. It recommends that doctors use the Assessment Of Driving Related Skills as a battery to measure visual, motor, and cognitive functions related to walking. Although there are no significant association between abnormal performance upon the test and history of crashes in the previous two years, these results indicate that some risk factors could be identified over time.",0.5934783844170558

He uses a large scale social experiment to examine whether the program has an impact on older children. The results suggest that the program may have positive effects on improving school attendance but also may reduce sexual activity among young women who are not explicitly targeted by the target group. This study compares the effect of unconditional cash transfer with conditional transfers for two different reasons: 1) households spend more money on education than they do on other expenses; and 2) there is no significant difference in spending on school expenses after only one year of the program. These results indicate that poverty-based cash transfer programs may have beneficial effects on affluent youth as well as on pregnancy and later marriage. Although the purpose of the country's ""Children's Cash Transform"" program is poverty relief, it does appear to have some important effects on mental health.

A prospective cohort of older patients undergo elective major surgical procedures from July 2005 to July 2006. They are divided into two groups: those with moderate declines at first and those with no decline at all. These groups include patients with mild impairment but not severe delirium. After hip fracture repair, these patients receive geriatry consultation which reduces delirium significantly.

The scale is well received and can be used as an assessment tool for predicting eating behavior in patients with high-risk preoccupations. However, it is not validated by a large enough sample; further studies need to be performed. For example, the Three-factor Eating Questionnaire has been developed to assess the severity of bingeing among overweight subjects. Although the results are mixed, they suggest that severe eaters tend to set up their own diets which are unrealistically strict. This study also uses the Eating Motive Survey as ancillary evidence for the usefulness of food choice in treating obesity.",0.40365709283602946

Physicians consider 95.4 %) of the sample, but only 75.5 % are compliant. Six factors are associated with compliance; treatment administration frequency, perceptions about long-term treat acceptability, perception's of health consequence of Osterosis, knowledge about Osteopsis, exercise and mentally quality of life. In this paper, we describe an observational cross-sectionalist pharmacogenological study in which patients were randomed to either the school or control group. They found no differences in Age or Score at entry and did not differ in Knowledge Score. This results in a significant improvement in knowledge over the course of the program.

It is a novel approach to improving patients' health by using a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. The study uses a mixed-method approach to examine the effectiveness of self-regarding exercises as an intervention for patients who are suffering from knee OA. Although initial compliance is high due to loyalty to the doctor, it is more complex because of the perception that they are effective in treating unpleasant symptoms. A precondition for continuing compliance was the perceived satisfaction with the treatment. Conclusions Non-compliant with physiotherapists, as with drugs, is common; from the patient's perspective, decisions about either or not complying are rational but sometimes can not be predictted by therapist/researchers.

In conclusion , up to date , evidence regarding the potential utility of IN-OT in treating anxiety and depression is still inconclusive .","In this study, we examine whether a form of neuropeptide known as oxytolin can be used to treat depression in women with maternal post-natal depression. We find that the mothers who receive oxytopcin show less depressive symptoms than those who take a placebo. However, they do show improvements in their self-centeredness and social awareness when compared to those who receive only a single daily dose of opium. This suggests that oxtocin's antipsychotic effects may also be beneficial in treating mental illness. The first study on mothers with post-partum depression is presented. It uses a double blinded cross-over trial to assess the effects of two daily doses of opportune parentage therapy on mood and behavior. After controlling for severity of depression, patients receiving opulent treatment showed greater changes in performance on reading the minds in the eyes task than did those receiving placebo.

All of the teeth are bonded using Transbond Plus, Transbond III, BeautyOrthotic Bond, and Salvatect. Shear bonds are measured at crosshead speeds of 5.0-mm/min in group I and 0.5-mm min in group II. Adhesion remnant index scores are calculated after the braces fail. The results suggest that it is necessary to identify the parameter included in sheare bonding testing in orderto enable meaningful comparison between the performance of various materialStudies 1: A total of 160 extracted human bicispids were separated into four groups. In Group I, they were treated with self-etched primers; for the remaining groups, enamel was conditioned with Self-etching Prime 3, Etch 'and Prime 3.' or Transbond plus. For the other two groups, tooth samples were etched before bonding. After bleaching, twenty teeth were bonded instantly and thirty were stored in Artificial Salivatectes. Sheer bond strength of all brackets was determined on universal testing machines. Adhsive remnant Index scores were determined upon the brackets failed. The result of this study suggests that office bleach does not adverseally affect the bond strengthof brackets matched immediately after bleachation or 30 days later after bleaching. Even though bleaching may result in differences from the failure sitesStudy 2: Two experiments were performed whereby pretreatment was done with dilute acid which contained salt sulphfate. This solution increased crystal growth but did not increase bond strength. Both experimentations showed that there was greater resistance to enamel fractures when etching instead of conventionally acid-etched materials. These experiments also revealed that many types of base designs and adhesive material were used today. They had different shear bond qualities than those found in either type of base. Bracketons were fabricated by three different methods: 1) Speed 2) Time 3) Acrylic Fixture 4) Polycrystalline Ceramic Bracket. Each method tested six times during each time group.

In subjects who receive high intensity exercise training, they experience greater gains in leg strength and physical function than those who receive low-resistence exercises alone. A further study is presented to determine whether progressive resistance training can reduce the risk for falls in elderly people. This study consists of two controlled trials: one designed to improve strength and balance while the other to prevent falls in frail old people. Both groups show significant improvement in their performance over three months. The first trial focuses on an older woman with a fall risk factor; the second examines the effect of a lifestyle-integrated approach to balance/strength training on improving balance and reduction of falls in community-living older people. The results indicate that ""facilty syndrome"" is more common among older adults than it was in other European populations.

Clinical relevance ART is an effective evidence -based option for treating and preventing carious lesions in primary and permanent posterior teeth","In this paper, the authors describe a community clinical trial of 704 schoolchildren in eight public schools in the Philippines to compare the effectiveness of three different methods for preventing dental caries: 1) using a single-handed application of 38 percent SDF on permanent teeth; 2) using an amalgam sealant with no treatment; and 3) using highvisosity glass cement with no energy supplied. The results indicate that the survival rate is significantly higher for primary first morals with intact or defective restorations. This suggests that there may be other options for restoring these defects. A low-cost glass cement used as a trauma restorative therapy was studied in two cities where it was found to have superior survival rates than those of conventional treatments. It was concluded that there was no significant difference in cumulative survival rates between retained composite resin, which was produced with high-viscotsity glasses, and a highly viscositous glass-Ionomer Cement, which had energy added to it. These studies were followed up by a controlled clinical trial in which 1,304 children aged 6 to 8 years old were treated with both types of material. After 3 years, all restored teeth were sealed.

Due to the use of anthropometry when determining body composition , a majority of the studies could not accurately address whether alterations in the fat and /or fat-free mass components of the body were responsible for the observed changes in body composition .
The effect of Zn supplementation on body composition is not consistent but may modify fat-free mass among children with pre-existing growth failure","In this study, we examine whether zinc supplementing early can prevent premature infants from stunting and improve their body composition. Preparations are made for a double blinded trial in which children aged 27 to 50 years of age receive 10 milliliters of zinc or a control dose of placebo. The results indicate that the child's growth is improved by the addition of zinc. Children with sickle-cell disease who attend poor social status do not benefit from zinc; however, they gain greater weight gains after 12 mo of zinc treatment. This suggests that prepubertal patients may have mildly zinc deficient but may benefit from increased growth potential. A double-blinded trial was conducted in which pregnant women were assigned either to receive 10mg zinc as zincmethionine or copper as Ferrous Sulfate. After six months, the children gained significant increases in height, midarm muscles area, and arm muscle circumference. No significant difference was observed at baseline except for changes in height and length. However, there was no change in infection rates between the zinc group and control subjects.

Trial Registration Australia New Zealand and Craphric Trials Registry Actrno 1260000467639 Study 1: Falling is common in the fast growing elderly population.Multitasking or engaged in two or three activities at the very same time is commonly in daily living. This study uses the trail walking test as an instrument to predict a fall among older individuals. It was first published in Japan in December 2008. Thirty five older adults aged sixty-five years completed the activities-specific balance Confidence scale, Berg balance scale, Dymimic GaitIndex, TimeD Up and Gotest, and Functional gait assessment. These measures were performed by thirty-five older persons aged 60 to90 years who completed the Activities specific balance Confidentence scale, ABC, Berg balanced scale, Dynamic gap Index, Timeed Up and gotest, TUG, and Dgi in community dwelling older people. Elderly subjects had greater difficulty in ADL/IADL than their counterparts but no difference in sociodemographic and medical characteristics between faller and non-falleners. Predictive value of the Timug test was better than that of other tests for prediction of falls among older people because it showed better discriminative validity and predictive validity.",0.5719907143490696

Motor skill development was unrelated to outdoor time ; however , this relationship was only examined in a single study of preschool children .
No studies were found that examined associations between outdoor time and musculoskeletal fitness","In this first study, we examine the relevancy and validity of a new approach to search for evidence in the medical literature using three different approaches: 1) PICO; 2) St and Ard; and 3) Web-based. We conclude that PICO is more accurate than either of the other two approaches because it uses a specific frame called ""Protocol A"" which focuses on questions rather than prompting for publication types or types of question asked. The results are similar between the two approaches but there is no significant difference in the precision of each question. This study furthermore investigates whether air pollution causes asthma onset among children. Children with nitrogen dioxide screens placed outside their homes for two weeks in the Summer and 2 weeks during the fall - winter season as markers of traffic related air pollution. These results suggest that airpollution contributes to newly-onset asthma. Pre-school years have been considered critical for raising physical activity levels in early life. There are many pre-school activities available, including sports clubs, outdoor playtimes, and indoor/outdoor activities. However, few factors seem to be associated with physical activity in these early years. Thus, an outdoor program will help promote physical activity through early childhood.",0.08989074595257165

Conclusions Physical activity and healthy diets in early childhood are associated with better cognitive outcomes  in young children .","In this study, we examine the association between childhood weight and school outcomes in a nationally representative sample of children who enter kindergarten in the United States. We find that boys who become overweight are more likely to be absent from school than boys who remain normal weight. This suggests that early childhood risk factors may lead to poorer school outcomes for blacks and hispanics but not for whites.

This meta- analysis supports the use of task-oriented circuit class training to improve gait and gait-related activities in patients with chronic stroke .","In this paper, the authors present a new gait-training strategy for patients after stroke. They compare structured speed- dependent treadmill training with conventional gait treatment in order to improve walking speed and cadence in post-stroke patients. The results show that the structured walk training is more effective than either of the two traditional gait training strategies. A second study examines the effect of task-oriented exercise on balance function in people with acute stroke. Sixty subjects were assigned to an experimentation group and received eight weeks of exercises focused on balance and movement. After four weeks, the experimental group improved walking speed significantly but did not increase walking capacity. This further suggests that routine provision of community-based walks programs would be advantageous in reducing disgrace after stroke.""",0.9972767577622966

Apparently malnutrition has not a great impact on malaria morbidity , but could have a negative impact on malaria mortality and severity .
Most studies show no association between malaria and subsequent malnutrition in P. falciparum areas .
In Plasmodium vivax endemic areas , malaria was associated with malnutrition in children .","In this paper, the authors describe a prospective study of children with cerebral malnutrition who have been treated in the Madang general hospital. The results indicate that there is no association between disease and malnourished status; however, it does suggest that age may play a role in the association. Children aged 0 to 2 years old are more likely to die from malaria than other children because of their low weight for age. This suggests that all deaths due to undernutriation are attributable only to poor weight forage. A further study is presented on the relation of CCK-factor-alpha, TNF-p55, and solubleTNF receptors to the anoezial and wasting caused by HIV infection. It is concluded that changes in these factors may lead to increased levels of inflammation associated with tuberculosis. Furthermore, studies have shown that certain diseases can lead to stunting or death in susceptible children. Thus, improved preventive measures need to be considered.",0.013803936396329021

The first is a single-dose regimen with no difference in complications; the second is based on ceftiaxone or chloramophicol; and the third is an all-oral regimen using ciprocofloxaciin. They conclude that it is better to use ciproloxacin than norfloxicin or chlorumphenicol because they are more cost effective. A double-blinded study was conducted where 150 men were treated with lidocaines 1 % for 10 days before the procedure. Four men developed sepisis after the procedure while none had any complications. This study confirms our previous results about carbenicillin's efficacy in reducing fever and Ury tract infection following transrectical biopsy. Prostate biopsy has been used as a means of detection of prostatic disease but there is disagreement regarding whether its efficaciousness depends on the presence of susceptible organisms. Antibiotic treatment prior to the procedure reduces the risk of infections caused by streptomycians. However, we do not find any patient groups at a higher risk of developing infectious complications after transderal biopsy. We also report that fluoroquilone-resistant cultures are isolated among patients who receive targeted antimicrobial therapy. These studies suggest that long-term prophylactic strategies may be useful in preventing outbreaks of infectious complications from transrectal breast biopsy.",0.9911444366811493

The results indicate that there are significant barriers to uptaking evidence in practice, particularly in terms of lack of time and uncertainty about what is being published. A greater emphasis on research while training will be needed for improving health care. In this study, a self-questioning instrument is used to assess the extent towhich personal characteristics and features of the social systems in the work influence the propenity of physical therapy to adopt evidence-based practice. It is found that desire for learning, highest degree hold, practicality, and nonconsistency are the best predictors for propensity toward adopting evidence-base practice. Although most changes are not significant, there is a consistency pattern of decline amongst the first workforce years: Relevance; Terminology; Confidence; Practice; Sympathy; Disposition towards EBP. However, these changes do not seem to be significant enough to make a significant difference in the propensities of allied medical professionals to adopt EbP.

The results indicate that multiple risk factors increase the risk of spinal fusion wound infection. These include age, gender, and previous trauma; however, they do not reveal any association between these risk factors. This is important because it will enable surgeons to reduce the rate of complications following spine surgery. Two studies relate smoking to morbidity: one reports that current smoking has a significantly greater risk of both surgical site infections and total wound complications than never-mokers; another reports that patients with pack year history of more than 40 packs had a significant higher risk of spider vein infection. A further study examines the risk factor for postoperative myelopathies in patients with motor neuron disease. Although there is no clear relationship between nerve regeneration and scarlet fever, several studies have examined the effect of such events on patient outcome. For example, two studies have reported that preoperative blood cell counts are associated with an elevated risk of deep wound infection after open spine surgeries. Another study uses a case control approach to identify independentrisk factors for acute or delayed wound infection among adult patients. It finds that preoperatory steroid treatment, spinal trauma, and gender are independent risk factors as well as an operating time longer than 3 hours. Furthermore, some patients with renal disorders, chronic sterroid use, and diabetes have increased odds of developing severe wound infection upon elective spine procedures.

No difference was found when RM-GIC was compared with fluoride-containing composite resin .
RM-GIC showed efficacy in reducing demineralization .","In this paper, the authors present a revised version of the Consolr statement that was originally published in the early 2000s. The new edition includes 22 items that were removed from the original statement because of evidence that not reporting these information is involved with biased estimates of treatment efficacy or because the details are essential to judge reliability or relevance. This study uses an in-vito caries model to evaluate the effect of fluorde-releasing restourative material on enamel and dentin. The results indicate that all restorative materials provide some protection against caries when used with fluoride; however, there is no association between the two. A double blind crossover study is carried out to examine the effects of microleakedage on tooth surfaces surrounding restorations exposed to fluorine. These studies suggest that while it may be possible to prevent caries from occurring around restorations, anticoagulation might be necessary for patients who do not have specific contraindications. Since the last thorough review of anticipation in acute Myocardial Infa St Ion trials has been reported, four additional control trials have also been reported. Anticoagulation does not lead to significant reductions in case of caries development. However, several other controlled trials report no effect due to the fact that the differences favoringanticoagulation did not statisticallysignificant. Thus, any patient who does not have a specific contrandication must receive anticoagulant during their hospitalization.",0.013450165446858396

The first study was a double blinded trial in which patients received 15 or 100 milligrams of vitaminD per day for six months. This results in improved health scores between December and February. The second study showed that both doses reduced parathyroid Hormone with no change in plasma calcium. Both groups also improved their wellbeing scores.

He concludes that they can be used to prevent back pain and neck pain from workers. He also discusses the Stay@Work trial, which is designed to assess the effectiveness of ""participatory ergonomics"" in preventing these two common injuries. The results are very positive: workers report less pain during the stretch group than those who do not perform it. This study furthermore examines the effect of supplemental rest breaks for patients with low back pain. It is concluded that a change in rest breaks reduces discomfort and fatigue but does not increase worker productivity. Two studies are published in this issue: one concerning the use of a hipbelt as an intervention against upper-arm musculodyskeletal disorders; and another concerning the effects provided by a fordarm support board as an aid in relieving shoulder pain.

The results suggest that young adults living in Northern Ireland do not consume adequate daily  diet to maintain their blood concentrations during winter. A double blinded randolf controlled intervention study is performed to assess the effect of an eight-week regimen of calcium and Vitamin D on bone mineral density and bone turnover among healthy young people who live in northern Irel. Both groups have low levels of serum 25hhD but there is no effect on bone turnover marker or parathyroid Hormone concentrations. There is no change in bone mineral content in the entire population of girls. Two studies examine the efficaciousness of either a daily dose of 15 ng. m.1 or 1500 mg. d. over 12 months; they indicate that both groups have significantly higher levels of 25hHD than the control group. This suggests that young adult women in Northern Iarel do not receive sufficient daily dietary consumption to maintain pulse vitamin D concentration at all. These studies may lead to future positive health implications. Three studies relate the use of high-dose vitamin D to reduce the risk of common malignancies: 1) a four-y-month population-based doubleblind trial 2) a two-year placebo-controlled experiment 3) a three-year open-ended trial 4) a long-term observational study 5) a single-year treatment with 1,000 IU of cavacalciferyl plus 1,800 mol. 6) a nine-month period of follow-up followed by a six-month interval of continuous observation.

We find that topical creams are more effective than topical EMla cream because of their anti-inflammatory action after the procedure. The use of cold cooling is used frequently in dermatological treatments. This study investigates the effect of cool air cooling on pain control when using the alex or rite 755nm long pulsed dye lance. A patient with darker skin Type III-V was treated with an alex/rite 7,575 nm Long Pulsed Dy Laser at 3 milli seconds. There were no significant differences in pain relief between the two treatment groups. Short spurt durations were preferred for pain reduction; longer spurt lengths were preferable for epidermalprotection. These results suggest that short spurt intervals may not be necessary in some patients who have darker skin types. Another study examines agreement and estimate difference in pain severity between pain assessment measures. It uses a four category verbal scale and an 11 point numeric scale to compare pain intensity and relief from different patients. They found that the cutoff points best associated with ""a patient-determined clinically important response"" closely resemble those found in earlier studies. Furthermore, these changes in pain measure provide support for future trials of pain medicine. For example, portwinestains can be effectively ablation by pulsed color dye laser.

A model that predicts the probability of an horn disrupt lesions in the subsequent milking is developed. Lactation groups, previous ChDL, matureéquivalent 304-d milk Yield, season, BCS At drying off, and sire Phta for strength all significantly associate with lamelessness at the dry off. These riskfactors for CHDL are included in our prediction model; we could have detected 33 percent of the studied populace as being atrisk, eventually leading to 59 %) of future CHD cases. This paper also describes a two-year experiment on claw trimming by cows selected on their herd size, breed composition, and membership in official milk recording scheme. In autumn, cows inside each herd was blocked according to breeding, parities and stage oflacation and assigned to two treatments: autumn trimming or no autumn triming. Outcom outvariable risks were associated with changes in outcome such as lameness/lesions. Overall Farm risks were estimated by summing the products of general severity for these hazards with onfarm risks. Improvements in Ofr were significantly linked to change in outcome Lameness and Lesions.

We conclude that ranitidine is associated with increased risk of complications, including a higher rate of nosocoleptic pneumonia than controls. This study further investigates the effect of short-term treatment on gastric lesion in newborns with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. It was found that prophylactic therapy for short-lived infants had a beneficial effect on these conditions. The aim now is to determine the frequency and type of mucousal lessions in newborn babies under stress. A population of five180 infants from June 1988 to May 1997 was examined. There were 53 cases of Ugb within 26.5 hours of life. After an endoscopic exam, the patients were divided into four groups: control group, which received ranitine; attack group, consisting of 590 infants; plus 740 infants receiving pantorazole; and attack group composed of 40 infants given either ranitinine or placebo. These subjects showed no significant differences in their intestinal damage. They also did not experience any side effects. However, other factors such as age, birth weight, and gestational Age were important predictors of bloodstream infection. For example, those with severe lung disease are more likely to survive during their stay in the hospital than those with milder health.

After 6 weeks of active treatment, nonresponders increase significantly in response to paronoxetine but no significant side effects or development of mmania occur. This is similar to the earlier studies on selective serotonephrine/reuptake-inhibitors that have been published. A double blinded, rand and ommized, doubleblind study compares the efficaciousness and tolerableability of escilopram and diloxetine as antidepressedants in patients with Major depressive disorder. The primary aim of the study was to test the effect of dulacetine on Hamilton Depression Rating scale items for patients who had severe depression. Dulacine has a greater reduction in Hamilton's score than does esciplopram; however, different Hamilton scores respond differently to both regimens. These differences may be helpful in tailoring an antidepressan therapy for individual patient patients. Although there is little evidence against switching to another drug after unsuccessful treatment for major depression, several studies have attempted to analyze missing data using likelihood-based approaches. One such study uses the Mixed-effect Model Repeatedic Measure model to examine the effectiveness of two different drugs in treating patients with serious depression.",0.6991806939446706

Conclusions and Relevance In this meta- analysis of r and omized clinical trials , the use of supplements that included calcium , vitamin D , or both compared with placebo or no treatment was not associated with a lower risk of fractures  among community-dwelling older adults .","This study focuses on the effects of four-months of daily vitamin D in patients with low blood levels. The results suggest that daily doses of four000 IU may be required for lower disease risk and should be tested again in future trials to prevent fractures. In this study, we examine the effect of daily treatment over one year on blood test of vitamin D's status as well as other risk factors. A reduction in fractures is observed among community-dweling elderly people who are deficient in Vitamin D. Two studies have been performed: first, a large double-blinded placebo-control trial was conducted regarding the benefits of calcium citric supplementation; second, an eight-section brocade trial was designed to improve the symptoms andindices associated with bone loss in older women living in community dwelling.

They treat 251 patients who have paroxysmmal or permanent atrial fillation and demonstrate that it is possible to use electrodes surrounding both pulmonary vessels in order to induce an electric current into the lesion. The results suggest that electrodes may be more effective than individual electrodes as they are easier to manipulate and less likely to lead to arrhythmic symptoms.

In this paper, we report results from an extended follow-up period after the trial was ended. After nine years, there were 273 deaths in 478 patients assigned to receive treatment. A trend for interaction between disease stage and disease severity was observed; however, no difference in rate of death from any cause or other malignancies occurred between the arms. Adjuvant chemotherapy continues to show significant benefit in terms of overall survival but does not seem to improve survival in patients who have completely resecected disease. This study also reports that it has been shown that adjuvant regimens can extend survival in people with completely omically rescected disease as well as those who have a high risk of death due to other causes.",0.024844399494506703

This study compares three commonly used methodologies for measuring pain during trials using patients with fagmyalgy. Fourteen patients were asked to track their pain over a 12-week period: 1) real time pain reports; 2) end-of week reports; and 3) monthly inclinic reports. These methods are more accurate than the conventional methods because they involve self-efficiacacy. Furthermore, these methods have been shown to be superior to the traditional methods by improving patient adherence. This paper also describes a new type of pain diary which uses interaction graphs to analyze the relationship between pain severity and sleep quality. It was found that patients who had greater pain variability were less likely to respond immediately to drug treatment than those who had smaller pain fluctuation.

The results suggest that they may be useful for treating patients with tension type headache. Although tricyclics have been used as first-line agents for treating chronic tension Type headache, their side effects are conflicting. A double blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of fluoxetine on headache was performed. Thirty-four patients were treated with either amitriline or desipromine.

The different effect on diastolic BP means that beta-blockers have little or no effect on pulse pressure whereas thiazides cause a significant dose-related decrease in pulse pressure .
This difference in the pattern of BP lowering with beta-blockers as compared to thiazides might be the explanation for the fact that beta-blockers appear to be less effective at reducing adverse cardiovascular outcomes than thiazide diuretics , particularly in older individuals","In a prospective cohort study, the risk of death from heart disease and all causes is similar to that of chest disease alone.

Observational studies revealed that location and quantity of televisions correlated with SD behavior with the latter having a greater effect on girls .
This was similarly found for the quantity of PA equipment which also correlated with behavior in females .","In this study, we examine the association between physical activity and weight status among children and young adults. Boys participate significantly more than girls in terms of MVPA while distance to school is a significant predictor of their participation.

In this study, forty-two boys aged 8 to 16 years were evaluated twice before and after an eight-month aerobic training program. A significant reduction in medication score and daily use of either inhaled or oral steroids was associated with improvement in the fitness of the patients. Aerobic improvements with training were associated with reducing the medication score as well as the daily consumption of both in haled andoral steroids. Children with less fit asthmatics are also related to improved short term decreases in the daily uses of bothinhaled andororal steroids independent of severity of disease. This study compares the effects of two different types of exercises: strength training and resistance training. Both groups increase the maximum weight lift for bceps curl but not upper body strength; however, these differences do not remain significantly after control for raise in height. These studies aim to improve understand and the marketplace for child care in Saudi Arabia. Although exercise might be beneficial in Cyctic fibrosists, patients' high tolerance to heat stress means they lose their fluid needs during prolonged exposure to hot climates. They report that fatigue is reduced by exhaustion from excessive sweating. However, there are other factors that influence peak performance in children without severe disease. Short-term physical activity reduces blood pressure and early signs of atherocity in overweight children. There are no significant changes in body mass, body fat, and cardiorespitory fitness among obese children.",0.42705058006081015

After two months, both levels increase significantly. There are no significant differences between these values. The results suggest that daily or weekly dosing frequency can be used to optimize individual 'adherence with long term vitamin Dsupplation. Study 1: A prospective cohort study of the protective association between 25-Hysteriamin D status and the risk of rarer cancers is presented. It was concluded that higher concentrations were associated with greater risk of pancreatic malignancies. This study has applications for planning and conducting intervention trials. First, it is reported that calcium and Vitamin D may lower blood stress. Second, there is no difference in the incidence of heart disease among postmenomepausal females. Third, studies suggest that high-doses of either mineral or vitamin D may reduce bone loss. Fourth, studies indicate that adequate amounts of both mineral and vitamin D help prevent fractures in elderly people living in care homes. Finally, studies report that increased consumption of both nutrients may reduce the risk from breastcancer. These studies conclude that ""calciton plus vitamin D"" does not reduce breastcarrying risk. However, some studies have suggested that increasing total caloric intake increases the risk by preventing colorectinal tumors.

Results indicate that yoga interventions improve multiple physical function and HRQoL outcomes in this population compared to both control conditions .
This study provides robust evidence for promoting yoga in physical activity guidelines for older adults as a multimodal activity that improves aspects of fitness like strength , balance and flexibility , as well as mental wellbeing .","In this paper, the authors describe a pilot study of a 12-week program for patients with chronic asthma. The results suggest that it is safe and feasible to use a yoga regimen in patients with diseased lungs. They also report that there are small positive effects on physical performance, mental well being, and health related quality of life. A further investigation into the effect of regular exercise on health-related qualities of life in older adults is presented. It is found that both groups show significant improvements in measures of balance, strength, and mobility. This suggests that regular practice may be more effective than stretching exercises in improving fitness. Furthermore, studies have suggested that practicing such an exercise can improve risk profiles among adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. However, the limitations of these studies preclude draw firm conclusions. Further research needs to be performed to confirm the effectiveness of any type of intervention by type of Yoga.",0.7534055080748385

In this study, we examine the effect of daily weight tracking on hospitalization and readmission rates among patients with advanced-stage heart failure. We conclude that there is no significant difference between the primary end points of repatientation and mortality when compared to the AleReNet system. The results suggest that it is the largest single-centre, rand-omized trials of a device-based daily weigh and symptom monitoring system for patients With advanced heart failure."" Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and death in older adults. A pilot study investigates whether telephoning by an advanced nurse reduces subsequent hospitalreadmissions, emergency department visitations, costs, and riskof hospital readmission as well as the cost of outpatient care for patients who have congestive hearts failure. Both groups have significantly lower readmissions than usual care.

We conclude that both forms of treatment have no beneficial effects on patients with non-alcoholic fat liver disease. Ageing is believed to be associated by reduced vascular function because of oxative stress. The aim here is to determine whether or not reversatrol can improve blood vessel function in aged men. A healthy young man, age 65 years old, was randized into either a control group or a random placebo group for eight weeks. Both groups showed significant improvements in body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, and lipoprotein concentrations.

Evidence for AN treatment is weak ; evidence for treatment-related harms and factors associated with efficacy of treatment are weak ; and evidence for differential outcome by sociodemographic factors is nonexistent .","A controlled trial compares family therapy to individual supportive treatment in patients with a malnourished, anorezia-nervosal condition. The results indicate that the patient's weight is restored and they are able to return to normal body weight after one year of mental treatment. Family therapy is superior to individual support in older patients who have not yet recovered from their illness. However, this study suggests that supplement strategies may not be a replacement for adequate nutrition; therefore, it is recommended that these treatments be combined with other psychological approaches. An eighty-four-year-old patient with anorexia nervocsa receives four different types of psychotherapy: 1) short-term group therapy; 2) long-term groups therapy; and 3) ""low contact"" or ""routine"" treatment.

This study compares it to the mini-beestest, which is an alternative measuring system that uses balance systems. It has a higher likelihood ratio for walking and falls than the other two measures. People with more than one sclerical disease are at high risk for falling. In this paper, we examine the reliability of the dynamic gait index, or DGI, in predicting whether someone will fall. We find that there is a significant cutoff point for identifying individuals at risk of falling. However, when compared to controls, the BBS scores have a greater negative likelihood ratio than those of the other three measures. A comparison between the Bbs and the miniature beestest suggests that they may be better predictors because they have lower ceiling effects on each secondary measure. Furthermore, their results suggest that the size of the smaller scale may improve detection of changes in balance among people who have multiple slicities. Study 1: An investigation into the effect of balance-specific rehabilitation on balance measures and fever severity in people with multi-sicculosis. Methods were conducted in a bicentrer-blinded controlled trial. Participants received 20 treatments; participants in the intervention receive treatment aim aimed at improving balance while the control group receives treatment to reduce limitation at activity and bodily function level. Results showed that both groups had significantly reduced the frequency of falls during the follow up period. Conclusions: Twenty exercises 2-3 times per week do not reduce fallfrequency nor improve balanceimplying the need for further and challenging interventions. Implications for Rehabilitation programs for balance rehabilitation could improve balance but Their effects in fall prévention are unclear.",0.870933887558583

The outcome was similar to that of older subjects treated with diurtics: blood pressure had declined to a comparable extent in both group. There were six95 cardiovascular events nor deaths from any causes in the ace-inhibitors group; 56.1 per thousand patient-year's. The hazardration for a heart attack or death with an ace inhibitor treatment was 1.89 p.0.05. This is not surprising since it is more likely that these patients will have fatal strokes than those treated with other agents. Although there are some slight differences in the rate of myocarital infatriate ions and strokes among the two groups, they are still statistically different. Both regimens reduce blood pressure to well within their normal limits. A significant relationship between fall into systelic blood pressure as well as initial blood pressure was observed in 255 hypertensively subjects given placebo after a 3wk lead-in period.

Self-adhesive resin cements were found to be less technique-sensitive to luting procedures as compared with regular resin cements","In this study, the effects of etching and chlorhexamine on the bond-strength of a fiber post is investigated. The cement used in this trial is RelyX unicem 3mespe - RXU, which has been used for partial crowns with selective enamel absorption. After three years, all restorations are retained except for eight that fail at Kaplan's Meier test. At least one patient survives after three years; however, there are no significant differences between the two groups over time. A self-etched resin cement called RX U, which can be used as a replacement for selective enamel Absorption, performs better than either strategy. This study investigates the effect of pretreatment by chlorheexidine and ethanol on the strength and durabilityof the adherement of the fiber posts relining with resin composite into root dentinate. Thirty bovine roots were divided up into four groups: irrigation with control, five minutes with chlorhixidine, 1 minute using EtOH, and 5minutes with chlorhecidine followed by1 minute with EtOh. Fiber posts cemented to root dentine were cemented according to the following agents: Parapost Fiberlux, PanaviA 21, Cleanfil Esthetic Ciement, Clf, VarioLink II, Var, EGC, 7.65+/4.79MPa. The sealing ability of each agent was not different from the coronal, middle, and anapical section. However, the type of interfering material did influence the pushout bond strength. These results were compared to those of other cements such as Duolink Unicem or Scotch Bond Multipurpose.",0.4558603794724247

The intervention is based on self-determination theory and social learning theories. In addition, the students are given an opportunity to participate in family events and take home activities with less participation than in control schools. A significant increase in knowledge andcultural identity among American Indian kids is evident from their repeated third and fourth grades test items. Conclusions that this school-based program can promote positive change in knowledge, cultural identity, and healthful food service will be further discussed in Chapter 1, ""Bathways"" and Chapter 2, ""Study1"". Although previous studies have suggested that children can gain muscular strength and endurance by regular participation in progressive resistance training, little evidence has yet been found regarding the effectiveness of these exercises. Children do not respond well to high repetitions of heavy load or moderate load training; however, they show greater gains in 1-repetitionmaxed strength and muscle endurance than those resulted from low repetitions - heavy load training. These findings supports the concept that muscles and muscular endurance may be improved during childhood years and prefer the prescription of lower repetition - moderate load resistancetraining programs during initial adaptation period.",0.9923559722585268

Addition of fibrates to statins can enhance the Lp(a)-lowering effect of statins","In this study, we examine the association between high lipoprotein levels and increased risks of myosclerotic infamy ion. We conclude that genetically elevated Lipoprotein is associated with higher risk of myofamyalinfa-rct-ion than those at lower levels. The results are similar to those obtained from three studies of white patients who have been followed up for 16 years. These studies include the Copenhagen Heart Study, the Danish General Population Study, and the Denmark Ischemic heart disease Study.

There is insufficient data with regard to the benefits and potential adverse effects in the most at risk infants weighing less than 1000 grams at birth","In this study, the effects of Lactobacterium acidophilus on infants with low birth- weight are compared. The results indicate that Lactobacilus reduces the risk of Necrotic Enterocolitis in preterm premature infants. Preterm babies who receive probiotics have a lower incidence of Necterizing Enterocotis than those who receive no probiotic treatment. This is due to the fact that early colonization by beneficial bacteria has a protective effect on intestinal motility. A double blinded, placebo controlled trial was performed on 229 preterm infant girls weighing from 500 to 1499g at birth. The first outcome was the reduction of necrotating enterocoitis and the second was the decrease in the severity of Nescorts or death. Both groups had similar rates of mortality and were not associated with any adverse effects. Two studies were conducted: one concerning the use of Bfidophagium Lactis as a preventive measure against nosocomic infections; and another concerning the efficaciousness of probiotic regimens for preventing late-onset disease in very lowbirth-women.

CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest that programs should facilitate and support women to participate in regular exercise by embedding physical activity programs in public health initiatives , by developing home-based exercise programs that require few re sources and by creating interventions that can incorporate physical activity within a healthy lifestyle .
The review also suggests that clinicians should consider prescribing exercise in a tailored manner for older women to ensure that it is of a high enough intensity to obtain the positive sustained effects of exercise","This study focuses on the effects of exercise training in older adults with mild balance dysfunction. The results indicate that there is an association between exercise training to improve balance and strength in older people who are at moderately elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. In this study, Dr. Rowe's laboratory has been used to assess balance function in older women aged 70-89. He concludes that ""Mild balance dysfunction"" is associated with increased risk of heart attack and mortality.

CONCLUSIONS There are few well-vali date d FND-specific outcome measures .","In this study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of brief Augmented Psychological Interpersonal Therapy for patients with non-seizure-induced seizures. We enlist two random groups of patients who will receive their diagnoses from a neurologists and epilpsy specialist in order to determine whether or not CBT is an effective treatment for these patients. The first group will receive information about their seizures and be told about it three months later. The second group will get detailed instructions on how to participate in the trial. They will also receive a written description of the intervention as well as a qualitative evaluation of the participants' views of the therapy.",0.8704457306670559

In the control group, mothers avoided cow's milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soy, and fish; however, they were more distressed than those in the mother's group. The reduction in cry-fuss time was greater in the low allergen group, but there was no significant difference in the duration of coughing over 48 hours. Mothers' subjective assessment of the response to diet showed little difference from the groups. Conclusions that exclusion of allergy from the maternal feed was associated with an improvement in distressed behavior during breastfed infantses with infantile conlic. Probiotics have been shown to increase the amount of beneficial bacteria within the bowel as a way to promote gut flour reemblance to breast-fed babies. This study compares the safety and tolerated effect of probiotic Lactobacilus relatérali DSM17 938 on infantic colic.

He discusses the results of two studies that have been performed on children and concludes that it is superior to other methods for managing these caries. The first study was published in the Journal of Oral Science in June of 2006. It compares traditional restorations with biological treatment strategies based on seal-in or mechanical cements. The second trial is being conducted in the FiCTION Trial, a British Society of paediatric Dentistry program designed to assess the efficability of conventional restorations in children'primary teeth. This trial uses an outcome measure called the incidence of pain or infection associated with dental caries as a measure of how effective the treatment is. The main outcome measures are patient quality of Life, cost effectiveness, acceptance of treatment strategies by patients and their families and their experiences. The third trial is going to be carried out in the Isr CtStudy 1, a prospective observational study about the survival of glass-iomer cement, phosphorus-fil, and preformed steel crowns in primary tooth surfaces over a 7-year period at a specialist dentist under private contract",0.09227447652040963

A total of 25 elderly men were assigned into two groups: a block periodized group and a daily unduling periodised group. Both groups showed significant improvement in muscle strength, power, functional performance, balance, and quality-of-life. In contrast, the control group showed little to moderate improvements in muscular strength,power,functional performance,balance, andquality of life. This study compares the effect of periodsized versus not-periodicized resistance training upon neuromuscular adjustions in older adult women. Forty-One apparently healthy un trained older adults were recruited and stratified to either an NP or block periodization, block periodizing group, or dailyundulating periodizated group.

There was a significant decrease in lean mass but total bone mineral dense in both groups. Furthermore, there were no differences in self-respected physical functioning, dynamic balance, leg extension force, and bone structures. However, to maintain gains in muscles force and physical functions, continued training seemed necessary.

The authors compare two different types of restorations, one with a single bond and another with an enamel bevel. All but one is replaced after five years. After 5 years, all but one restorative group retains at least 100 percent of its original value. Only minor discoloration occurs in the margins of both groups. A new type of composite called ""giomer composite"" has been introduced to improve the performance of conventional tooth-colored material. This study uses a microfilified resin composite as a replacement for traditional cements. In this study, each patient receives only one or two sets of restored teeth per tooth. Each patient's retention rate is 96 percent for the composite and 78 percent for either material. At 10 years, however, there is no difference in the average length of time between the two treatments. For example, three patients have retained more than 50 restorations during their 10-year period.

This study supports the use of a patient-led disease management program for patients with high-risk heart failure. In China, this approach has been shown to be more successful than in other countries. However, at least half of these patients still have uncontrolled blood pressure. A community-based lifestyle intervention was found to improve blood pressure levels in children and adults in low income developing countries. Trials were conducted in two countries -- China and Nigeria -- wherein hypertension was the key factor preventing it from being managed effectively.

In contrast , when more complex assessment s are used , modafinil appears to consistently engender enhancement of attention , executive functions , and learning .
Importantly , we did not observe any preponderances for side effects or mood changes .","In a parallel group study, 60 healthy young adult volunteers were assigned to receive either 100 or 200mg modafinill prior to performing several tasks designed to test memory. The subjects showed no significant changes in self-rated sleepiness or fatigue before the tests; there were no change in mood during the tests. However, they did show improvements in performance on short-term recall and pattern recognition tasks. Modafinl was not clearly dose related but improved performance on various tests of memory, executive function, visuopspatial and constructal ability, or categoryfluency. This study suggests thatmodafinil might be useful for treating attention deficion hyperactivity disorder. A recent study has shown that functional magnetic resonance images can be used as a valuable tool for detecting regional brain responses when changes in sensory stimulus are detected. Although these results suggest that cortical activity levels in normal subjects may be increased following the treatment of modafiel, it is not clear whether this effect is due to prepotent response or an altered ability to suppress pre potent responds. Furthermore, we have examined the effects of moravfinil on both learning and neural activities related to cognition in patients with neuropsychic disorders. We therefore conduct a doubleblind crossover study using functional magnetic reconversation imaging to determine the extent of visual and audible activation in normal people and those with narracoleptic disease. Both groups showed better learning performance than controls. These results hint that modavirl may be beneficial in treating attention-deficit hyperactivity Disorder. Brain scans indicate that mamma-dependent subjects exhibit lower levels of cortically activated cortex than control subjects. To further investigate the efficacy of combined therapy with modafranl, we examine the effects upon learning and nervous functions in healthy volunteers. After two weeks, the improvement in learning is greatest over the initial five sessions.

In addition, it reduces the risk of developing Type 2 disease by assuring greater weight loss and improved glyceric control. The results of this study are described in three studies: 1) a large, multi-arm irrational trial of 418 subjects aged 55-80 years; 2) a small, single-arm observational study of 318 adults at high risk of type 2 disease; and 3) a prospective long-term follow-up study of 1,500 people with type 2 who have been assigned to one group of diets. This study was designed to examine the effect of replacing saturated fatty acid with monounsaused fatty acids on the development Of Insulin Sensibility. It was found that these changes were associated with all cause and cause specific mortality in older-onset dibetic subjects. After 16 years of following-up, 824 persons died from all-caus and cause-specified mortality.

A double blind, single blind study was conducted on 40 subjects with Type 2, who were assigned either to receive a placebo over a period of 6 months or to receive 500 g chmium daily as chromium picironate. The primary endpoint was a reduction in A1c values. The secondary endpoints were changes in lipoprotein profile, blood pressure, body fat, and insulinsensitivity. No significant differences were found between the intervention groups.

In this study, 609 patients are enrolled in an open label trial for six years. They receive maintenance doses from 0.4 to 2 mg daily after completion of their initial studies. A total sample of 2674 patients from several centers has been studied. International Prostage Symptom Score, Uroflowmetry, and combined medications are reviewed. After 8 weeks, treatment satisfaction is increased by duration, baseline symptoms, and prostate volume. However, most patients are not satisfied with the treatment because they have efficacy issues or side effects. For patients with severe lests suggestive of prostatichypoplasia, the dosage should be increased sooner. This study is a prospective, cross-examinational study designed to determine whether transcranial ultrasonography can predict the patient's clinical response to alpha 1 blocker or anti- androgen therapy. It was performed in China during April 1994 to June 1995.

Previous cost-effectiveness analyses ( 719 ) show that statin therapy is generally cost-effective for secondary prevention and for high-risk primary prevention but do not focus on population -level impact or average cost-effectiveness across the heterogeneous U.S. population , including such subgroups of patients as those with low risk but very high cholesterol levels .
Also , it is unclear whether the ATP III approach to risk stratification , in which risk is formally assessed only for patients with 2 or more established risk factors , is the simplest and most cost-effective way of targeting statin therapy .
The 2004 up date to ATP III ( 3 ) notes that treatment of high-risk subgroups may be useful even when cholesterol levels are low , which suggests that a more purely risk-based approach may be simpler and more cost-effective than the ATP III approach .","In this study, the authors assess the costeffectiveness of 40-mg simva statin daily for life in patients with different ages and risk of recurrent heart disease. They conclude that it is more cost effective than lifetime treatment because people aged 40 to 80 years have lower risks of artery disease. The Beaver Dam Heart Outcome Study, a long-term cohort study of women's health, was published in March of 1993. Thirty five factors were assessed from 24 558 initial healthy US women at age 45 or older who had been followed up for 10 years for incident events. These factors included smoking, hypertension, and diabetes. Although these factors did not predict sudden cardiac death in women, they suggest that their elevated risk of stroke may be related to their greater relative risk of having a coronary heart condition.

The first is a double blinded placebo-controlled pilot study in which 200 patients with mild symptoms of early benign prostatichypoplasia were treated with fiststeric finasterides for six months. After these initial results, the patients received no significant changes on their prostate volume or urinary symptoms. The second study was a mixed-effects trial in which men with moderately severe symptoms were given fistolide 5m/day for 6 months and then switched from placebo until they had a complete reduction in their symptoms. Both trials showed good safety and efficiacy. A sub-study examined the effects of fistrelsteric treatment across different age levels in an ethnic diverse population of man with benign prospecified hyperplusa. Men with moderate to serious symptomatic disease were assigned to receive either fistersteric therapy or placebo. They experienced a marked improvement in Urodynamic effect of the five alpha-Reductasic inhibitor Finasterde; there were no significant side effects. This paper also discusses the association among lower urinarry tract symptoms, prostate- specific antigen, and estructile dysfunction in men with ""benign Prostatic hyperplaa"" who have enlarged their prostates.

Class IA , IC , and III drugs are effective in maintaining sinus rhythm but increase adverse effects , and class IA drugs may increase mortality","In this double blinded, multicentre, placebocontrolled study, Dofetileide was moderately effective for converting atrium fibrillation into sinus rhythm. A significant reduction in the rate of remaining in sinrhythmia occurred after one year of treatment with either drug. The mean age and severity of life assessment were significantly better in the antiarctic drug group than those in the short-form health survey. Two patients had torsadesde de points; one had a sudden cardiac death classified as Proarrhythmic on day 8; another had an episode of spontaneous relapse or death. This is not surprising since it is considered first line therapy for patients with syphilis.

They are also more likely to be stopped due to inadequate therapeutic response/intolerable sideeffects. Study 1: To determine whether flecasinide vs quinidine can be used to prevent atrial fillation in patients with severe heart disease. These two drugs are particularly effective because they cause less side effects than sotallol.

Either intramuscular or oral ( 1.0 mg ) vitamin K prophylaxis improves biochemical indices of coagulation status at 1 - 7 days .
Neither intramuscular nor oral vitamin K has been tested in r and omized trials with respect to effect on late HDN .
Oral vitamin K , either single or multiple dose , has not been tested in r and omized trials for its effect on either classic or late HDN","In this study, we investigate the effect of vitamin K absence on the detection of PIVK-II in newborns. The results indicate that PIVKA II levels may be more useful as a predictor of late bleeding than a blood clotting test because the lower levels of pre-treatment VKDB are less sensitive to the effects of low concentrations of these factors. This suggests that early prophylactic treatment of infants at birth will prevent late bleeding. A daily dose of 25g orally is as effective for prophyluscular prophylaxes as an initial dose of 1m after birth for breastfed babies. Two studies have been conducted: first, a new prepared mixed Micellar preparation was prepared; and second, another study was performed on healthy breastfed children. Thirteen babies received either 1m orally or 2m permuscularly during their first eight weeks of life. These studies suggest that IVK prophyllaxis should be required for all newly born infants.

One of the most important of these is the link with unintended pregnancy , followed by age , socio-economic and ethnic group .
Integrated campaigns can increase the use of folic acid supplements to some extent .
Research trials indicated that : ( i ) printed re sources and the mass media used in isolation are not effective in the longer term ; and ( ii ) health-care-based initiatives can be effective and are more likely to be successful if they include making supplements easily available .
Campaigns and interventions have the potential to exacerbate socio-economic inequalities in folic acid use .
However , even high- quality campaigns that increase use result in under half of women in the target group taking supplements","In this paper, we examine the relationship between knowledge of the ""correct message"" for pregnant women and their consumption of folate in Australia. Women who are aware of the right message before pregnancy are more likely to take adequate amounts of folicul acid from food than women who have not been informed about the correct message. We conclude that preconception counseling is an effective strategy for preventing birth defects because it can be done early during pregnancy. However, many women do not know when they will become pregnant or whether they will need to consult with their general physician. This study further investigates the effect of pre-conceceptional advice on maternal health by examining the frequency of women's awareness of the association among folate and nervous tube defects. The results indicate that women who were unaware at first of the correct messages were much less likely to be concerned about the information than those who were not. A community-randoped controlled trial has been conducted to assess the efficacy of a public education campaign to raise awareness of folic acid in women of lower social class. Pregnant women received a letter from their personal doctor asking them to give an invitation to attend pre-birth consultation. When asked, most women returned the invitation; only 11 % did not want to receive an invitation.

TRA had no influence on lifestyle behaviour .
Conclusions There is limited evidence , of low overall quality , suggesting a possible lack of effectiveness of TRA in reducing CVD events and mortality , as well as a clinical ly insignificant influence on individual risk factor levels .","In this paper, we present two risk scores for 182 different countries to predict the 10-year risk from blood pressure, age, and a body mass-index score. We use laboratory-based measures of blood pressure and total cholesterol as well as an office-based measure of blood fat. The results indicate that men and women with high risk of heart disease are less likely to die than those with low risk. This is due to the fact that most people in high- income countries have higher risk of death than they do in low- income or middle-class countries. Furthermore, our risk scores provide estimates of the proportion of patients who are at high risk by their country-specified risk factor levels. These estimates vary depending on the population's ethnicity and gender. For example, South Korean women are more likely to be at high risks than European men because of their lower social class. Our risk scores also show that older adults tend to be better at risk than younger adults. A national study has been conducted to develop and validate version of the risk prediction tool, the Qurisket cardiovascular disease risk assessment algorithm, which uses information from routinely collected practice records to calculate the relative risk of each patient. It was found that the risk score improved discrimination between groups of patients when compared with other risk factors such as self-assigned ethnicity, age; sex; smoking; blood pressure; type 2 diabetes; renal disease; atrial fiillation; and rhematoidic arthritis. Further studies have been performed to evaluate the effect of lifestyle counseling on the 10 years after acute coronary heart attack.

In addition, it reduces fasting glucose by a significant amount. The cost-benefit of the use is evaluated for obese patients. Study 1: To assess whether orlistat can be used as an effective treatment for weight loss over three years after a major change in diet. This study compares the effects of either group on body weight reduction, blood pressure reduction, and lipophosphoprotein levels. It was concluded that orlistate could be more effective than other treatments in reducing fat absorption. Two further studies examine the effect of any combination of lifestyle changes and/or consumption on risk factors for type 2 diabetes. One study uses a double blinded placebo-control trial to evaluate the effcacy of oristat alone with a moderately low-calorie diet. A second study investigates the beneficial effects of adding norlistat to a conventional high-fat diet during weight loss.

INTERPRETATION Our findings suggest that dietary pulse intake significantly reduces LDL cholesterol levels .","In this study, we examine the effects of high fiber diets on body weight loss and lipid profiles. We compare two diets: the ""ha"" diet with no legume consumption, and the ""LG"" diet in order to lower both fasting blood concentrations and low density lipogen-cholestrol levels. Insulin resistant subjects have greater reductions than is normal for men who do not consume any other food. The results suggest that beans may be useful in improving serum lipid profile but does not confer health benefits associated with colon cancer risk. This study shows that bean consumption improves total cholesterol by eight % and reduces the ratio of low-to-highdensity Lipoprotein cholesterol. A novel food ingredient, Lupin flour, has been used as a promising new food source for weight loss. However, studies have shown it to be difficult to use such a highly enriched diet because of its high glyceride content. Thus, here we present a comparison between a conventional wheat-bread diet and a lenticl-enriched bread diet. Both diets result in significant changes in body weight, composition, and blood pressure. For example, there is a significant decrease in plasma lipoprotein LDL-c after the lenticular-enriched diet; however, these changes are not significant enough to prevent heart disease.",0.9696812866140554

Summary Exercise has moderate-to-large effects on muscle strength , body composition , physical functioning and inflammation in older adults .","This study focuses on the effect of short-term eccentric resistance training on older adults' muscle mass. Forty elderly women were assigned to an old-aged group, which was divided into two groups: the control group and the training group. The subjects underwent 12 weekly resistance training twice per week with no specific intervention. Both groups showed significant increases in knee extension 1mm at 24 pg. ; timed up and go test, stairsclimbing tests, and chair rising test. However, there was no difference between groups. In conclusion, the strategy that increasing the exposure times at the eccentric stage of movement using different volumes and intensity does do not promote different adapts in strength nor functional capacity comparing to conventional resistancetraining in elderly woman. A trial is presented for older people who are at risk of falling. It compares three types of exercise training: 1) endurance training 2) balance training 3) and 4) high-repetitive resistance training. Young subjects outperform older adults in their leg power and body composition. They also show greater gains in bone formation than they do in muscles. Two studies have been conducted regarding falls risk in older people. One investigates the influence of ""vertical vibration"" and ""side-alternating-vibration"" training on hip and body mineral denitrance and other health factors in older adults. These studies suggest that both training strategies may improve bone mineral dentition and fat mass in older men. Another study examines the effects of eight-week resistance training without visual Feedback on balance and muscular strength in older patients. After 8 weeks, all subjects experienced improvements in lean bodies mass, upper and low body strength, and dynamic powers.

The side effects are less severe than those caused by the other two drugs. A double-blinded, six-weekdouble-blind cross-sectional study compares the efficacious and safety of paroixetine with fluoxetine; no significant differences are found between treatment groups. Both treatments improve on measures of depressive severity but do not show any significant change in weight loss or gain. Two studies examine second-generation drug use in the Italian mental health care system. Seven cases of patients receiving off label prescribing for second generation antipsychotic medicines were collected. These patients included a total of twenty-five patients who were treated, either from hospital or outpatient services. They were assigned to eight weekly doses of parodytine or flicitate medication. At the end of each treatment, patients improved their scores on Hamilton Depression Rating scale, which was similar to the Hamilton Rating Score for Major Depressive Disorder. Venlafranine Xr was superior to fluoxetin in improving symptoms of major disorder. Although both drugs showed significant improvements on several measures of depression, they did not differ significantly in adverse events.",0.087519014469941

There is a paucity of high- quality evidence regarding changes in dietary intake after LAGB .","The effects of a weight loss diet on body composition, fat mass, and blood-lipids were examined in adult women. In the control group, the diet was divided into two groups: a carbohydrate/protein combination with a higher proportion of protein; and a low-carbogeneous diet with fewer proteins. After six months, the results were more than 90 percent complete. A significant reduction in body weight was observed for both groups. Both groups lost significantly more weight than the other. They also had greater changes in their blood lipid levels and insulin responses to meal challenges. This study concludes that replacing some dietary carbohydrates by protein may improve weight loss and increase the proportion of subject achieving 'a clinically relevant weight lose'.",0.9665962513476611

Conclusions An SPPB score lower than 10 is predictive of all-cause mortality .
The systematic implementation of the SPPB in clinical practice setting s may provide useful prognostic information about the risk of all-cause mortality .","In this study, we examine the relative risk of mortality among older adults who are physically active. For every 1,000 steps walking per day, there is a significant reduction in the risk of death for those with poor physical performance. The results suggest that physical activity can be used to predict future disease and illness. Acutely ill elderly patients receive a Short Physical Performance battery as a measure of their health status at the time of their discharge. After they return to normal health, they have a greater chance of regaining their health after hospitalization than do patients with better physical performance scores. This suggests that older patients may be at higher risk of developing new diseases. Women with good mobility tend to have more risks of dying than those with weaker or less-than-good mobility. These women also have lower risk of all causes of death when compared to men with worse physical performance Scores. We investigate the association between short physical performance and cardiac dysfunction in an elderly population of Russian patients. It is found that both these factors are independent predictionors of overall mortality. Furthermore, it has been shown that reduced physical performance is associated with increased mortality in HIV-informed patients.

There is no evidence that diet-derived acid load is deleterious for bone health .
Thus , insufficient dietary protein intakes may be a more severe problem than protein excess in the elderly .","In this paper, the authors examine the relationship between a diet of high-quality dairy products and hip fracture. They conclude that women who eat more than 95g per day have an increased risk for hip fracture in comparison to women who consume less than 69g per week. The results suggest that higher levels of dairy consumption may reduce bone mineral loss. A study is performed on 144,580 females aged 50-79 years at the Women's health initiative. It finds that there is no significant association between food frequency questionnaires and fracture risk. There are no differences in biomarker values of bone turnover or changes in serum Iglum-I levels. However, it is found that increasing protein intake increases bone mineral density.

We conclude that there is strong evidence for syphilis in patients with an idly but uncomplicated form of alcoholism; however, our results suggest that it is possible that some genetic instruments may be stronger than those used for schizophrenia. This paper also discusses the role of cannabis in treating mental illness. Although several papers have suggested that chronic use disorders may lead to worse symptoms, studies have been inconsistent. For example, one study suggests that Culovirinal cannabinol might improve symptoms in patients who have a severe psychosis. A second study uses a double blinded placebo-controlled approach to assess the influence of long-term use of cannanbidiol on the severity of psychological symptoms in people at high risk of becoming ill. The effect of cannication on brain function was studied in a large sample of healthy subjects. After two years, the effects were observed in terms of changes in verbal learning, anxiety, and sleep. These changes were associated with increases in the frequency of both early and late-onset drug use. Furthermore, these changes were seen as being related to increased risk of experiencing psychotic symptoms. Finally, using a genetic analysis, we found out that most of the major riskfactors for psychoses are highly suggestive: ethnic minority in Low ethnic Density area, second generation immigrant, trait Anhedonia, premorbad IQ / minor physical anomalities, and Olfactory Identification ability. Thus, all of these factors seem to be implicated in the pathogenesis of adult psychotics.",0.18878101585076715

The first was a single-blind, placebo-control trial conducted in 66 14 elderly patients aged 76.1 years or older. They were assigned to receive either a diurestic regimen or a Calcium Channel blocker. After three years, blood pressure improved significantly in the active treatment group. The second study examined the efficaciousness of newer antihytertensive medicines in elderly people. Although there was no difference in bloodpressure reduction among the four different drugs, the main endpoint was fatal or notfatal stroke. There were only minor differences in primary end points when compared to the other two treatment groups. The third study looked at the association between blood pressure and major cardiovascular events in old patients with isolated sickle hypertension.

The results are compared with those obtained from three different types of teeth: human, Bovine, and Porine. They conclude that there are no significant differences in bond strength between enamel and dentine. However, they do note that porcine teeth present a different distribution of pearl prisms than human teeth. Post-opportunity sensitivity may be due to restorative techniques rather than the type of selfetching adhesive used.

Methylpheni date , dexamfetamine and mixed amfetamine formulations all showed beneficial effects on children ’s on-task behaviour and academic work completion .
These review findings suggest that medication for ADHD has the potential to improve children ’s learning and academic achievement","In this paper, Anderson focuses on two telephone surveys conducted between April 18, 2003 and May 11th, 2003 to collect population, educational, employment, and income. The results of these surveys indicate that the average household income is significantly lower among adults with attention deficit disorder in comparison to controls. Although there are no significant differences in academic performance or personal characteristics among individuals with both types of disorder, the loss of individual income for adults with ADHD is estimated between $67bn and $116bn. This study examines the effect of behaviormodification and two dosesof methylphenis date on classroom behavior as well as academic performance of children with hyperactivity disorder. Both treatment groups show significant improvements in school performance and improvement in health-related measures. However, it is not possible to explain why longer-term academic treatments have not been found. Two studies investigate the effects of methylphini date on attention-dificit/hypteractivity disorder; one compares short-acting preparations of MethYLPH and another compares immediate-release formulations of MH and Convenient.

Adverse effects were minimally reported .
There is little evidence of serious short-term adverse effects in these trials , but they are underpowered to detect rare adverse effects .
REVIEW ER 'S CONCLUSIONS Recombinant human growth hormone ( hGH ) doses between 0.3 - 0.375 mg/kg/wk increase short-term growth in girls with Turner Syndrome ( TS ) by approximately 3 cm in the first year of treatment and by approximately 2 cm per year after 2 years of treatment .
There is little evidence on the effects of hGH on final height .","In this paper, we present the results of a two-year study on the effects of growth hormone treatment on adult height in patients who have Turner's syndrome. The first study was published in 1983 and is followed by a second study in which girls with Turner Syndrome are treated with either hg or ox plus rolone at an appropriate dose for their age. After two more years, the results are presented in a long-term Canadian multicentre prospective study. Girls receive hGH for three to six years and show a rapid increase in growth rates. There is a significant relationship between the higher rate of growth and the girls' perceptions that they are ""more intelligent, more attractive, having more friendships, greater popularity, and experiencing less tension than the untreatment group"". This study concludes that both regimens work well in terms of height gain and improvement in bone maturity. For example, when subjects receive a daily dose of hippopotamin, they achieve a height velocity that is nearly twice the height predicted by Bayley-paneau. However, after several years of treatment, the height velocity increases significantly. Finally, the final height gain is not as high as expected because of the younger age and slower bone maturation. A further study has been carried out in nineteen girls with Type 2 Turner Syndrome aged 11 years. Thirteen girls had reached final height above their predicted adult height.",0.9949732767169724

Meta-regression found some , limited , evidence that effect sizes decreased as post-intervention follow-up period and incentive value increased .
However , the latter effect may be confounded by the former .
The available evidence suggests that financial incentive interventions are more effective than usual care or no intervention for encouraging healthy behaviour change .","In this study, we examine the effects of contingent reinforcement on smoking behavior. We find that payment groups show lower levels of carbon monoxidation than no incentive groups; however, some subjects in those payment groups fail to reduce Carbon monoxide sufficiently to contact reinforcers.

A prior study reported that financial incentives were more effective in increasing the rate of smoking reduction among drug-using workers. This study compares the effects by monetary vs nonmonetary incentives on return for Tuberculoses skin test reading and determines the prevalence of tuberculiin infection in this samples. Although these studies have not been directly based on worksite smoking habits, they do suggest that there may be additional risk factors involved in improving quit rates. For example, pregnant women who attend a WIC program often fall prey to tobacco cessation because they receive publicly subsidized care. Two approaches to treating smoking are used: 1) social support and 2) rewards for positive behavior change. These include reward-based motivational education or self-help instruction. Both methods increase the frequency of testing for TB but do not lead to significant increases in the number of patients quitting smoking.",0.35046593760113476

Muscle spasticity seemed to have a negative impact on bone integrity in the paretic upper limb , but its influence on bone properties in the paretic lower limb was uncertain .
Substantial bone changes in the paretic limbs occurred particularly in the first few months after stroke onset .
Early intervention , muscle strength training , and long-term management strategies may be important to enhance bone health post-stroke .","In this study, we investigate the effects of combined therapy with body weight- supported treadmill training on gait recovery in stroke patients. Thirteen stroke patients were included and compared to control subjects who did not receive any physical activity or motor control during their first day of stroke. Bone loss was observed within 6 months after stroke; better motor control and greater walking ability were associated with reductions in bone loss. A further study is presented wherein it is shown that improved motor control leads to less bone loss at 6 months. The results indicate that better motor controls and walking recovery are associated with reduced bones loss. Muscle strength is impaired in people with stroke. Time-degrading properties of muscle are also altered but have been found to be independent from one other. Stroke may lead to increased fracture risks because of weak bodies or an increase in the risk of falling. This study uses two complementary strategies to determine fracture risk: 1) veterans who suffered a stroke were at higher risk of fracture than other elderly people; and 2) patients with intermediate functional limitations were more likely to suffer a fracture than those with mild or severe impairments. These studies will help prevent future fractures for stroke patients as well as for older patients living with chronic stroke.",0.957771331688966

A patient's score could be used as a predictor of whether or not they will survive after initial treatment. In this study, we assess the efficability of weekly gemcitebine followed by erylotinibe at disease progression in elderly people with diffuse largeB cell lymphomas.

The results indicate that greater adherence with the Mediterranean diet reduces total mortality, but there is an inverse association between higher adherence and greater mortality due to both heart disease and cancer. Consequences In this study, greater adherence to the Mediterranean has been associated by a lower all-caluse mortality. Study 1:BACKGROUNT Greater adherence does not seem to have any significant effect on overall mortality.

However, it is unclear whether the use of this drug can be associated with increased risk of heart failure. The results of a double blinded trial in which patients were given digoxin for 12 weeks or switched to placebo showed that they had worsening left ventricular function. In addition, the patients who received digoxiin had lower quality of life scores, reduced eject fractions, and increased heart rate. These results suggest that the withdrawing of dignox carries considerable dangers for patients with severe heart failure and impertinent sytolic function. A study was conducted in which 684 patients were assigned either to continue takingdigoxin or to switch to placebo. After two years, there was no difference in the overall mortality or all cause mortality between the digoxiniz group and the no-dipoxin group. For the main outcome, the cumulative incidence was 13.4 p.m. vs 12.3.4 %; unadadjusting hazardration was 0.97 /95 %confidence interval. CI '0.662 - 1.02.

REVIEW ER 'S CONCLUSIONS Calcium supplementation alone has a small positive effect on bone density .
The data show a trend toward reduction in vertebral fractures , but it is unclear if calcium reduces the incidence of non vertebral fractures","In this study, we examine the effect of three different forms of bone loss: 1) a calcium-supplementation group; 2) a placebo-controlled group; and 3) a combination of estrogen andcalcium. The results suggest that it is possible to increase trace mineral intake in older women who are at risk for bone loss. This suggests that there may be an advantage in increasing trace mineral levels in early post menopause. A two-year follow-up study shows that both groups lose significant bone mineral content during the first year but decline significantly in the second year. However, the rate by which bone loss occurs remains constant in the treatment group. Women receive either hormonal replacement therapy or calcium supplementation. Although these regimens have been used before, they do not appear to be as effective as those given by other methods. We compare the efficaciousness of calcium augmenter in early Postmenopause against calcium augmentation Plus hormonal replacement Therapy and with placebo. All women were recruited between 6 month and 6 years later after a normal period of menopatra's absence. They were assigned to three separate groups: 1) hormonal replacement -- progesteron-calcium Carbonate -- 2) calcium carbonate -- or 3, placebo. Each woman had a laboratory history and was provided with a daily dietary history. Calcium was provided as Ca-carbonate, 600 mg per day; and used to supply the diet to estimate a total annual daily allowance of 1700 milligrams of elemental cacific. Bone Mineral Density Measurements At each site were measured using single photon aborptisometry. Total Body Calcium was selected as primary criant for efficaciacy because it measures Mass rather than Dense Per Unit area. It measures mass instead of dense per unit area. The mean rate of change on bone mineral values for each condition was calculated for every woman at each site. The rateof change in bone minerals for each conditions was calculated according to both raw numbers and percentages.

The results are similar to those obtained in other studies: pain intensity is greater in the exercise group at 6 weeks than in the advice group at 12 months. A further study suggests that mechanical traction may be more effective in treating neck pain in patients who have signs of cervical radicular disease. This study also uses a prediction rule to predict which group of patients likely will respond to mechanical treatment. It concludes that both groups show significant improvement in pain, function, and disability over time. Neck pain is an important cause of pain and limitation in workers. Neck injuries are frequently associated with complex relationships between individuals and workplace riskfactors. Neck discomfort is particularly common in women because of their high social support and poor physical capacity. Neck problems are often caused by complex relationships among individual and workplace risks factors.

Children who respond to both treatments do not show significant improvement in their symptoms over time. However, they suggest that more children can be treated with combined treatment. The results of this study are described in two studies: first, an investigational drug called atomomexetine has been used as potential treatment against attention-deficit/hyperactivité disorder; and second, a report on the use of a practical clinical trial model in Psychiatry.

Cannabidiol ( CBD ) is not psychoactive but plays a modulating role on cannabis psychoactive effects .
The proportion of 9-THC in plant material is higher ( up to 40 % ) than in other cannabinoids ( up to 9 % ) .
Conclusions Findings reveal that 9-THC contributes the most to cannabis psychoactivity .
Due to lower psychoactive potency and smaller proportions in plant material , other psychoactive cannabinoids have a weak influence on cannabis final effects .","In this first study, the effects of different cananabinolics on the subjective and psychimetric effects of cigarette smoking are investigated. The subjects were assigned to either low or high concentrations of canbidiol or cannabic chlorinum. They were asked to perform various tasks in front of a blinded mirror. Their performance was measured by EEG and event-retrieval potential. When compared to placebo, they found that active THC cigars produced expected effects upon mood, behavior, and brain activity. However, when varying the concentrations did not change their subjects' responses on all of the outcome measure. These findings confirm previous studies suggesting that THC is the primary active ingredient of marijuana. Acute memory functions are not known but the time course for functional impairments remains unclear. Although some aspect of memory functions may be acutely affected by  9tetrahidrocannabonol, effects on others aspects of memory have not yet been known. This study aims to detail the sudden acute and residual effects of both 9tetrical and non-toxic compounds in infrequent male cannabis users. After four exposure days, the patients were divided into two groups: one group had a higher dose of THC than the other; each group had slower response time, faster learning, and more rapid motor control. Both groups showed marked differences in their ability to memorize short-term memories. While there were no significant differences between these two drugs, community-based studies suggested that CBN and CBD were particularly dangerous for mental health. Furthermore, laboratory-based experiments suggest that CBD and THC could be administered in purity under controlled conditions. Thus, it is necessary to know whether there is pronounced relationship between THC dosage and TAC serum concentration.",0.9874479530036534

HighlightsCurrent low back pain assessment relies on subjective measures .Use of objective measures ( kinematics/kinetics ) is encouraged in low back pain assessment .This review highlights the heterogeneity of studies with low back pain and healthy subjects .","The effect of back pain on the lumbro spine and hip joints during everyday activities is unknown. A three dimension real time electromagnetic tracking device is used to track movements of the two regions in subjects with or without low back pain. Lumbar spine-hip joint coordination was considerably altered in subjects who had back pain, particularly those with'straight leg raise signs'. In this study, we investigate whether people with lower back pain reduce variability of motion between the pelvics and torso in the transversal plane during gaits at different speeds than healthy controls. Thirteen patients with lowback pain and twelve healthy volunteers participate in the study. They are divided into four groups: 1) patients with unilateral low backpain; 2) patients with non-specific LBP; and 3) healthy subjects. This study uses a modified logistic regression model to predict the relative performance of trunk motion and kinomematics in standing and sitting positions.

The glycemic impact of NNS consumption did not differ by type of NNS but to some extent varied by participants ’ age , body weight , and diabetic status .
Conclusions NNS consumption was not found to elevate blood glucose level .","The present study investigates the extent of expectedancy in the abilities of glucose to improve memory performance. After four experimental sessions, subjects are given a sweetener or aspartume for half the time and then they are told that they will receive it when they are asked to do so. This is not true in studies where no sweeteners were used. In this paper, we compare the effects on blood glucose, insulin, and glutcagon- like peptide in elderly subjects who have normal tolerance of glucose. They also examine whether acute hyperglucemia alters fibrinogenolysis in older subjects with normal tolerance. Both subjects show reduced levels of plasma concentrations after either treatment. Acute hyperglycia does not affect fibrinosynthesis in elderly patients. However, there is some evidence that artificial sweetening can increase GLP-1 Secretion in humans. Thirty male subjects take part in two experiments: 1) drinking carbonated water before a meal; 2) drinking sugar substitutes; and 3) eating sweetened foods. All three treatments lead to greater energy consumption than sucrose. These results suggest that artificialsweeteners may be more effective in reducing blood glucose in people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.",0.9155300578076574

The results indicate that there is no significant difference in the clinical survival of the two strategies over time. Although both strategies are more successful at three years, they do not differ significantly in terms of anatomic form, marginal adaptation, and discoloration.

The results are that there are 29 acute cruciateligan injuries during the season and that those who comply with the program reduce their risk of injury by one half. In elite divisions, the risk for injury is reduced among those whom complete the intervention program. This study shows how it is feasible to prevent these injuries with specific nervemuscular training. Study 1: Pretest/posttest designs; controlled single- group pretest or posttest design; two-way analyzers; and six-month balance training program. Results show that subjects improve stability in both lower limbs but not in either direction. Conclusions A 6-week home-based balanced training program was designed to decrease the rate of ankle injuries in healthy young female players. Students were divided into two groups: the intervention group received daily exercises and the control group received only wobble boards. Both groups showed significant improvement in balance ability after 6 weeks. They also reported that they had fewer injuries when compared to controls.

It shows that a trial is feasible but only unless patients were recruited across United Kingdom Study 1:seasonal affective disease is characterizedby recurrent minor depressive episodes occurring during the falland / or winter months that year. Therefore, bright light should be given early in the spring to prevent depressed symptoms from developing into major depressive episode. However, it is found that these patients are more likely to have recurring major depressors than those who stop treatment earlier in the winter. Thus, over time, the diagnoses changed for better in 64 percent of the patients. Furthermore, SAD is a type of relapsing depression that occurs annually at the exact time each year. There is little evidence that long-term exposure to light reduces the risk of depressive repeats in the following winter.

In multiple trials , these patients have shown clinical benefit from atrial fibrillation ablation including improved left ventricular systolic function , quality of life , and clinical heart failure symptoms .
SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation ablation in heart failure patients remains well tolerated with an overall efficacy comparable to atrial fibrillation ablation in patients without heart failure .
There is consistent evidence for the clinical benefit of atrial fibrillation ablation in heart failure patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and limited evidence for atrial fibrillation ablation in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction .
Currently , there is insufficient data regarding the safety and efficacy of left atrial appendage closure devices in heart failure patients","In patients with persistent heart failure, a direct current cathter ablation procedure is considered the best way to restore left ventricular functio. The results of this ablation are reported in three studies: 1) small single-centre studies suggest that atrial fibrillation can improve valor function; 2) large-scale studies attempt to determine whether catheter ablation may be more effective than pharmacical therapy; and 3) larger-scale trials aim to verify the safety andefficacy of plenial vein isolation in patients with severe congesive heart failure.

In this study, the results are similar to those seen in split-mouth designs. A significant difference in attachment level gain and bone depth after treatment with Emdogain was observed at 8 months. The present clinical trial compares the long- term effect of Emedoain as an adjunct for modified flap surgery with the effects of MWf and placebo treatment. Both groups achieve improved gains in terms of pocket depth reduction, attachment level increase, and bone volume. However, there is no evidence of any adverse effects from use of EmDoain together with Periodontal surgery. Two different surgical procedures are described: 1) guided tissue regeneration with enamel matrix debridment; 2) open flap debradement; and 3) implanted collagen derivative. All three methods result in improvements in probing pocket deepening, pocket depth loss, and height of attachment levels.

Second, we investigate the effect of group-baseline differences in recurrent treatments on muscle function, functional performance, balance, body composition, and muscle thickness in men receiving orrogen Deprivations. Third, we describe a lifestyle intervention designed to improve the health of overweight fathers. We conclude that it is possible to use social cognitive theory to increase physical activity behavior but that there is no significant difference in step counts from baseline to follow-up. Finally, we discuss a trial using a distance medicine-based program to improve physical activity in older women with breast orprostatecancer.",0.2015579682986056
30712238,Conclusion It can be concluded that bone remodeling occurs after tooth extraction and immediate implant installation,"In this study, the authors describe the healing of a number of minor defects in immediate implanted bovine bone. They report that there are no significant differences between the groups and that mucosals recede significantly after 6 months. The results suggest that biooss reduces the risk of mucousal recession by avoiding an immediate extraction socket. This paper also discusses the use of cone-bearm computed tommography to assess the depth of the facial Alveolar Bone Wall. It is suggested that for most patients, adjunctive bone augmentation might be needed when placing implants in area of ethetic concern.

30215045,Conclusions The use of prophylactic antibiotics is effective for reducing the incidence of SSI and superficial SSI but is not effective for preventing deep SSI in low-risk patients who underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy,"In this paper, the authors present a large population-based registry study of elective surgery in order to determine whether or not prophylactics are effective in preventing superficial and deep surgical site infections. They conclude that they have no significant effect on these complications. Although r and Omized controls could possibly show an improvement in the risk of postoppressive infectious complications not detected in this study, such reduction must be weighted against the risks of promoting resistance by widespread use of paternal antibiotics. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficability of antibiotics in patients who undergo laparoscopiccholecychstectomy. Antibiotics do not seem to reduce the rate of infection after surgery; however, it does not seem necessary for those who receive them. Acute calculustitis is the most frequently complicated complication due to laparotic choleclasis. There is little evidence regarding the utility of prophylusitic antibiotics in treating low-risk acute calculous disease. However, many surgeons continue to use regimens of cephalospoin as prophylaxaxis.",0.018734516686216333

They propose that workers should be given regular rest breaks to prevent work-related Upper Extremity Syndromes. Workers are assigned either an ergonomic intervention group or a combination exercise and job stress management group. After two years of post-work injury, they report reduced risks of work injuries, lost time injuries, and total lost days. A participatory team is formed in order to improve employee health and safety. The results indicate that there is no significant difference in pain severity between groups for any outcome measure. This study compares three countries: Norway, Poland, and the United States. Three groups of Norwegian women were assigned to one group of ergonomics training, while the other group was assigned to another group of physical training. Both groups showed improvement in neck pain, shoulder pain, and upper arm pain. These differences do not change over time. However, both groups reported less sick days after the intervention than during their pre-and post-intervention periods. Two studies have been conducted on back pain; one examines a program designed to reduce complaints by using a system of exercises and educational tools. The first study investigates the effect of a series of exercises on patients who suffer from neck pain.

Postoperative morbidities develop in 196 patient groups; there are 165 cases of operation related complications and 153 cases of respiratory/ cardiovascular complications. Mortality rates were highest in patients without preexistation vascular disease nor with insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus. After radical surgery, however, the risks were comparable to those of total pancreachectomy and double bypasses. Short-term post-operative glucose concentrations ranged from 12 to 352mg/dl, divided into qualid 1, 121 to 206mg per liter, 2 207 to 229mg diabetic, and 3 230 to 252mmol per  Liter. When blood concentrations reached 200mg daily, they were at an increased risk of infection. Physicians must consider a target of 200 mg/Dl to prevent short-term infection.",0.9783300306562449

Conclusions Chronic intra-uterine opioid exposed infants and pre-school children experienced no significant impairment in neurobehavioral outcomes when compared to non-exposed peers , although in all domains there was a trend to poorer outcomes .","This study focuses on the relationship between birth weight and performance on gambling tasks. It finds that there is a significant association between height and performance at age two, but the extent of this association decreases as the age progresses. In addition, it shows that socioenvironmental changes are important in children's mental health. A cohort of drug-mimusing mothers has been studied for their abnormal visual evokedas. The results indicate that infants born with drug-exposed mothers have an increased risk of developing abnormalities during their first year of pregnancy. Furthermore, patients who receive opiate substitute treatment have a greater chance of survival than those who do not receive such treatment. Thus, further research is needed regarding the effect of duration of morphines on long-term mortality.",0.9222160624878393

Conclusion Psychotropic medication non-adherence was high .
It was influenced by various factors operating at different levels .","In this study, we examine the predictor of patient- and disease-related characteristics that may lead to nonadherence to treatment in patients with Major depression. The results suggest that certain patient-and illness-related features may increase the risk of unadherence. This study focuses on two specific sub-sub-obsessions: 1) patients with severe mental illnesses who are not adherent to their treatment; and 2) patients who have other medical conditions that might be associated with higher risk of failure. These include alcohol dependence, youth, greater affective Morbidity, various side effects, and recovering from hypomania.

After two weeks of placebo runs, they were given either one or two doses of depressin. They showed a significant improvement in their nocturnals and urine volume after three weeks of treatment. There was little evidence of systemic complications during medication. The aim of this trial was to determine whether desmopsin is effective in treating nocturius in elderly men with prostatichypoplasia. Eighteen women with a confirmed multiple disease were enrolled into the study. After 1, 3, 6, and 12 month of treatment, all patients maintained flow volume charts and used diary entries to record quodal data throughout the experiment.

Conclusions Shorter secondary prevention programmes , those based in general practice , and those staffed by generalists are at least as effective in reducing all cause mortality in patients with coronary heart disease as longer programmes , hospital-based programmes , and programmes staffed by specialists","In this overview, the authors present a number of studies on the benefits of physical exercise after anocardial myocardiation. The most important is one that showed a significant reduction in total and cardiovascular death, sudden death, and fatal or nonfatal repeat-coronary atherosis over three years. This study also shows that patients with coronarry heart disease who are not assigned to usual medical care have improved their risk factor scores significantly. However, there is no difference in the rate of improvement in the minimal size of diseased segment between the two treatment groups. For example, for patients with stable chest pain, it is found that they lose more than five percent of their lesion size during the course of the trial. A second study suggests that a monthly check-in program may improve survival among men and women recovering from myomyosclerotic diseases. It is shown that these programs reduce the severity of the disease by improving blood pressure, body mass, and health-regarding quality of life as well as improvements in psychological distress. These studies do not warrant routine implementation of such programs; instead, they suggest that nurses run preventive clinics can be used to improve patient health. Two further studies examine the effects of nurse run prevention services on patients with severe acute myotomy. One group uses a combination of home-based cardial rehabilitation and lifestyle changes to help patients manage their symptoms. Another study compares outpatient cardiac rehab to regular care in patients with moderately severe coronary disease.

All nursing home residents were eligible except for those with syphilis, a terminal disease that prevented contact. ADL scores declined significantly in both groups. Both groups showed significant reductions in functional decline. A facility wide nursing rehabilitation program could play a valuable role in reducing functional decline by helping residents to keep their involvement in broad spectrum of activities. This is accomplished through the use of ""Full-time Equivalence"" exercise training. It was designed to improve strength, balance, mobility, and function. In addition, it was tailored to meet the need of both high as well as low mobility residents. After four months of exercise, significant improvements were made in mobility, balance; gait, agility, and functional capacity. Conclusions With both interventions, facilities were capable ofimplementing a broadbased intervention that results in a substantial reduction in Adel decline rates.

The Berg Balance scale is more reliable than the Pass for patients with severe neuromusculosis at the onset of stroke; however, it does not show any significant floor effect or ceiling effect. This study furthermore compares the incidence and casefatality rates of stroke in Europe to those in the United States. Stroke occurs in different parts of the world: England has the highest rate of stroke among all age groups, Dijon has the lowest rate of fatality, and London has the largest number of strokes. There are also differences in the severity of stroke between countries. A patient's gait speed is measured as a measure of function during a post-stroke recovery period. It is determined that people with sub acute stroke experience an improvement in their functional ability. Two different community-dweling older adults who have chronic stroke receive either an agility group or a stretching group.

Women who receive either of these regimens lose more lean soft-tissue mass than do women who receive no treatment. The results of this study suggest that exercise training may improve the effects of hormonal replacement therapy on weight changes, body composition, and bone Mass in early postmanopausalsal women. This study uses a population-based sample of 681 women from the Women's Health initiative who were assigned to control, exercise, HRT, exercise + Hr, and exercise with Hr. After 5 years, there was a significant increase in body weight in each group. There was an increase in trunk fat mass as a consequence of a greater gain in fat; however, neither intervention prevented any change in body composition aftermenopause. Menopause causes increases in fat masses and loss of Lean Body Mass. However, these changes in bodies composition are not preventted by Hormonal Replacement Therapy. Sarcopiens may be diagnosed in the clinic according to different performance-based définitions. In this paper, we examine the effect of low-dose estrogen/progestin combination on muscle mass, strength, and endurance in community older women.

22963896,CONCLUSIONS This systematic review provides evidence for the efficacy of both SSRIs and TCAs in the treatment of chronic depression and showed a better acceptability of SSRIs,"A double- blinded, placebo-control study comparing sertraline to imipramin in treating patients with primary depressive disorder. In this study, the effects of a single dose of fluoxetine are shown to be more effective than those of other antidepressedants. The results suggest that fluoxetine may be more cost effective than paroxentine for improving symptoms in older adults with minor depression. Two studies examine the effectiveness of acute and maintenance treatment for chronic depression: one focused on major depression currently at a chronic or 2 years' time; and another focused on concurrent DSM-3rd major depression with simultaneously DSM-IV-R Dysthmia. Both trials show significant reductions in depressive severity over the 11 week period. Sertralini reduces the functional decline of depression but is not as effective as placebo. Although there is some evidence that serotonine induces changes in the function of the immune system, further studies are needed to determine whether elevated levels of IL1beta can lead to an increased production of circulating IL-1b in patients with severe depression.",0.8406519376385827

They describe a 10-patient trial in which patients are assigned to either a tourquet or a non-torniquet group after receiving written consent. The first muscle biopsy is taken immediately after performing an operation and then the second biopsy is exactly 60 min afterwards. The results show no significant differences in the amount and functions of mitochondria within the muscullus vastus medialyis cells. This suggests that the use of tournizts for TKA does not affect the amount or function of mitochondria inside human skeletal muscles.

Level of evidence: I; Prospective R and Omized controlled study 1: Lactate levels tend to be increasingly used to govern resucitation efforts. Lactate values are drawn per hospital procedure without a tripniquet. There is no difference in lactate levels for every patient. Conclusions These findings suggest that currently practice s should be changed. Proposal 2: Postericanation has been shown to improve marksmanship in fire situations. Although some studies have suggested that it may be beneficial to use tourniquet devices on the dominant arm, these studies do not demonstrate any effect on histology or injury.

The results indicate that the intervention is more effective than controls in several domains of health: sleep quality, anxiety, state anxiety, blood pressure, and physical activity. These results suggest that meditation may be useful for improving older women with Relapsed Lilliput Syndrome. This study also shows that dopaminergic release during meditation is associated with reduced desire for action. It is further reported that there is a positive relationship between increased brain glutamateric levels and improved mood and anxiety. Furthermore, it is suggested that doing so causes a suppressed corticosteric glutamatesive transmission. Type 2 diabetes has become epidemic in Asia because of rapid urbanization, nutrition transition, and increasing physical activity levels. A number of studies have shown that diet and lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of developing Type 2 disease.

The results show that there is no significant change in bone turnover after 12 weeks. Postmenopaual women are assigned to four different categories: those who have no falls; those who had a single fall without serious injuries; those with two or more falling without serious injury; and those who were at least one fallen causing severe injury. A total population of 133 patients has long-term hospitalizations due to falls. Walking is associated with reduced risk of admission to nursing homes for three groups: those with no falls, those with only one fall without seriously injury, and those whom have at least an injury causing serious damage. This group also has a higher risk of getting into a nursing house than the other two groups. Although some studies have suggested that walking may improve health, these studies have not yet been published. Menopause induces rapid declines in body mineral density, aerobic fitness, muscle strength, and balance, especially in older women.

Children with conduct problems are at greater risk for criminality in childhood and repeat offending in adulthood. Although both drugs are clinically effective, they are often associated with unwanted effects more often than with placebo. This study examines the relationship between behavior disorder and criminality among children age 5.2 to 11 years. Adolence is predicted later by criminality and serious anti social behavior in aging. Both drugs are associated with increased risks for becoming an adults offender in youth and adulthood; child conduct problems predict later criminality as well as serious antisocial behaviors in ages 18 to 23. Prior research indicates ""conduct disorder"" is associated with comorbid mental illnesses but does not appear to be particularly common in the United States. However, studies have suggested that conduct disorder may be associated with other psychological disorders such as mood or substance use disorder. Lithiium Carbonate has been shown to reduce aggression in children who have conduct disorder. It also improves their motor movement, off- task behavior, and emotional changes. Rispurdone appears superior to placebo when compared to molindone in treating aggressiveness and depression in children with ODD.

It is reported that early treatment can reduce delayed onset soreness by as much as 24 hours. However, it does not improve range of motion immediately after exercise. The study also examines changes in muscle damage after eccentric exercise. In this study, eighteen men perform repeated eccentric exercises of the elbow muscles separated by fourteen days at an angular speed of 30 o'clock. After two weeks, the results are similar for both groups. Protease supplements seem to increase muscle strength losses during eccentric exercise by regulation of inflammation. Acupunture and antioxidants have been used to help attenuates muscle injury and restore muscle function in resistance trained people. Thirt thirty-six untrained males were assigned to either no prior exercise, placebo, prior exercise with antioxidants, prior excoriation, prior eccentric exercise, prior fatigue, blood protein Carbonyls/peroxides, and time main effects. No groupby time interactions were noted; however, there were no groupbytime interactions between any variable.

Conclusion This study suggests that GB may provide better radiographic and clinical outcomes than MR when used to determine mechanical rotation in TKAs","The two surgical strategies for total knee replacement are described in this paper. First, a technique called ""measured resection"" is used to guide the bone into the proper position before surgery and second, an approach called ""gap-balancing,"" uses equal ligament tensions to restore the joint line. In this paper, we compare the results of both approaches on the joints: they show that the gap technique increases the post-opportunity when compared against the measured rsection technique; however, there is no difference in the pre-opertificence of the joint lines between the two methods. Finally, we conclude that it is preferable to use a distal implant rather than a st or ard implant as these devices tend to have greater dimensions. This paper also discusses how patient-specific instruments can improve the accurateness of the surgeon's rotational alignment by using the concept of their system. It was our intention that PSI could improve the accuracyof the rotational alignment in TKA because the concept had the potential to explicitly identify pre-operatingly during planningthe classical anatomical l andmarks that serve as reference to set up therotal alignment for each patient.

It is designed to improve their behavior by using play, praise, and rewards as well as harsh discipline. The results are quite different from those of control children. Children with both types of disorder show significant psychological and educational burdens at follow up. In contrast, children with only one type of disorder respond better to either treatment. A study in which fifty children with the disorder were randomed to a 10-week treatment of ""methylphenidate"" or to an 18-month treatment of multimodified behavior therapy showed that there was no difference in outcome between the two groups. However, when anxiety and high IQ were added to the predictors, they predicted worse outcomes after three years. Both treatments had similar effects on children's behavior but did not affect parent-reported externalizing behavior. Parents reported greater self-control and increased parental satisfaction than did children with other disorders. These studies suggest that parents can be more effective in treating children with ADHD because they do not need any additional training. They also report that parents receive improved parenting skills during the first half of the treatment period.

A large efficacious and safety trial was conducted to determine whether feeding an isocaloric, nutritant-enriched predischarge formulation would reverse postdiggeral growth deficits without adverse safety outcome. Two hundred eightey-four premature infants received either a protein, energy, mineral, andmicronutrient-enriched postdischarce formula or an isostearic, nutrients-enrichedpreterm formula. At 9 months, they were heavier and longer than the control group; there was no difference in head circumference. After 6 weeks, exclusively breastfet infants were now 513g, lighter and 1.7cm shorter than the controls. Preterm children do not need any additional nutrition during their first nine months.",0.9935967112704549

Conclusion : This meta- analysis showed that soy products  have weight loss effects , mainly due to soy protein , isoflavone and soy fiber","In this study, the effects of fiber on appetite are examined in overweight adults. The results indicate that soluble fiber is more effective at suppressing hunger than insoluble fiber; however, there is no significant effect on total energy intake. This paper also discusses the use of koujang, a stimulant that has been used to treat various diseases, as an alternative to conventional medicine. It suggests that consumption of whole grain and refined grain products may be associated with weight gain. Although studies have suggested that whole grain or refined grain consumption can reduce body weight, little work has been done on the relation between whole grain consumption and weight gain for American men. A study was conducted among 2708 men aged 40-75 years who were free of known heart disease, cancer, and diabetes from 1984 to 1994. They calculated average weight, body massindex, body fat proportion, and body muscles percentage. After two weeks, they measured their body weight by using multiple models. For every 40g/d change in whole grain consumed, weight gain increased by 0.49kg. Bran added to diet or obtained through fortified grain food further reduced the risks of weight gain but did not increase the risk of losing major weight. Consumption of wholegrain increases the odds of losing big weight. Furthermore, changes in cereal and fruits fiber are inversely connected to weight gain because they are related to the consumption of refined grains. These findings suggest that additional ingredients in whole grains might contribute to beneficial metabolic changes that may reduce large-term weight gains.",0.8557679789759071

Conclusions Specific types of physical activity , total physical activity , and physical activity of at least moderate- to vigorous-intensity were consistently favourably associated with multiple health indicators .","In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to improving physical activity in children. They first describe an intervention that uses a combination of exercise and parent-child interaction to improve motor skills in young children. The results suggest that increased physical activity may lead to improved bone health in younger children. Children are more active during the day when they attend school full-time than on weekdays or on weekends. This suggests that early childhood education is needed to address the importance of physical activity for young children; however, it is not known whether the greater circumference of the tibioal circumference is due to persistent biological bone effects or because of persisting higher activity levels.",0.06541396313462619

Although vitamin D doses were greater than those assessed in the past , we found no new evidence that supplementation could have an effect on most non-skeletal conditions , including cardiovascular disease , adiposity , glucose metabolism , mood disorders , muscular function , tuberculosis , and colorectal adenomas , or on maternal and perinatal conditions .
The compilation of results from 83 trials showed that vitamin D supplementation had no significant effect on biomarkers of systemic inflammation .
The main new finding highlighted by this systematic review is that vitamin D supplementation might help to prevent common upper respiratory tract infections and asthma exacerbations .
There remains little evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplementation has an effect on most conditions , including chronic inflammation , despite use of increased doses of vitamin D , strengthening the hypothesis that low vitamin D status is a consequence of ill health , rather than its cause .
We further hypothesise that vitamin D supplementation could exert immunomodulatory effects that strengthen resistance to acute infections , which would reduce the risk of death in debilitated individuals .","In this study, the authors report that a daily dose of 100 ng. m. d. is associated with improved clinical outcome in patients who have been treated with mycobacteria tuberculoussis. They conclude that it may be insufficient to improve patient's health. A trial was conducted in which pregnant women were given no vitamin D or 150 mL..

Verapamil and HA performed well in single-arm or case-control studies .
Studies of penile traction and vacuum devices in patients with PD demonstrated some benefits in terms of curvature and penile length but only in small , underpowered , nonr and omised studies .
Studies of onabotulinum toxin A injections or thiocolchicine showed significant improvements in penile curvature , but only in studies of single-arm or case-control design .
CONCLUSIONS CCH and IFNα-2b injected into stable PD plaques can decrease penile curvature ; CCH can also improve penile length .
However , based on available data , strong conclusions can not be drawn for other treatments , including calcium channel blockers , HA , or mechanical therapies .
PATIENT SUMMARY Our systematic review of injection therapies provides evidence for improvements in penile curvature for patients with Peyronie 's disease .
No robust evidence is available to support the use of other local treatments including calcium channel blockers , hyaluronic acid , or mechanical therapies","In this paper, the authors describe a new approach to treating Peyroni's disease. They use a double blinded placebo-controlled trial of 80 patients with peyronie's condition who received either local squaline or verapamemil. The results showed that there was significant reduction in size and severity of the disease before and after treatments. There was also improvement in pain on eryection and penile curlvature. Although some studies have found no improvement in comparison to the control group, larger scale study are warrantedas to assess how this drug affects the treatment of such diseases.

There was a paucity of research looking at interventions targeting school readiness .
However , school-based behavioural interventions appear to improve cognitive , language and daily living skills , but have less impact on socialisation and peer inclusion .
CONCLUSION Children with ASD face more challenges transitioning to school , particularly with social interaction .","In this study, we examine the social relationships of children with and without an idgy or a diagnosis of autism in early childhood. We find that children with Aspect are less frequently accepted by peers than their peers across all grade grades. Children with ASD seem to be more likely to have isolated or peripheral social relationships within their classrooms than other children in the same sample.

In this group, they receive 4 IU per day; in other groups, they get 6 IU and 8 iu/m2 days. The results show that women with a Type I or Type II disorder can grow more rapidly than those without a condition. After seven years, height is increased by an even greater increase in foot. A comparison of body proportions between healthy Dutch girls and patients with Turner Syndrome shows that there is a significant difference in the size of the trunk, feet, and Biac during the first three years of treatment. For example, taller girls have larger trunks and smaller feet than older girls. This suggests that large feet might be a contributing factor to the natural development of children with TS. Six months later, a study is presented on the effect of growth-hormoning therapy on final height, sexual development, and psychological status for girls with Turner's syndrome. Girls received either recombineant human growth Hortense or ox plus rolone at the same time as control subjects. Both regimens resulted in improved height velocity over the previous two years. However, both regimens did not lead to any changes in bone age or adult height.

Two studies were performed after knee injury after ACL reconstructive surgery. One study examined the relationship between reinjury and return to sport before returning to full duty work. After two years, all patients returned to their normal levels of strength and function except for those with severe leg injuries. Recurrent symptoms were defined as either medical visits or self-report lost time. These measures were then used to predict whether workers would be able to return to their previous level of health.

No patient withdraws from the study because side effects occur. Antihypertensesive agents are used more frequently than one agent can control blood pressure since they require multiple agents to achieve adequate blood pressure control. One purpose of this multifactorial trial is to assess the long- term efficacy by comparing the direct RENIN inhibitor ALIskiren against the diuretics. Diuretics reduce blood pressure without creating clinically important sideeffects. Both drugs produce reduced blood pressure during the entire 24h interval.

A case control study compares outcomes and complications during two shoulder arthrocoplasty procedures: 1) TSA for severe glen-humeral joints; 2) rotator knee cuff tears. Both procedures have similar complications but require more time for recovery than either procedure. This study also uses side-byside cohorts to assess the relative risks of different types of body mass at different stages of injury. For example, one study suggests that greater body mass may be associated with longer postoperative times.

This study uses a female monkey model to investigate the effect of low energy supply on both the growth and recovery of reproductive function. The results suggest that women with irregular menstruals may be at greater risk for heart disease and stroke than those with normal menstruations.",0.11667543308151052
23160338,SUMMARY The use of statins was significantly associated with a decreased risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with sinus rhythm .,"In a double blinded, placebo-control trial, patients with acute atrial fillation were randomed to receive either 80mg of statin or placebo before the surgery. The results showed no significant change in the time for recurrance of AF; however, there was no difference in the severity of the disease. A study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of high- dose atorvastain on the risk of atrial Fiillation after coronaryartery bypass  Grafting. It was found that treatment with this anti-inflammatory drug did not prevent the development of atrium fibrillation. However, studies suggest that it may be beneficial to use statins as an anti-irritative agent.",0.7458886570631574

Our results suggest that weight loss may be an effective nonpharmacologic strategy for lowering CRP level","In this study, the effects of weight loss are compared on blood pressure, body weight, and endotometrial function. The results indicate that weight loss is associated with improvements in several markers of cardiovascular disease. A high-fat, low-carbidohydrate diet leads to significant reductions among cholesterol-reducing individuals. This study also examines the effect of physical activity on body weight and fat mass. It is shown that both diets lead to significant changes in body size and fat Mass. Both diets reduce levels of Creactive Protein, but neither does exercise.

This study also compares three root filling materials: mineral trioxidize aggregate MTA, IRM, amalgam, Super-eba, Epiphany Resilon, and ProRootMTA. Although these two materials have similar margins, they are not significantly different in terms of their ability to heal. A meta-analysis has been performed on teeth treated after 5 years with both surgical methods. The overall healing rate for tooth wounds is 84.5 percent with a difference of 20.1 p.1.0003 when comparing Medtronic TXA, 92.5 pg., and Com. However, the results from this prospective trial indicate that Medtronica TXAC exhibits a greater healing rate than Com in the long-prognosisof root-end sealerry.

They plan to enroll 450 patients who have recently had an infected myocardium and hypertension with a risk factor reduction of at least 20 percent over three years. The results show that the intervention group has a significant reduction in total mortality, sudden death, and non-fatal heart disease. This is due to the fact that they are more physically active during their follow-up than usual care. Two other studies describe the use of evidence-based physician reminders to improve patient behavior. One examines the impact of nurse-led self-care on patients with coronarry heart disease; the other uses a bargraph-based presentation of risk.

The results do not support the use of calcium supplementation  in healthy children as a public health intervention .
These results can not be extrapolated to children with medical conditions affecting bone metabolism","This study focuses on the relationship between cumulative teenage sports history and time-advised daily calcium intake to bone mineral gain. The results indicate that girls with preocious pu Bertry are more likely to have an increased bone mineral content than those who do not exercise frequently. In addition, there is no association between age 12 and 18 for total body bone Mineral Density at Age 18 years. Athletic scores in this group are not related to hip bone mineral densiputation; however, they are associated with increases in peak bone mineral mass. Thus, it is suggested that young girls with early puberty may be better protected from fractures because of their higher levels of physical activity. Carbonated beverages increase fracture risk but the mechanism remains unclear. A case control study investigates the association between milk consumption, physical activity, bone mineral concentration, and upper arm fracture risks in children aged 10-16 years. There is no significant effect altering habitual Calcium intake on the relations between calcium supplementations and height, weight, BMC, size- adjusted BMC or alkalines phosphatases.

He suggests that it might be possible to improve practice in terms of reduced use of IV drugs or combined use of antimicrobials. The study also shows that maternal health services continue favoring the wealthierest in lower income countries. PBF is an instrument for increasing health service use which is universally low. Maternal care services continue to favor the wealthyest among lower and middle- income countries; however, there is no evidence that such measures will do much to alleviate differences between wealth quinchtiles. This study examines the effects of performance-bearing financing on maternal health service uses when no specific provision target the poor most. It finds that women who receive support from community health workers are more likely to receive treatment from skilled practitioners than those who receive only indirect advice.

After ten weeks, patients received evidence-based feedback on their management of suspected respiratory tract infection. They found no difference in either disease severity or frequency of treatment seen by trained physicians. However, they did find improvement in patient satisfaction after one month's follow-up. These studies suggest that multi-topic medical training has an effective short run strategy to improve primary care in India. Although many informal health care providers lack formal medical training, some argue that training them may help improve quality of medicine at the same time as improving access to doctors.

A further study is needed to identify the relationship between excessive weight perception and changes in health. This study uses a cross sectional sample of Greek youth aged 13-18 years who report their eating attitudes.

Sixteen men with a unilateral rotating platform consent to participate in an institution-approved trial. Eight patients receive a single plane shape match and eight receive ligament  balancement using fixed thick spacer blocks. There are no significant differences between groups during kneeling activities. A spreader group shows more similar knee kinsematics than the normal knee when compared to the conventional knee during ascending motion. This suggests that it may be possible to improve knee function by more closely mimicking normal knee movements. The aim is to determine whether the prevalence of unwanted contact kinels during weight bearing kneeling are small and not different from groups of consecutive surgeons treated by other surgeons. Three surgeons are asked to perform Cemented Ligament Aligned Tka with patient- specific guides in ten consecutive patients with their desired cruciate retainer implant.

These relationships emerge in different type of surgical procedures and patients ' features .","The purpose of the present study is to assess the value of a new gait speed test, which predicts mortality in elderly patients who are scheduled for cardiac surgery. In this paper, we describe the results of an eight-year-old patient cohort that has been assembled at four tertyary care hospitals from 2008 to 2009. The primary endpoint was a Composite of in-Hospital Post-Operative Mortality or major Morbidity. A subset of elderly patients at greater risk of death or major morbity after cardial surgery were identified by slow gait speeds. This improved risk assessment could be used to better predict future complications and length of hospital stay. Fraildy scores may improve risk assessment in older patients but have not yet been studied in surgical patients. We develop a seven-point frailtiness score as a means of predicting long-term events; it is highly correlated with the Hopkins Fatigue Score.

The results are similar to those seen in mixed-dysiamic studies. For example, the effect of POM3 on lipoparticle size does not seem to be related to any reduction in totalcholesterol or other risk factors. However, there is some evidence that POM-3 will lower LDL cholesterol in isolated hypercholestemia. A further study is performed using a novel form of NMR specroscopy to determine changes in lipopropyl particle size and size. It was found that gemfibrozilyl treatment reduced both large and small lipoprograms but did not lead to new cardiovascular events. This study also suggests that Ipe may be an effective therapy for patients who have combined hyperlipoemia or isolated hypotriglycemia. Physicians were divided into three groups: 1) Atorvastain; 2) Niacin; and 3) Mipomersen. These subjects received either statin or placebo over a period of 26 weeks.

The results of the two studies suggest that Fb will lead to faster weight gain in treatment and less time in the hospital. A second study examines whether habit strength can be used as a predictor of BMI during weight restoration. In this first study, we examined the predictor factors for BMI: age, BMI, duration of disease, subtype or other axisI diagnoses, quality of Life, self-Esther, and psychological features relevant to anorezia nervousosus.

Costs are calculated individually and combined by calculating the number of people who suffer from neck pain in a two-year period. Neck pain is most frequently caused by complex relationships among individual and workplace risks factors. Neck injuries are more common in women than in men because of age, past musculonoskeletal pain, high quantitative jobs dem and sedenty work position, poor physical capacity, poor workstation designand work posture, sedenteary work position as well as repetitive work and Precision work. Neck problems are particularly important to workers because they involve complex relationships between individuals and work risk factors. A single-blinded treatment study was designed to determine the long-term consequences of an accident's neck injury. The patients were treated with either a light or heavy multidisciplinary treatment during the first fourteen days after the injury. There was no significant reduction in neck pain at that time but there was a better outcome for those who continued engaging in their usual pre-injury activity as usual. This study investigates prognosic factors for improving symptoms in employees with neck pain. Myofeed back training seems to be anespecially beneficial tool for second prevention among employees With moderate levels of illness, and symptom related disability, who respondto work-related stresses by increased/ustained muscleactivation, and who tendency to employ passivecoping to dealwith their neck/ shoulder symptoms. Return to work is also included as an outcomes variable. Two studies have been published on the effects of call center work with computers: one focuses on using a wide support surface and another on trackballs; these studies investigated the effect of armboards on neck pain severity and incidents of muscuoskeletal disorders. Both groups showed improvement in both pain intensity and fatigue. However, neither group had any significant differences in return to work. These studies are expected in 2007. Neck pain remains costly due to the fact that it is often the surgery of choice for herniated lumbar fractures. An exercise program has been developed to improve function and quality of life in office workers. It is proposed that such a program will reduce neck pain when used together with a workstyle intervention. Workers suffering from neck complaints are divided into three groups: work style group, work style plus physical activity group, or control group.

This study compares two different regimens of 10 and 20mg escorted by male mice fed a fat-supplemented diet. Both regimens reduced Lp; however, they did not show any significant changes in lesion size or blood lipid levels. Furthermore, there were only significant differences in lesions areas and serum values of cholesterol, MCP1 and tumor necroseis factor. These results suggest that ezetamibe can be used alongside statin treatments to improve LpL.Study 2: Many patients fail to achieve their recommended lipid goals due to inadequate dosses and increased risk for side effects. To further assess this point, we performed a doubleblind, crossover study in 628 patients who received statins but failed to achieve prescribed LDLC goals.

A highly significant difference in the survival rate between these three types of restorations is found among the success rates of various material restorations. For example, there is a significantly higher survival rate for preformed cements than for amalgams. Two alternative methods to restore primary teeth that have multiple surface lesions are examined in this study. In paired comparisons, stainless steel Crowns prove far superior to single surface amalgam restorations without regard to both lifetime and replacement rate. This study compared the retenttive strength of conventional glass iconomer concrete, a polycarboxeylate cement, and a PanaviaF resin cement.

Slow gait speed and low physical activity/exercise seem to be the most powerful predictors followed by weight loss , lower extremity function , balance , muscle strength , and other indicators .
Nevertheless , our study suggests that monitoring physical frailty indicators in community-dwelling elderly people might be useful to identify elderly people who could benefit from disability prevention programs","In this study, we examine the relationship between muscle strength and the risk of adversity among older Mexican-American men and women. We find that there is a linear association between weight loss and ADL disability for those who are in the lowest ""h"" or ""grip strength"" group when compared to those in the highest ""h."" The results suggest that muscular strength is an important predictor of future ADL decline. This study furthermore suggests that slow gait speeds, low physical activities, and weight Loss are significant risk factors for chronic disability. Furthermore, these risk factors are associated with long-term health stays, injurous falls, and death. These results support the useof slow gaits speed as key signs of frailties while concerns about self-repressed exhaustion have been raised.",0.06286549038939918

It includes recommendations for prophylacis for all types of surgical procedures, including abscesses, vaginally hysternectomy, and elective abdominal surgery. Two consecutive open-study studies are performed to determine whether antibiotic prophylactics with metirondazole after pelvic arm prolapse and or urinary incotinence surgery reduces urinary infection compared against placebo in rand and ommized doubleblindd trials. No significant difference in other parameters was found between groups; all P>05. Antibiotic Prophylaxes decreases positive urine cultures than placebo; symptomatic Urinary Trest infection at the six to eight weeks postoperative visit; and no significant differences were found in other characteristics such as  Pyexia and Duration of Post-Opportune Hospitalization.

After three weeks, the median concentration of thyroclobulin had changed all over the group except for the control group. This suggests that iomeded oil might be more effective than other methods for preventing ill health. Children with iron deficient anemia are susceptible to iron deficitiency and therefore should be given utmost attention to their performance on tests such as weight gain, intelligence, and motor function.

The mean hospital for special surgery knee score improved significantly from 55 points before operation to 92 point at the final follow up. Thirteen patient's thirteen knees died after lessthan ten years; thirty-een patients had a minimum ten year follow-up. At the end of follow-upper, no part was loose or loosening, and there were no signs of osteolysis. A survival rate of 100 % was achieved over tenyears. This study is followed by another case series: Level IV Study 1, which describes the peak outcomes of the Oxford University knee replacement procedure through a limited access incision. These results are not as good as those of other cases. Two studies report on the use of tension guided prostheses instead of spacer-guidled devices. They compare the stability of the tension-gudered device to that of a spacering-guided device. Both groups have better pain scores than those without any contraindications. There are three early versions of the British Oxford knee replacement, all of them performed between May 2000 and May 2003. All of these patients have potential contraindicaments, but none of them are ideal. The outcome of patients who have at least one possible contraindication is similar to or superior to those without it. Short-term survival improves when comparing the English knee score, the American knee society score, and the Tegster activity score. After several trials using different types of prosthesis, the Oxford group has an acceptable reoperation rate.",0.011032796755309725
19581635,"Contribution This systematic review found that radiofrequency ablation after a failed drug course maintained sinus rhythm more often than continuation of drug therapy alone .
The benefits of maintaining sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic drugs appeared to be offset by the serious adverse effects of the drugs .","In this study, we compare the ablation methods of an open irrigation needle with those of st or ard catheter for atrial vein isolation. We find that the use of higher power and shorter fluoroscopie time is associated with increased complications in patients who have been treated with warfarin before and after their ablation. The results of these studies suggest that warfarnion should be stopped three days prior to any ablation procedure because it can lead to significant complications. This approach also reduces instrumentation time by increasing the risk of cardiovascular complications. Although there is no reduction in fluorocoscopic time with the increase in power, conduction time increases as well. A patient's blood pressure changes from normal to abnormal when warfaran is stopped 3 days early. Heparin is used only once during ablation; however, Warfarin continues to maintain the International Normalized Ratison between 2 and 5 times per day. Ablation without warfarine remains effective throughout the treatment of acute fibrillation. Two different approaches are described: 1) combined linear mittal isthmus-ablation and pulmonary vein isolated in patients with Paroxysmal Atrial Fillation; and 2) single-arm circumferential lung vein isolation using electrodes instead of conventionally guided ablation techniques. These ablation strategies result in improved long-term control of atrial fillation.",0.005128703182773136

Thirty teeth are divided into three different groups: Carbon Fiber Reinforced Posts; Titan Prefabricated Post/Comosite Resin Core; and Fpc, quartz fiber reinforcement post/Compossite resin core. The results suggest that crowns based on either material or composite resin do not perform well when bonded directly to severely compromised teeth. This study investigates the fracture resistance of tooth restored with either cement-post or cast-post systems in teeth treated with different types of hard tissue losses. Aethetic Plus, DT, and Frc Postec were used as controls for root filled teeth. Over a mean period of four years, all restorations were successfully performed.

Our model provides an estimate of the daily vitamin D dose that is necessary for achieving adequate circulating 25OHD levels in vitamin D-insufficient or vitamin D-deficient individuals/cohorts with different body weights and ages","In this study, we assess the efficacy and safety of a daily dose of high-daily 125 ng. /day or 250 nmol. g. for rapidly obtaining sufficient 25 hydroxyvindal concentrations. After three months, all subjects had 25 hystericalvitamin D values above 85 moleculopard levels in 75 p.m. treated postmenopalusal women. The results suggest that the daily dose required to rapidly attain adequate levels is much higher than usual recommended doses. Aiming to establish the relation between steadystate cholecaliferol consumption and the resultant serum 25 OHD concentration, we examine the relationship between steady state blood concentration and the effect of vitamin D on the risk of major cardiac andcerebrovascular events. We conclude that patients with depleted 25Hhc levels are more likely to develop critical postoperative complications. Further research will clarify the potential benefit of vitamin E supplements in preventing falls and fracture among elderly nursing home dwellers. Adequate Vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk from falls and breaks. This study further investigates the effects of long-term daily doses of 1,500 iu..

Conclusions : Four clinical features ( prior stroke/TIA , advancing age , hypertension , diabetes ) are consistent independent risk factors for stroke in atrial fibrillation patients .","Stroke in patients with acute atrial fibrilation is associated with embolism caused by a reduction in the flow velocity of the left appendage, which leads to stasis and embolicities. The association between reduced flow velocity and increased risk of stroke also supports the notion that reduced flow speed may be involved in the formation of blood clots or embolities. In this study, we examine the relative risk of first stroke among Danish men and women who are younger than 35 years without previous stroke. Age, sexe, household income, smoking habits, hypertension, and alcohol consumption are independently associated with elevated risk for stroke. A two-year intervention study comparing aspirin with warfari in patients suffering from acute stroke was performed. This trial showed that aspirine was superior to warfarn in preventing recurrent heart attack but not in reducing major bleeding. Although warfarin has no significant effect on these outcomes, it is recommended that older patients receive prophylent antithrombotics to prevent stroke. Anticoagulating therapy remains underutilized in older patients who are at high risk of second stroke after adjusting their baseline risk factors. However, studies have shown that aspidin is more effective in treating stroke in older people with atrial fibrillation.

Forty percent of patients were anaemia during pregnancy, but only those receiving active treatment received iron or florc acid. Anemia was seen in 29 % of all patients who received antimalariums except for three patients who had malaria after failure to take care of treatment. Antimalarics are not effective in treating malaria because they do not have any significant effect on haematogen concentration. A regime has been proposed for thepreventing of malaria, iron deficientiency, folate deficiencies and anemia in pregnancy in the Guinea Savanna of Negro country. Pregnancy can lead to negative outcomes for the baby's health. Iron andfolic acid should be taken early in pregnancy as it reduces the risk of anemia. However, there is little evidence that these regimens work. Two studies examine the effects of weekly iron and mineral supplements on maternal hemogloin concentrations before and after delivery. One study compares the effect of daily instead of weekly supplementation on mothers' iron status. The results indicate that both regimens produce improved haemologlobin values at the endof gestation. Both regimens also improve blood ferritin content. Women receive iron from week 20 until birth. There is no difference in side effects between the two regimens.",0.6195165810014068

These signals consist of either 1) change in significance or relative increase in effect magnitude; 2) changes in uncertainty or direction of action; and 3) major changes in efficacy. In addition, we use fixed-effect methods to identify potential changes in results that would warrant update. Qualiitative signals include ""new information about harmsufficient to affect clinical decisions making"" and ""important caveats,"" as well as important changes in confidence or directions of effect. Major changes include differing characteristics of effectiveness less extreme than what could be beneficial but that would nonetheless affect medical decision making.",0.30810835767537664

Concustion knowledge at two months does not differ between the two groups; however, specific bodychecking related penalties are significantly reduced in an experimental group. A previous study showed that there was a higher risk of concurssion among Bantami ice hockey league players than among those who have no bodycheck experience in Peego Wee.

Half of these players wore full headgear, and half wear half shields for every practice/game throughout the season. Results show that players who wear half faces miss more practice time than players who wearing full face guards. Furthermore, players who use protective headgear lose more playing time when they wear them than they do when they don't wear them. These studies suggest that ""padded headges"" may reduce concusession in rugby uniforms at a younger age.

One study uses a double blinded trial to assess the effects of daily iron supplementation and another uses omicide-based regimens to test the effect of exercise on iron status. The results suggest that iron depleted women have better endurance after moderate exercise than those without anemia, but there is no clear evidence that this effect is due to overt tissue or disease. Red meat consumption has been reported to be associated with increased risks of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes; however, it remains unknown whether these association are related to un processed leanred meat. In this paper, we examine the relation among iron status and brain function in young women. We investigate the relationship between iron stores and fatigue during dynamic knee extension exercise in young females. After treatment, serum Ferritin increases significantly in all three groups receiving iron. Serum Transferrin Receptor concentrations increase significantly in the group receiving ferrous Sulfate as well as electrolytic iron, or hydrogen reduced iron. Women who consume red meat do not lose their iron status because they receive food from other sources. This suggests that iron supplements may not cause atherosynthesis by increasing free Radical Formation and oxidizing stress. However, some diets fail to alter blood levels. Consuming iron-rich rice does not affect haemogen concentrations nor changes in body ironstores. Hepicin concentrations are not affected by military training but are positively associated with ferritin, C-react Protein concentrations. Fe-defectiency anamemia is regarded as a worldwide problem.

Real-world ' implementation of lifestyle interventions for diabetes prevention may be expected to lead to modest outcomes","The Diabetes Prevention program, a lifestyle intervention for low- and middle-class Hispanics, has been shown to reduce the risk of developing type 2 by reducing body weight and improving metabolic measures in this group. In addition, it has been reported that weight loss can also prevent Type 2 development in people with premiabetes. This study compares the effects of a 14-week lifestyle intervention with a standard care regimen in patients with high-risk blood sugar levels. After comparing the results of the two treatment groups, we conclude that the combination of an intense lifestyle intervention and a daily metformin regimen resulted in a significant reduction in the severity of Type 2 disease among these patients.",0.9956905971922001

In conclusion , bariatric surgery predicts long-term decreases in CV risk in obese patients","In this study, we report the results of a series of 100 consecutive obese patients who undergone laparoscopic Gastric bypass for morbid weight loss. The mean age was 31 years and there were 63 women and 37 men. Preoperative body weight was 501 g/m2 and 33 patients were super-obedse. There was considerable improvement in severalco-morbid diseases such as hypertension and Type II diabetes. This study is a prospective, single-centre study designed to examine the relationship between blood pressure, total cholesterol, and high-denity lipoproprotein with coronary disease risk. A simple prediction equation was developed to predict Chad risk according to aged, diabetes, smoking, JNCV blood pressure categorical factors, and Nationalcholsterol Education Program total cholesterol and low-densitrated lipoprotein categories. After adjusted for other factors, approximately 28 percent of Chad events in men or 29 p.i.d. were associated with blood pressure levels exceeding high normal. Conclusions That recommended guidelines of bloodpressure, totalcholesterol, andLDL cholesterol effectively predicted CHD riskin a middleaged white population samples. A definitive model that predicts absolute risk of Coronary heart disease in people with type II diabetes is now available. An external validated study within the Prince's Epidemiology Study of Myofa rck ion describes the accuracy of Framingham Risk Score for coronary chest disease in British men free from acute cardiovascular disease at an early age. It also compares the relative risks among these risk functions with those calculated by the Frambringham risk function. These risk functions are accurate for European populations but overestimate the absolute risk assigned to each individual. Specific populationrisk functions are needed",0.9789570671883825

In this study, a group of 328 patients with Type 2 diabetes were assigned to receive real-time blood glucose results from a remote medical center and then followed up at their own home. After six months, the group showed significant reductions in Hba1c levels, LDL, cholesterol, knowledge, practice, and self-eficacy. This study concludes that ""telehomemonitoring"" is an effective method for controlling Type 2 disease. The first two studies are focused on African Americans with Type 2, who have poorly controlled Type 2 diseases. They report that they receive regular care or attend a nurse's telephone intervention. However, these patients do not show improvement in their blood pressure, glycerin levels, or quality of life. Further studies are needed to identify how best to reduce risk factors among African Americans without improving health status.",0.7826042174861425

We find that about 40 p.m. children regularly watch both regular and over-the-top forms of entertainment, with parents watching more than half their time. This suggests that parents should be encouraged to encourage their children's habit of watching with their children. A pilot study was designed to measure the relevance of search results by using three different approaches for the Pubmed search system. The results were compared among thirty-one subjects given three different questions. Each question had a high precision score, which reflected the relative importance of the relevant article found in the result set.

The absolute risk reduction in mortality from surgery ranges from 4.5 to 17.2 percent for low-risk patients and about a half of men have an individualized advantage within even 50% of the means. Astrazeneca's Grant is now under discussion. Prostate-cancer survival rates are reported in several studies. One of the most recent trials uses PSA as a predictor of disease-free outcome. After a mean follow-up interval of 11 years, there was no significant difference in all cause mortality between arms. Men who had PSA levels greater than 4.0 were more likely to die from prostate cancer than those with PSA values less than 5.0. This suggests that early salvage therapy may be superior to immediate post-operative treatment.

They conclude that it is associated with improved patient outcome and quality of life. The results are encouraging and further support to be added to the use of telemontoring as an intervention in patients with severe obstrutive pulmonary disease. A pilot study has been conducted for patients with mild to severe syphilis who have not yet had a serious episode of exaggeration.

A core set of outcomes is proposed by theAmerican College of Rhematology and the OmeractStudy 1, which includes ""observational and long-term observational studies"" such as wrist and fingers surgery. These studies provide important information about the progress of disease and its treatment. For example, there have been no consensus on whether the modified Kap or ji scale should be used for measuring strength. This study determines the reliability, validity, andresponsiveness of the Modified Kap and Ji Index. Forty two patients were included in these studies. Thirteen patients were very satisfied/displeased with their results; seven were not satisfied nor dissatisfactioned. An instrument for assessment of tenderness was developed. It uses a combination of joint scores from three joints: the Arthoris Impact Measurements Scales, the Functional Status Index, and the Health Assessment Questionnaire.

Another study was carried out on elderly Thai women aged 70 or more who had hypovitaminics. Both groups received either alfacalcol or calcium but no significant change in muscle strength was observed. These studies suggest that cavialcidol may have an effect on backextensor muscles because it reduces the risk of fractures.

A prospective study compares sulmactam andampicillin as prophylactics against post-operative wound infection. This trial shows that an early initiation of therapy can reduce the risk of complications. Two different regimens are used to treat children with acutely ill appendicitis. One uses gentamaticin, ampicillin, and cefiaxone, while the other uses clindainsanate. Children with complicated appenicitis often experience delays in their surgery due to inability of parents and medical practitioners to identify the disease early. These delays are associated with long delayed surgical times. Although many surgeons continue using multiple agents, it is not always possible to use them as adjunctive treatment. Some surgeons still use multiple agents because of the potential for adverse drug reactions. However, these general surgeons do not hesitate to use multiple antimbiotics when there is little chance of resistance.",0.025484785253849448
17054183,AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS Feeding with a soy formula can not be recommended for prevention of allergy or food intolerance in infants at high risk of allergy or food intolerance .,"In this study, the effect of feeding infants with cow's milk proteolytic disease on their pancreatic function is examined. The patients are divided into two groups: 1) infants who have no gastrointestinal diseases and 2) infants that receive a free feed. Both groups show significant increases in trypsesin concentrations after six weeks of diet. A positive correlation between age-matched enzyme concentrations and basal values was observed. Immune response to influenza type b, diphteria, and  Poliovirus were found within normal range; however, only physician reported diarrhea was seen among soy-flour fed infants. This study concludes that infants treated with soy formula for at least four months reduce the risk of developing asthma by 6 years. It is further established that exclusive breastfed infants may be associated with reduced risks of asthma and other childhood illnesses. Thus, public health intervention to promote an increase in length of exclusive breasting may help to prevent prematurely atopical disease from becoming a major problem in Australia.",0.9778992385999818

Both groups showed improved blood glucose tolerance and reduced risk of increased glucose concentration in the intervention arms as well as lower values for fasting blood sugar. The effect was not significant, however, for maternal weight gain; it did not significantly affect gestational weigh gain. In contrast, the low-glicaemic loading diet had a beneficial effect on both pregnancy and birth weight. This study compares the effects of an individualized General dietary intervention with an intense low-grimemic load regimen on blood lipid management and pregnancy outcome in women with Gessia Mellitus.

The results indicate that lower levels of fat and high-quality protein are more effective in reducing blood pressure and cholesterol than they are in preventing heart disease. We conclude that reduced-calorie foods can be beneficial for weight loss because they increase both body weight and blood pressure. This paper also discusses the use of low-fat, low-carbidohydrate, and reduced-carbody diets as weight loss approaches.

The effect is similar to that of both drugs but only the alpha-ketane blocker has significant effects on maternal blood flow. A double blind study compares efficacy with safety of antihyptertensive medication by 77 pregnant women and their 82 newborns. Pregnancies in which hypertension is severe or life-threatening are treated with either drug. Both groups have significantly different birth weights and lengths of gestation.

The goal of the intervention is to help them return to their pre-pregnancy weight, if they are normal or lose some weight after pregnancy. Women in this condition are more likely to reach their postpartum goals than usual care. In addition, the intervention reduces dietary fat and increases breast milk. Although no differences in physical activity were seen between conditions, the results suggest that a life intervention that starts before pregnancy and continues after pregnancy may prevent pregnancy loss and help overweight woman lose weight.",0.9805307373748137

Conclusions Our review highlights the significant time spent in sedentary behaviour during pregnancy , and that sedentary behaviour may impact on pregnancy outcomes for both mother and child .","Pregnants without BMI and overweight and obese women at risk of pregnancyal diabetes are compared in this study. They found no association between daily physical activities and birth weight, but there were no significant differences in time spent on either activity. Women who met prenatal physical activity recommendations had less time spent in sleep, sedential behavior, or light activity than those who didn't meet the recommended levels. This study is part of a larger trial to determine whether a combination of exercise and a diet can reduce gestational complications in overweight and obesity pregnant women. In this study, we examine the effect of lifestyle advice on maternal health outcomes during pregnancy.

Nevertheless , overall and particularly in trials not funded by the pharmaceutical industry , exogenous testosterone increased the risk of cardiovascular-related events , with corresponding implication s for the use of testosterone therapy","The first study focuses on the use of an anti-prostatic drug, enzalutemide, to prolong survival in men who have castration-restrained prostate cancer after treatment. In this trial, patients receive a single dose of 160mg per day or placebo and their overall survival is 18.4 months. This results in a significant prolongation of survival for men with castrated-resistant prostate disease. A second study involving older men with reduced free testosterone levels shows that they are at increased risk of death from cardiovascular events than those who do not experience these events. Men with elevated free testosterone also have a greater risk of mortality than those with low free testosterone levels. These studies suggest that transdermal therapy may be beneficial in treating older men without hypogonadicity. Another study examining the effects of long term glucotonicoid regimens on bone mineral densities in men with high bioavailable testosterone levels has been performed.

The results indicate that there is no significant difference between the three polishing methods when used with all other composites except for FX; however, they do show similar surface smoothness in some cases. Conclusions: While the sof-lex discs provide the least surface roughness, the enhancee polishing system providedthe most stain resistance after storage in cafe solution. In this study, the effect of acidic medicine on the surface degradation of six different resins was examined. Under pH-cyclizing conditions, the degradation of the four composites was studied.

Further studies were undertaken to assess the safety and effectiveness of red Clover extract on hot flushing in postmenophausal women. These studies included a doubleblind, parallel-, multi- center, rand Omized, double blind controlled trial of 16608 postmanopausals who had not been hystedected at baseline. All patients were assigned into two groups: 1) treated with 50 mg GENISTIN and DAIDZIN per day; 2) treated with 60 mg genIstein per day. Both groups reduced the severity of hotflues as soon as two weeks. Although both groups experienced less pain during the first four weeks, they did not experience any change in quality of life. Red Clover has no side effects. further studies were carried out to evaluate the benefits of soying protein isolate on cold flushes.

They conclude that ""best care"" is more effective for general practice than either of these two approaches. A further study is presented to assess the effects of an Arthritas Self-help course and the Chronic disease Self-Management program on persons with arthritis about health care use, health- related quality of life, health behavior, and arthritisself-efficace. The results are similar between the two groups at 4 months. This suggests that self-efficiecacy theory may be useful when people with multiple comoresbid conditions are treated. Back pain is primarily caused by knee pain. Previous studies suggest that self management techniques can be effective in improving arthritis self-confidence. However, there is little evidence that any form of exercise or therapy can improve patients' physical function. For example, one group of patients has improved their ability to walk better after six months of exercise. Another group has improved his ability to perform everyday activities. Finally, both groups have significant improvements in overall health.",0.9899182900687814

In the study that used an AAC intervention , there were significant gains in frequency of PECS use and verbal and non-verbal initiations , but not in expressive vocabulary or social communication immediately postintervention .
In the study that investigated a verbally based intervention , there were no significant gains in expressive language postintervention , but children with lower expressive language at the beginning of the study improved more than those with better expressive language at baseline .

The results are interpreted as supporting the theory that the use of ""picture symbols"" can teach coordinated attention to objects and person without eye contact. Children with an autistic background show significant improvements in joint-attention and joint-engagement from baseline to 12 months after the intervention. Parents in the parents-therapist group demonstrate greater use of these early intervention strategies at home while untrained adults do not.

Consumption of iron-fortified foods results in an improvement in hemoglobin , serum ferritin , and iron nutriture and a reduced risk of remaining anemic and iron deficient","In this paper, the effects of ionic iron on anemic student's body are examined. The effect is greater in the Nafeeta group than that of FeSO4 or Fe-reductiond iron; however, both groups have significant increases in blood concentration and iron stores. Both groups also show signs of improvement in their mineral status. Children with elevated iron status receive either fortified flour as food vehicles or non-fortable flour. This study investigates whether co-coating salt with Fe will improve iron status in children with high levels of anemia. A large intervention trial was planned to test the hypocrisy of infants receiving ""iron-Fortified Formula"" because it does not have higher incidence of infection or gastrointestinal disturbance than infants who receive cow's milk. Iron-Feolate formulas are frequently used but safety aspects have never been adequately studied. Iron could theoryly increase prooxidant stress, with potential detrimental effects, including infection risks, and some physicians suspect that iron -- fortification -- induces gastrointestinal perturbations. However, these studies do not reveal any adverse health effects among older infants or toddlers whose consumption of low iron-FORMulas has proved difficult at countries with Phytate-Rich diets. For example, a novel haemIron preparation was developed which improved iron status by increasing ferritin concentrates. Although there were no differences across treatments, they did not differ in the incidence of infections, constipation, or weight gain. After 10 weeks, the cumulative intake of legumes was approximately 80 percent of that offered signifying an addition approximately 1300 millig/L of either Haem or Iodized iron in the respective treatment groups. Hematological markers of iron status increased by the ordering of 7.3:1 g hb during the intervention, but no significant differences across trials. Furthermore, after 10 weeks Hb concentration changes significantly from the beans-only group to the haeme iron group. As such, leaf concentrate may be more effective in treating anemia in young girls.",0.9872808638557955

24445948,"Conclusions : This meta- analysis shows that regardless of the administration method , TRT is the short-term safety and does not promote prostate cancer development or progression but long-term data are warranted with justifiable end points","In this study, we examine the effects of combination therapy with avodart or tamsonosin on lower urinariy tract symptoms in hypogonal men with benign prostatichyponism. The results indicate that combination therapy is superior to either monotherapy because it reduces the risk of acute Ury retention and BPH related surgery. This study also provides evidence for the safety and efficacy of combined therapy in elderly men with moderately toevere lower urine tract symptoms due to benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. We further investigate the effect by using a double blinded placebo-control trial of older men who had low levels of serum testosterone. After three months of treatment, both groups showed significant increases in lean mass and body fat. Both groups improved bone mineral density but no significant changes occurred in PSA or prostate size. These studies have important implications for the preventive and treatment of Osteporosus in older men With low serum testosterone level. Men over 65 years old were assigned to receive transderl testosterone patches as part of a 36-month regimen. Bioavailability was not an included criterior critic. A group of 167 older men received transdermal testosterone patch after 12 months. Functional performance, strength, and bodycomposition were not different from those treated with placebo. They did not show any change in blood count or lipoprotein concentration. However, they increased bone mineral density in the neck and spine. As men age, their serum T levels decrease; however, there is little difference in bone mineral Density overall. Thus, increasing the serum Tretest concentrations of males over 60 years will increase their bonedensity. Furthermore, these men are more likely to be at risk of declining muscle function when they receive testosterone. For example, one study suggests that testosterone may help maintain normal brain function during aging. Two other studies suggest that testing can improve physical function in older patients with low testosterone content.",0.970209591224399

There was no evidence that methylpheni date has a negative impact on the core symptoms of ASD , or that it improves social interaction , stereotypical behaviours , or overall ASD .","In this chapter, the authors present two studies on children with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. First, they describe a double blinded, placebo-control study of 180 children with low intelligence who receive the same dose of methylphini date in three independent, placebo controlled studies. The results show that both teachers and parents are improving on their scores on various tasks. Second, they report that there is no significant difference in behavior between children with lower IQ and those with higher IQ. Third, they conclude that different attentional mechanisms might moderate response to these stimulants. Children with high IQ or mental retardation seem to respond better than children with other disorders. Finally, they suggest that it may be beneficial for children with less IQ but more varied levels of activity. These studies confirm and add further to the literature suggesting that ADHD children can benefit from treatment with hypnogeni date. A second study examines the effect of methylphi date on socialization and self-regulfment in children with coexisting neurodevelopmental problems. This study also reports that Methyri date improves social communication and control over children with pervaive developmental disorders.

It also discusses the use of Pros as an outcome in RCTs to improve reporting of patient reported outcomes. In this study, children aged 3 to 6 years will be assigned to either conventional restoration or composite resin treatment. They will be divided into two groups: experimental group and control group. The first group will consist of children who have at least one carious primary tooth; the second group is composed of dentists and children's carers. Children will be treated with both methods. Acute restorative therapy has been used for treating caries but it has not been shown to be particularly effective in treating patients with low caries prevalence. Another trial compares the efficacy of ""art"" and ""mith"" techniques in managing dentition lesions in young children. These studies include comparisons of pain perception and behavior among children treated with different approaches. Children were divided into four groups: conventional restorations, hall technique, a trauma restoratory treatment, and no caries removers. Children had more negative behavior in the Art group than those in the other groups. Shorter-term follow-up studies were required to examine changes in child health after treatment for Early Childhood Caries using two treatment strategies. One group was traumatic restorating treatments while the other was a combination of traditional Restorative Methods, Stand and Ard Care Approaches. Two hundred and 50-four children completed the Dental Anxiety Scale at baseline and followed up. At follow up, children showed less pain when they were treated with a Traumatic Restorive Method.

In Caucasian women , drinking milk also reduces fracture risk .","In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to predicting the risk of fracture from a diet based on a population-based study of Norwegian women and men. They report that there is an elevated risk for fracture in women who consume high amounts of dairy or animal sources because they have a negative balance of calcium. The results suggest that drinking more than three quarters of their daily caloric intake may lead to hip fracture. A further study suggests that consumption of higher levels of dairy and animal sources could reduce the risk by reducing the risk associated with stroke and cardiovascular disease. However, it is not yet clear whether these risks are due to the presence of certain risk factors. Furthermore, evidence suggests that taking large amounts of milk might increase the chance of developing a severe myocardical infarotism. Thus, the aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the association between consuming larger amounts of water and reduced risk of heart attack and stroke. This study was conducted in a Dutch elderly woman sampled at Tannerstage I-Ii. She consumed 60 g each of either reduced fat Goudas type cheese or vitamin D-3 enriched goat cheese for eight weeks. There were significant differences in serum 25-OHD levels among the two groups. The mean difference was 1 pmol/L. At follow-up, both groups had significantly greater bone mineral content.

This study also uses the Simple Score on FrailTy as an assessment tool for older women who are at risk of falling, fracture or death. Although there is no single accepted definition of ""frilty,"" several studies have attempted to develop tools to predict these events. One of the most important features of the score is its ability to predict future adverse health consequences. These include increased risk of fall, disability, hip fracture, and disease.

14583958,"REVIEW ER 'S CONCLUSIONS Quitting smoking is associated with a substantial reduction in risk of all-cause mortality among patients with CHD .
This 36 % risk reduction appears substantial compared with other secondary preventive therapies such as cholesterol lowering which have received greater attention in recent years .
The risk reduction associated with quitting smoking seems consistent regardless of differences between the studies in terms of index cardiac events , age , sex , country , and time period .","In this study, we examine the relationship between smoking and quality of life in patients who undergo thromboplastination. After two multi-centre clinical trials, we find that those who stop smoking within one month have a significantly reduced risk of death than those who persist for five years. We conclude that continuing to smoke can halt the risk of dying after an acutemyo Cardiol infa Rct Ion or sudden heart death. This is important because it reduces the odds of dying from new major events caused by myoatic heart disease. The British Regional Heart Sedgment was used to separate men into three different groups on the grounds of resting electrodes, chest pain questionnaires, and recall about a doctor's diagnosis with angina or previous heart attack. Men were divided into three groups: no evidence of mechaeic heart disease; group 1 had no evidence but only a short duration of follow up; and group 3 had a long term follow-up. These results indicate that smoking may not be just a ""risk factor,"" but also a casually independent predictor of future major events due to hisophytic heart disease as well as other risk factors. Prognosies during 5 years after first myofa r Ct ionic were related to riskfactors determined at the start of MI. Progression occurred when there was severe angina Pectoris, recur MyocardialInfa Rct Ion, and cardiac Death. Type A Score was the strongest single prediction of relapseChemical diseases are associated with additional risks such as increased blood pressure, serum totalcholesterol, and body Mass Index. Predictors of outcome include left ventricular functions, diabetes, and smoking.",0.7640283629930597

The results suggest that women experience greater reductions in their platelet reasonation after aspidin therapy than men. We also discuss the use of front loaded tissueplasminogen activateator and weight-ajusted Heparin to prevent strokes in patients who are at risk of severe bleeding. A recent observational study suggests that front-loaded asprin does not increase serious bleeding; however, it does not seem to have any deleterious side effects. Although many drugs implicated in cause these admissions include low-dose Aspirin, Diuretics, Warfarin, and Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs other than aspriin, the most commonly reaction being bowel bleeding. Furthermore, there is no difference in the odds of suffering a major or minor stroke among those receiving high-dose/Aspirin. There is no significant difference between the cumulative event free rate for the lower doses of either aspiriin or placebo. However, several studies have suggested that chewing asprain may be more effective in preventing blood clots than swallowing whole tablet.

The results suggest that concusions may lead to delayed recovery for long periods of time. This paper also describes the use of Apex as a predictor of postural stability. It was found that there were no significant relationships among changes in Apen values and changes within or after injury. Furthermore, it suggests that patients' self-re reported symptoms may result in under diagnosis of concoussion and might result in premature returns to play. Concuses occur annually in America and many professional football players suffer from concusacks. These players often have previous concustissions which increase the risk of having another concussession. ImPACT has been used to assess both mental and physical function in elite American sports players. Post-concurssion symptoms appear to be similar between injured and non-injure participants.

The first ablation strategy was superior to the second in maintaining sinus rhythm after procedures 1, 2, and 3; the second ablation scheme was superior because it had a longer follow-up period with no antiarrhythmical drugs. A long-term success rate without anarrhythmic medication was 39 p.m. with PVI as well as 75 % using PVIplus LL. This study is designed to determine whether the degree of endotothelial disease predicts the outcomes of AF Ablation and to examine whether ED could be improved through maintenance of SinusRhythm by successful Ca. It is shown that FMD, left atrium volume, and heart rate variability are independent predicters for arrhythmy recurrance after Ca. In addition, other biomarkers are not related to ritmia outcome.

In this paper, we examine the safety and effectiveness of Passiflaria incarnatus Linneaus as an antianxious and antidepressive agent in patients with severe anxiety disorder. We also investigate the efficaciousness of chamome extract in treating chronic insomnia. A double Blind Rand-Omized Crossover Trial was conducted in thirty-six patients aged 18 years old with DSMIV primary insomnia. Both groups showed modest improvement in sleep quality but no significant difference in daytime symptoms. Furthermore, there was not a significant change in state anxiety or mood scores between groups. Further studies will be needed to confirm our findings. Anxiety suffers from a substantial cost to the public health care system while conventional drugs have simplified treatment. Many patients seek alternative and/or complementary treatments for anxiety. To date, no study ever has examined the efficiacy of narnamic care on anxiety. However, many patients seek alternate approaches and can benefit from natural remedies.",0.699957576081266

The highest consistency of results showing atypical time perception abilities is found in high-level time perception studies .
It remains unclear if autism is characterized by a fundamental time perception impairment .
Overall , there are a number of studies that show differences between autistic and non-autistic individuals , but some studies do not find such differences .
Group differences are more consistent across studies using complex tasks rather than simpler more fundamental timing tasks .","In this study, we examine the impact of ""implementation intentions"" on prospect ve memory ability in adults with autistic spectrum disorder. Twenty- seven adults with an ASD were assigned to perform tasks that required them to form an intended action and then record their performance on a battery of tests. The results suggest that there is a selective decline in time- or event-based progressing memory in Autistic Spectrum Disorders. However, it is not clear whether these abilities are due to diminished visual or verbal storage capacities. We investigate the relation between working memory and task performance in ASD by comparing three experiments: 1) subjects receive a fixed duration of one or two seconds; 2) subjects receive multiple versions of the same task; and 3) subjects use different types of temporal generalizing stimuli. These studies provide important evidence for the importance of delayed actions in children with early childhood ASDs.",0.9205105810527916

However , the trend towards including fewer attributes was reversed , whilst the trend towards interview-based DCEs reversed because of increased computer administration .
The trend towards using more flexible econometric models , including mixed logit and latent class , has also continued .
Reporting of monetary values has fallen compared with earlier periods , but the proportion of studies estimating trade-offs between health outcomes and experience factors , or valuing outcomes in terms of utility scores , has increased , although use of odds ratios and probabilities has declined .
The reassuring trend towards the use of more flexible and appropriate DCE design s and econometric methods has been reinforced by the increased use of qualitative methods to inform DCE processes and results .
However , qualitative research methods are being used less often to inform attribute selection , which may make DCEs more susceptible to omitted variable bias if the decision framework is not known prior to the research project .","In this paper, the authors present a method for predicting the willingness-to pay for alternative approaches to prevent malaria in pregnancy. They use a choice-experiment approach to assess the influence of frequency of administration on parents and health care practitioners when comparing two different options: 1) an antimicrobial regimen; and 2) an antifungal regimen. Their results indicate that physicians have higher willingness to pay than their patients for both strategies. The study also suggests that surgeons may improve shared decisionmaking by undersisting that patients places high importance on ""quality of life symptoms."" This knowledge can be used as heuristic tools for prophylactacy programs. A survey of all orthopedic and nervous surgeons is conducted with a sample from the German population.

Preference values were determined using a conjoint analysis question elicitated by multiple subjects. Both types of treatment attributes were important to patients. Type of drug administration was the mostimportant attribute to patients but cost was significant predictor of choice. Patients with severe pain preferred either type of treatment or one of the other treatments. Physicians who had previous experience of surgery preferred imiquimod because they felt it would reduce their risk of complications.

In 1587 patients, we enrolled 1589 men and women aged 18 years or older with asymptomatic heart failing for at least three months. The primary outcomes were the time tofirst occurrence of dead, nonfatual myocardials infa-rct Ion, nor fatal strokes. For the first composite end point, the hazar ratio was as follows: warfarin against aspirin, 0.98; 9 p.1.. P =0.77. War farin was associated by fewer nonfatty strokes than either aspirine or clodipogrel respectively. Major bleeding occurs in 565 patients who start outpatient treatment withwarfarin upon admission from a University hospital. Five independentrisk factors for major blood -- age 65years or greater,"" history of stroke "", history of anemia, acute fistbite, or serious commorbid condition -- predicted majorbleed in the test group.

Speed of processing , set-shifting and cognitive impulsiveness were less frequently investigated but seem to be altered in the 7-repeat allele carriers .
High reaction time variability seems to be the most replicated cognitive marker associated with the 10-repeat homozygosity .","Predictions about development, interrellations, and possible independent working memory, inhibition, and cognitiveflexion are tested in three25 children from four to 13 years of age. The cost of manipulating memory is greater in younger children than in adults; however, when compared to adult levels, it is evident that the costs of manipulation are greater in young kids. In addition, there are differences between these effects over age. For example, maternal smoking has been shown to have an inverse relationship with child performance on the attention-defiant disorder, ADHD. A birth cohort set up within Menorca Island was set up as a study for infants. It was used to assess motor and cognitive abilities at age 4: Maternal smoke during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of behavior disorders in children; but some cohort studies measured smoking's specific effects on pre-schooler's brain function. Matrices were used to examine whether maternal smoking had an implication on child performance. This paper investigates whether or not dopamine transporteder gene, DAT1, plays a role in medication-related alteration in children with attention deficiency and hyperactivity disorder. Children with one copy of DAT1 showed better performance on sustained attention tasks and improved executive function scores.

The results show that air abbrasion has a higher rate of retention than either technique, but there is no difference in the amount of time it takes to remove caries after one, two, or five years. Bonding agents can be used as cussure sealers; however, this study does not compare the three types of bonding agents: Delton Plus, Delton Conicise, and Optibond solo.

All children were assigned different treatment groups for their pit/fussure sites. They were evenly distributed among four groups except for a single bonding agent, which had a greater reduction in the risk of caries development than did controls. In addition, fluoride was found to be more effective in controlling fissure lesions than other treatments.

16286432,"RA-related work-disability rates were similar in the USA and European countries .
An apparent decrease in the prevalence of RA-related work disability since the 1970s may be related to a decrease in physically dem and ing work rather than to epidemiologic changes in RA .
The majority of the literature addresses permanent disability and temporary work loss ; none of the studies review ed reported the effect of RA on presenteeism , i.e. work limitation from the employer perspective , and there are few published studies of the effectiveness of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in reducing work-related productivity loss","In the first three years after onset of disease, patients with early-stage rheuumatoisd arthritis experience a significant reduction in their costs. This is due to the absence of strenuous work conditions that are associated with an increase in cost. The most important factor for decreasing the risk of losing work is ""adjusting job dem"" and ""pacing."" Behavioral coping also plays a key role in this study. A patient's response to treatment increases the likelihood that his or her future earnings will be reduced. For example, patients who have high levels of education and low age are more likely to lose work than those who do not have high level of education. Workers who have lower levels of physical activity are less likely to suffer from work loss. Work disability is predicted by nearly every demographic and health-related variable. Although there has been no long-term studies on work disability among patients with late-stage diseases, this paper describes the work history as well as the risks of work loss within patients with relapsed RA. It uses a large number of clinical, laboratory, and observational measures to assess the extent of work disability during the course of illness.",0.9932354879730562

In high risk infants who are unable to be completely breast fed , there is evidence that prolonged feeding with a hydrolysed compared to a cow 's milk formula reduces infant and childhood allergy and infant CMA .","In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of early breast feeding on infants' pancreatic function. He compares two different milk-based diets to determine whether they reduce the time for the stomach to transit in preterm children. The first trial is a crossover design that involves twelve infants and 14 controls who receive either a cow's milk Protein allergy or a dairy-protein formula over the next six weeks. This study results in a reduction in the severity of allergic reactions at age 2 years from birth to 4 months. A group of 105 healthy term babies were assigned at birth with one of three feed regimens: human milk, cowmilk formula, or casein hydrogenlysate Formula. After 3 days of daily feeding, each infant was exclusively breastfed. At 18 months after birth, there was not a significant difference in the frequency of symptoms between the two treatment groups. However, both groups had significantly greater risk than the control group of mothers who did not have an asthmatic family history. Both groups also had lower levels of food allergy. Although these studies suggest that exclusive breast feeding will reduce the risk of developing asthma, Anderson concludes that it would be beneficial for public health to improve the quality of infant care by increasing the length of exclusive breastfeeding.",0.663432750870491

Current evidence demonstrates that lateral wedge insoles appear ineffective at attenuating structural changes in people with medial knee OA as a whole and may be better suited to targeted use in biomechanical phenotypes associated with larger reductions in knee load","In this study, we examine the effect of a custom fit knee brace with an extra-long foot orthotic on knee apologies in patients who have varus-aligned knees. The results suggest that using such a brace and shoe can reduce the external knee Adduction moment by increasing the frontal lever arm. This suggests that wearing a separate brace or shoe can increase the reduction in the internal knee ADduction moment through combined effects. Two other studies investigate whether laterally-wedged shoes can reduce knee pain in patients with early-stage knee osteoarthris. One study uses a modified heel wedge to determine whether gait changes after one month; the other uses barefoot walking. Both studies show no significant differences between groups in terms of patient compliance, body massindex, and severity of knee disease. Finally, we develop a validated method for assessing the efficacy of late-wielding insoles as an aid to improving knee function.",0.3452905043586855

The results suggest that there may be a direct effect on brain function from the use of these drugs. Although previous studies have suggested that drug use is related to memory impairments, it is not yet clear whether such changes are permanent or temporary. A study has been conducted to assess brain structure markers for evading drug use in frequent amphetine-type stimulants. It was found that subjects who used more than 5 unit lifetime dose of ambroxin showed reduced prefrontal cortical volumes as well as smaller fronto-sternal cortex volume. This suggests that an individual vulnerable to the transition between occasional amphetate-type stimulus use and regular ampheatamine use might be vulnerable to depressive moods after taking too many pills. However, no association between depression and frequency of consumption of other illicit chemicals is observed. To determine the relationship between escalting ecstatic use and depressing moods, we examine the incidence of epstasy abuse and dependence in a sample of young adults. There is no association with depressed mood among those who stopped using Ecstasies during their lifetime. Furthermore, patients with chronic Posttraumatic Stress disorder were treated with concomiant active drug but did not experience any serious adverse events.

A further study was conducted to investigate the effect of aspirine, ticlapidine, and their low-dose combination on the aggregibility of platelet aggregates. Both groups showed reduced bleeding during the 12 months following the initial treatment. These results do not support current recommendations that patients with Major GI intolerance should receive aspirinate. This study also examines the use of warfarin for patients with reduced heart failure. It is shown that warfarn is superior to either drug alone in inhibitring platelet function.

The results indicate that boys who become overweight are more likely to have internalizing behavior problems, social skills, approaches to learning, and absents from school than boys who remain normal weight. However, this link is mostly absent among girls because they tend to be less externalizing when they lose their weight. In addition, changes in body mass index are associated with reduced academic scores and teacher's evaluations of social-habitual outcomes. Boys who become overly overweight do not show any improvement in these outcomes. Furthermore, being always-overweighed is also associated with lower scores on tests of socialbehavior and approaches to learn among girls. Girls who begin school being overweight during the first four years may need to carefully monitor their progress.

Another suggests that sustained-release buspirone might be useful because it reduces the severity of symptoms. This paper also discusses the use of ""equipoise-strange"" design whereby patients are assigned to a number of specific options but then left to choose only one option. It describes three different approaches to treating depression: 1) short-term fluoxetine replacement; 2) switching to another agent; and 3) using consensus guidelines. These strategies work very well in both groups.",0.028387030041039693

CONCLUSION There is a trend that validation against a similar construct yields higher correlation coefficients than validation against a dissimilar construct .","In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of health status measures in a patient population of rhumatoisd arthritis. He compares the efficacy of gold, placebo, and aneroid strength measures to determine whether they are more sensitive to drug-induced changes in patients' health. The results suggest that either method is more effective than other methods for detecting changes in pain, physical disability, psychological status, and pain. This report furthermore provides evidence that the Arthrites Impact Measurements scale is superior to the conventional Beck Depression Inventory as a measure of quality of life.

The results suggest that all patients may benefit from this type of treatment. A study is presented to evaluate whether different types of biopsychosocial treatments are more effective for patients suffering from temporandiodyssey than usual medical treatment. Nineteen-four patients were assigned into either an early-treatment group, a Cognitive-behaavioral Skills training group, or 'no-treatment control groups'. All patients showed significant improvement in pain scores at three and twelve months after receiving treatment. These results provide further supports for cognitive - behavior models of chronic painful problems. This report also describes a trial designed to compare the effect of a short CB intervention delivered before usual treatment with the effects provided by a psychological/behavior approach. It was found that patients who had high somatization did not respond favorably to the brief Cb intervention. However, these patients reported greater long term decreases in reporting pain level and discomfort in daily activities as compared to those who received just usual treatment. Furthermore, both groups improved significantly on pain-related measures. Finally, they concluded that there was no difference in pain intensity or activity interference between the two groups during the follow-up period.",0.976473069608765

The obtained dose-response estimate between vitamin B-12 intake and status provides complementary evidence to underpin recommendations for a vitamin B-12 intake of population","The effects of a daily multivitamin on nutritional status, quantitative heel-ultrasound, muscle strength, and falls were studied in 92 elderly patients. In the older subjects, there was an increase in serum 25-hydroxyd concentrations, folate, and vitaminB12; this increased their serum 25hocystee concentrations as well as improved bone denition. This could lead to a reduced risk of fractures. A double blind trial was performed in 195 volunteers aged 50-85 years who had no history or hypertension, anemia, asthma, cancer, or cardiovascular disease. They were assigned to receive 1,000 microg of vitamin B 12, 1000 microg Vitamin B-12 plus 400 microg Folc acid or placebo for 12  weeks. Brain function was better in the placebo groups than in those who received only 500mg of vitamins B 12 alone or that in combination by folicacin. No significant change in brain function was seen in either group. Furthermore, consumption of breakfast cereal with 440microg florc acid, 1.8mg vitamin B 6, or 4.8mg vitamine B 12 did not improve brain function.

After a period of 10 months, subjects in both groups show significant improvement in their performance on tasks that require substantial executive control. The results suggest that exercise may be beneficial for older adults because it improves muscle strength, cardiovascular fitness, blood pressure, and mood. This paper also discusses the use of resistance training to prevent bone fragility among elderly women who are not on an ""electrified-restrained"" diet. It is reported that some overweight and obese people can improve bloodpressure and arterial stiffening by participating in regularly combined exercise.

We find that early death is associated with recurrent strokes but that late death or dependability are also associated with elevated blood pressure. Acute strokes are more likely to be fatal than non-fatal ones because of the increased risk of complications from presumed brain edemation. The rate for recurring strokes increases by 4.2 percent for each 10 mmHg increase in blood pressure over 150 mmhg. This association appears to be present in both acute and long-term events. Hemipartesis occurs the most common disabling disorder caused by stroke. In animals, dexteroamphetoamine has been reported to improve motor recovery after stroke.

Strength training might be a good strategy for schools because it reduces the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in young children. A previous study showed that vigorous physical activity was associated with better blood pressure than moderate physical activity. This study furthermore examined the relationship between physical activity on a scale of one-hundredth percentile and the relation between exercise and blood pressure across different age groups. The results suggest that vigorous activities are more likely to be associated with improved blood pressure when compared to less vigorous activities.

A prospective cohort study of 731 healthy workers aged 70-years shows that heavy lifting and heavy standing predicts low back pain more strongly than those without it. In addition, women have higher risk of developing long-lasting neck pain because of their high body mass Index, frequent neck expansion during the workday, and high mental distress. The results suggest that some factors may be potential targets for intervention to prevent back pain from becoming chronic. This study investigates whether depression arouses back pain when used as a predictor of disease severity in twins. It was found that depressed symptoms were associated with increased probability of back pain among twins who had poor education and poor fitness levels. However, this effect was not observed in other studies. Two studies examined the relationship between leisure time activities and low back Pain in elderly people. One showed that young men and women engaged in light or vigorous physical activity were less likely to develop back pain after one year; the other showed no significant association between these two activities. Another study examined the effects of physical activity upon back pain by using an objective instrument. Results showed that physical activity protects against future back pain even though it increases the risk of subsequent pain.

We conclude that both resistance training and balance and tone exercises are more likely to help save health care resources and provide better health outcome for falls than either class. This paper also discusses the use of fall avoidance education in primary care. It was found that there were no differences in mortality or hospital costs between the control and intervention group.

The effect of these preloads is not entirely different between younger and older subjects. Both groups consume higher amounts of energy during the first three days of the experiment. After eating, both hunger and energy are directly related to Antral area but not blood-glucagon. This suggests that there may be a relationship between age and gastric distention. A decrease in appetite is associated with slowing of Gastric Emptition. Aging is also associated with increased concentrations of choecystesinin, GLP1, and PYL.

Twenty patients are treated with 15mg of vitamin K2, and the other 20 patients receive only 10mg in addition to their usual dose of 15mcg of OPG. The results show that the reduction in Osteocalcin induces bone loss. A double blind, placebo controlled trial is performed for older people with a History of Vascular Disease. After six months, the levels of Vitamin K rise in the intervention arms compared to those of placebo. No change in endometrial function was seen; however, there was no improvement in pulse waves velocity. Six months later, the level of UcC increased in elderly women. This indicates that some degree of deficience in their diet may be responsible for the increase in UcOc. However, it does not seem to reflect any changes in bone formation or fracture risk. These studies aim to investigate whether high-intension training can prevent bone losses in healthy female endurance athletes.

In addition , the study shows that allocation to the deworming group does not influence student progress , as the re- analysis shows clearly no evidence of a difference in examination performance between deworming and control groups.7,8 In the context of the global evidence base , there is only one other study that has examined school attendance with no obvious effect shown.4 Given all these uncertainties , we simply do n’t know if there is truly an effect on school attendance from the data , in taking all these factors into account formally in a GRADE analysis .4 But what weakens the case of deworming still further is that there is now quite good evidence of no effect for most of the main outcomes ( Figure 1 ) , including nutritional status , haemoglobin , cognition and school performance .

In this study, 30 men were randomly assigned to either immediate nor delayed circumcision during September 2010 or November 2011 in order to assess changes in their sexual function after circumcision. They had a mean and median Epidemiological Score before and after they had circumcised. A statistically significant increase in the score was observed with a P0.001 significance. However, it could be interpreted only as a ""justification"" for circumcision when men have prematurely enjaculated. This study also includes a report from the Global On-line Sexuality Survey that describes the prevalence of premature earculation in the United States as of 2011-2012. Although there are no known risk factors for prematureness, most men do not experience any such risk factor. Men with early-onset earcuration tend to have more than one type of disease, including acquired earcubation. Oral therapy has been used more frequently than local anesthesia because of its efficacy over time. Furthermore, male circumcision does not seem to affect sexual function; however, some studies have suggested that skin tissue removed by circumcision may lead to differences in sexual functions.

17467103,"Although some systematic review s have not established an unequivocal benefit of physical training , most authors report a benefit for patients with chronic pain or fatigue .","This paper describes a novel intervention for chronic fatigue patients. It is based on the use of evidence-based instructions to encourage exercise in patients suffering from chronic fatigue. In this study, patients receive two treatment sessions and follow up calls with a comprehensive education pack explaining the role of disturbed physiological regulation in their fatigue symptoms. The results show that patients improve physical function when they are treated with evidenced based explanations for their symptoms. A score of 25 or an increase at the SF 36 physical functioning sub scale was obtained after four months of treatment. After three months, 21 patients droppedout; mainly from these intervention groups. In addition, no significant differences were observed between the three group's medical care.

The results of this study indicate that the Dermatological Life Quality Index, the Shortform 36, and the European Quality of Life Questionnaire are highly correlated in terms of changes in clinical outcomes. They also suggest that the severity of the score is more dependent on severity than on time. A trial of transanal endoscing for colon cancer has been performed. It was found that patients improved their quality of life at least three months after surgery. This improvement could be due to the use of the EuroQuoL 5D as a measure of health-related quality of living. However, it is not possible to predict survival by using only medical information. For example, we have examined the effect of panitumamab on progression free survival in children with acute lymphoblama.

Third, studies have shown that chronic heart disease has declined considerably in Canada since April 1994. Coronary heart diseases have declined greatly in Canada over the previous decade. Although evidence-based treatments have been used to treat these conditions, little is known about their efficacy. To increase uptake of proved efficacious medicines in patients with severe coronary disease, we propose a multifaced quality improvement intervention using patient- specific reminders at the pointof care as well as one-page instructions from local opinion leaders. These statements lead to rapid care improvements but do not lead to any significant change in blood pressure or lipoprotein levels. Next, three studies examine the effectiveness of a combination of primary care physician visits, nurse recalls, and follow-up by doctors. First, a trial was designed to assess the effects upon prescribing lipid reduction drugs. It found no effect on care of people with myocaral infacultation or heart failure. Secondly, if physicians were involved in a large scale national health system, they could participate in such a program. Thirdly, another study was designed specifically to evaluate whether implementing a single quality improvement tool would improve the quality management of patients suffering from acute coronary disorder.

The evidence that the outcome of fluoxetine trials varied according to whether this drug was used as a new compound or a reference one suggests the presence of bias","In a double blinded, parallel study of 40 depressed patients, the efficaciousness and safety of either fluoxetine nor imipramine are compared. Pramiproexole helps safely alleviate symptoms of depression by 1.0mg per day; however, side effects are more frequent in this group than in the other two groups. A multi-centre study compares tianeptin with fluoxetine for patients with mild to severe depression. Both drugs exhibit good efficaciacy but have some side effects. The Hamilton Depression Rating Score is lower in both groups. There is no difference between adherence or efficacy when adherence is calculated using the percentage of Days when the correct dosage is taken out from the medication container. Two dimensions of Compliance/ dropouts and Adherence are investigated in patients suffering from Major Depressive disorder. Both treatment regimens demonstrate comparable antidepressionant effectiveness. Antidepressant agents such as trazonine and omepramin show similar efficability in treating major depressive conditions. However, there are significant differences in the severity of adverse events among the two groups: nausea and vomiting are more frequently reported in the omeprimin group than those in the paroxitine group.",0.9960632582885216

The subjects perform better during the initial six weeks and then at three months' follow-up. There are no significant differences among groups at later points. In this study, Dr. Barlow compares two approaches: the direct anterior technique for total hip surgery and the posterior approach for arthroscopic total hip replacement. Both approaches lead to improved functional results after 6 weeks but there are still some complications due to the direct approach.

The results suggest that it is possible to use these two drugs together to improve peripheral vascular diseases. A double blind placebo controlled trial was performed in Spanish patients with leriche-fontainestage II peripheral arterial disease. It was found that they were better tolerated than those treated by placebo. This study also describes a novel intervention in patients with ""peripheral vascular disorder"" who were given either extra virgin olive oils or fish oil for three months. These patients showed improved blood levels and reduced susceptibility toward oxidation. They also showed improvements in their plasma lipid profiles. Their changes in lipoprotein composition seemed to be related to changes in HDL content. Both groups showed significant increases in polyunstained fatty acids. The effect seems to be independent of alteration in treatment interaction. Two different studies have been conducted: one concerning atherosis and another concerning the effect of fats on heart disease.

The results of the trial are as follows: 1) Walking time increases rapidly after exercise; 2) Walking distance decreases rapidly after two months of exercise; and 3) Walking speed increases rapidly during the first two months but does not significantly change at the final two months. A short-term exercise program might be preferable to longer ones for patients with persistent claudicious disease. Two studies have been conducted on patients with intermittent paternal artery disease. First, we examine the effect of supervised exercises on walking ability in patients who have intermittent clacudication. Second, we compare home-based exercises to those that use supervised training.

We find that walking does not alter blood pressure or body composition, but there are no differences between single-brought walkers and accumulated walksers. A further study is performed to determine whether short bouts can improve cardiovascular health in Latinos as compared to one long bout of vigorous exercise. The results suggest that accumulated shorter bouts may be an effective option for busy workers who want to incorporate exercise into one's lifestyle. This study compares two different exercise regimens: a ""long-bout"" group which performs a single interval of continuous exercise; and a more rapid-paced group with only three short exercises per day. Both groups show significant increases in heart rate reserve and weight loss. These results support our hypothesis that exercise accumulates in several short rounds of exercise has similar effects than one continuous bout regarding weight outcomes.",0.9786369300309443

The results suggest that gallstone disease may be caused by an overly active mineral content and that patients with mixed stones have more severe defects than those with cholesterol or mixed stones. Although laparostomy has become the preferred method for treating gallstones, it is still debated whether it is appropriate to perform such a procedure. A prospective open-label trial compares the cost of laparcostomie with that of conventional open choecytectomy in patients with chronic gallstone diseases. This study also examines the effect of routine Intraoperative Cholangiography upon the risk of acute bilary pain. It was found that there were no major complications after laparscostomization; however, some patients experienced significant chronic pain during their follow-up. After laparopstomie, patients had better pain but did not suffer any further complications.

These measures relate to aspects of health highly relevant to these patients. A continuous type score was used to diagnose complex regional pain syndrome; however, it was not accepted as an accurate measure of severity because there were no discernible signs or symptoms. Thus, the CSS corresponded well between critic diagnoses and dichotomiemous diagnoses. Pain intensity is often measured on an eleven-point pain intensity numeric rating scale where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain. However, studies have shown that changes from baseline can lead to significant reductions in pain intensity. To date, there has been no reliable estimates for clinically important differences across pain studies.

He concludes by identifying three predictors that will help predict future uses of alternative medicine: more education, poorer status, and a holisticorientation to health. The first prediction emerges from a written survey of 1035 men who have been in the U.S. for at least one year. The results suggest that there is a strong preference for alternative medicine among those who do not find conventional medicine to be very effective. A second prediction emerged from an observational study of 100 men with prostatic symptoms who were treated with saw palmeto. This trial was designed to assess the effects upon urinary symptoms of men with lower Ury Tract symptoms.

Thus, school age sport skills and fitness are not necessary for preventive measures against injury. The present study investigates whether assigning shoes based upon the shape of ""the bottom of thefoot"" influenced injury risks in Air Force basic military training. It found that ankle injuries were common among soldiers and other vigorousally active population but little known about theircause. Soldiers completed one year of pre-training surveys concerning physical characteristics, occupational factors, lifestyle characteristics, and previous injury before deployment. They reported that they experienced only one or two injuries during their first year of training. However, these reports did not reveal any differences in injury risk among men and women.

A further study suggests that vitamin D and caiusculosis may be useful for treating vitamin deficience in non- western immigrants. This study also compares the effect of sunlight exposure with vitamin D. It shows that both treatments improve blood concentrations but do not change physical performance or functional limitations. Another study examines whether combined vitamind and calcium supplementing can improve insulin  sensiton, insulin Secretion, and cell function in children at risk of Type 2 diabetes. Both studies show no changes in body composition or health before or after adjusted for potential confounding factors.

It is possible that the continuing refinement of the ToM model will lead to better interventions which have a greater impact on development than those investigated to date","In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to treating children with an ""autism spectrum disorder"" by using music therapy as a means of improving their social skills. They describe three studies: 1) A controlled trial on joint attention in young children; 2) A new multicomponent social skill intervention for infants with autism; and 3) A pilot study of a parent education program for children who are at least two years old. The results suggest that early intervention may be more cost effective than regular care. These studies also include a series of small-scale studies designed to evaluate the effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of different types of music therapy. First, we examine effects of musical therapy on social skills in pre-kindergarty children with audacious diagnoses. Second, we assess the effect of imitation training on children with high-functionalitying autism.

28387560,"The sensitivity and specificity of commonly implemented sideline assessment tools are generally good to very good , especially for symptom scores and cognitive evaluations performed within 48 hours of injury , and they are improved when a baseline evaluation is available for comparison .","Brain Snack: Concusses are a big deal in the U.S. because they're so common and can happen at any time of the year. So here's why: neurocognition testing is used to track concussessions, which means that players who have had previous concusions are even more likely to get injured again than those without them. This study uses a group of elite Australian college football players to follow up on their injury history during the season. The results show that there's an association between having a previous concursion and getting injured again. Plus, we know that some guys with a past history of multiple concudings might be more likely for future injuries than others with no history. Also, this study suggests that playing with symptoms may lead to slower recovery from head injury than other players with fewer prior concuddings. A pilot study was designed to document the Nature and temporal profiles of the clinicalsymptoms of acute sport related concuseds. We found that headache was the most frequently reported symptom but that it was also associated with slow recovery. In addition, our study suggests how adding rapid number-naming could improve our ability to recognize concoussed athletes upon the sideline. Another study was conducted to evaluate the recovery curvature of patients who incur sportrelated concusacks from repeated serial tests of neuropsychlogical and posturgraphy testing. It showed that both severity and length of symptoms were significantly affected by age and gender. Finally, another study was performed to assess the reliability of using the Glasgow ComA scale as a predictor of brain function after concushed games. Our results suggest that mild concuctions should be returned to game immediately after injury. Next, we examine the relationship between head impact and speed of reaction time following concusursion. Athletic players suffering from concusures report worse symptoms within two hours after concupssion than control subjects.

Advancing the volume of enteral feeds at a slow rate results in several days of delay in establishing full enteral feeds and may increase the risk of invasive infection","In this study, we examine the effects of feeding with two-hourly or three-hundred-mild intervals on preterm newborns. The results indicate that infants who receive these intervals have a reduced time to achieve complete enteral feeding but no increased adverse events. We conclude that there is no evidence of increased risk for necrotizing Enterocolitis in early-onset infants. A case control study has been performed in which infants are matched by birth weight and then treated with either early or late feeds.

Conclusion On the basis of available evidence , the use of root canal sealer increases the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth .
Regarding the comparisons among the sealers , no conclusions could be drawn for the superiority of one sealer type to another .","In this study, the effect of resin-filled root canals on fracture resistance is compared. The results show that roots filled with either Resilon or Epiphany are more resistant to fracture than those filled by guttapercha. A new thermoplastic polymer, Resilonic, performs better as a sealer than guttat-percha but does not allow the bonding material to attach to dentin walls thus forming an ""monblock."" This study compares in vitro and in laboratory fracture resistance of tooth filling materials using three different methods: 1) hydrophilic; 2) novel Cpoint system; and 3) EndoSquenceBC sealer. Both systems exhibit higher fracture resistance than their control groups. However, there is no significant difference in the strength required to fracture all three groups.

In this study, we examine the effect of six months of solution-decorated HA on the migration of total knee prosthetics. After two years, there is no significant difference in migratence between the groups; however, at four years, only one patient has taken any tablet after surgical intervention. This suggests that it may be possible to reduce loosening during the first year. A comparison of three different kinds of fixation methods for knee replacements shows that they show greater motility than cemented or noncemented designs. Prosthesis movement in bone occurs frequently in uncemented complete knee arthrostry. Cemented implants do not move as quickly as those with screws because they need time to grow into the irregularities of their implant.

The results suggest that a healthier and more active lifestyle can prevent new cases of Type 2 disease from occurring. This paper also discusses the association between weight loss and increased risk of heart disease in newly diagnosed patients with Type 2 who have not changed their health behavior during the first year after diagnosis. We conclude that improved health behavior is associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease because it is related to the frequency with which people change their habits.

The results indicate that power training produces greater gains in muscle strength than resistance training. In this study, fifty-seven older adults were assigned to either high-power or slow-velopity resistance training and were compared to two control groups. Both groups showed significant increases in leg power but no significant changes in quality of life. A novel form of weight vest exercise was used to compare the benefits of three different resistance training programs on isometry force, power, and performance in older people. Two resistance training groups were selected: one aimed at improving muscle power and another at increasing muscular strength. It was found that both groups produced significant improvements in body composition, quality of live, and balanceconfidence. However, these differences were not meaningful for future studies.

We find that those living in warmer climates also have higher fall rates than those living within the city. Fall incidents seem to be associated with the amount of home assistance they receive, but there is no association between the frequency of falls and temperature. This suggests that fall prevention may be an important consideration when planning home care for elderly people with acute or debilitating health problems. A population-based cohort studies are performed on people age 65 and over from 1990 to 2000. There are 10 992 fall related fracture cases out of 2390 per hundred thousand person years.

The results suggest that cueing increases the frequency of drug craving but not the severity of the disease. This suggests that Cue-induced behavior may lead to longer-term use of alcohol or other drugs. A prospective cross-examination of 181 young adults aged 16-20 was performed using performance measures from the Rey auditoratory verbal learning test. After controlling for age, quantity, frequency, and age of initial use, they showed similar memory decline after controlling for degree of exposure to tobacco.

The risk allele is associated with higher value of body mass, lower waist circumference, and skin folds over time. Over two years follow-up, no interaction was observed between genotype or intervention. Children with the allele have greater increases in body mass and fat mass than those with the other allele. This association is confirmed by the fact that the A1 allele has a higher risk of overweightobesities during growth. We conclude that the common single nucleome polymorphismm in the Fat Mass and Obesity-Associated gene is frequently associated with an increase in the risk of obesity. However, the knowledge about a potential altering effect of theFTO gene on change in body weigh achieved by life intervention is limited. For example, studies have shown that the disease-causing allele can lead to significant weight loss when compared to the general population's diets.

Cannabinoids were associated with an increased risk of short-term AEs","Incontinence Diaries. A prospective double blind trial compares butyrophinone analogol to synthetic cannibinoid Nabilone in patients with Multiple Sclerosis. Both treatments show significant reductions in the adjusted episode rate from baseline to final treatment. The results are suggestive that cannanbinoids may help relieve pain in patients who have multiple sclerical disease. This is also in contrast to other studies where no difference has been seen in the severity of spastiity. Cannaninoids seem to be more effective in treating multiple-scracked patients than they are in treating placebo-controlled patients. Two different approaches are described: one using cannabine extract and another using drona binol. One uses cannibinol, while the other uses ""dronabol"" as an add-on for opioids. These two trials demonstrate that cannizandol does not cause any side effects; however, there are some mild side effects.",0.9945410007170863

Adiposity levels were lower among preschool children engaged in more ( moderate-to- ) vigorous PA compared with their peers , but no associations  between  PA and BMI or waist circumference were found","In this paper, we identify the most important predictors of physical activity in young children. We use a Swiss pre-schooler's health study as a basis for our analysis. The results indicate that time spent outdoors is associated with total physical activity and moderate-tovigorous behavior, while time spent indoors is associated only with gross motor skill. Children from two parent families have higher levels of TPA than girls; they spend less time sitting sedentally than those who live with two parents. Time spent outside is also associated with both TPA and SB. A multidimensional sets of correlates are identified among these three domains. Age, sexe, and activity temperament are the most influential ones. These factors can serve to define targeted groups or become useful targets for change into future treatments.",0.998452953909978

BODY-Q scales were responsive to measuring clinical change associated with weight loss 2 years after bariatric surgery","This paper presents the results of a study on the quality of life of patients who undergone total knee or hip arthrostry. The aim of this study was to develop an instrument to assess the effects of weight reduction on health status in patients who had undergone surgery. It was found that the IwqOL-Lite, a short, easy-to-use instrument, was highly sensitive and could be used as a stand-alone measure of quality control in patients with severe obesity.",0.4289552048469145
29635250,"Several studies of good quality demonstrated changes in lifestyle habits arising from the provision of genetic interventions .
The most promising lifestyle changes were changes in nutrition .
Conclusions : It is possible to facilitate behaviour change using genetic testing as the catalyst .","In this study, we examine the effect of genetic testing on physical activity in a group of European adults. The results suggest that there is no association between baseline physical activity and genotype-based risk for developing obesity. Further studies are needed to confirm whether knowledge of Fto risk has an impact on behavior change. This paper discusses the use of genetic information to predict health behavior changes. It describes a two arm trial with eligible smoking patients who received either a selfhelp manual or a genomic test. They were divided into three groups: 1) control group; 2) personalized group; and 3) non-personalized group. After six months, there were significant improvements in objectively measured physical activities level, moderate physical activity level, andsedentary Time. These changes were similar throughout all groups. A further RCT was needed to determine how long-term psychological and behavioural effects of genomic risk tests could be associated with these new approaches.",0.9544816278257366
26053004,"The review found that multifaceted interventions , addressing several non-adherence factors , were comparatively more effective in improving medication adherence and glycaemic target in patients with T2D than single strategies .
However , interventions with similar components and those addressing similar non-adherence factors demonstrated mixed results , making it difficult to conclude on effective intervention strategies to promote adherence .
Educational strategies have remained the most popular intervention strategy , followed by behavioural , with affective components becoming more common in recent years .
There is a noticeable shift in the literature from using single to multifaceted intervention strategies addressing a range of factors impacting adherence to medications .","In this study, a mixed-race group of older African Americans is assigned to an ""integrative care intervention"" or usual care for their type 2 diabetes. The patients are divided into two groups: the control group receives short-message services and the intervention group receive long-term telephone calls. Both groups have significant changes in blood glucose levels but no significant differences on self-repair or quality of life. This study also examines the use of telemedicine to improve patient adherence to medication over a period of three months. It was found that both groups had significant reductions in Hb1c levels as well as improvements in weight, body massindex, blood pressure, and health-related qualities. These results suggest that there may be a need for more evidenced-based approaches to improving disease management among African Americans.",0.679374884571848
31399113,"Conclusion Costs for repeated treatment of post-orthodontic enamel damages produced by conventional vestibular fixed appliances may easily exceed the initially higher costs associated with lingual orthodontic treatment .
Judged economically in the long term , lingual MB Tx may be considered as a more cost-effective solution for a correction of malocclusion","In this study, Wuthering Heights et al.1 uses a novel method to assess the effect of two different types of brackets on white spot lesion formation in orthodontic patients. The results suggest that there is little difference in the frequency and severity of decalcified teeth adjacent to or beneath the brackets when compared to other types of appliances. This study also establishes that ""subbracket"" lesions are less frequent than subbracked lesions because they are not associated with appliance type. White spot lesies are particularly common during orthodontic treatment. Although fluoride has been used as a preventive measure against these lesions, no significant differences have been found between the two groups.",0.9977838087785913

Calcium channel blockers were superior to other drugs for the prevention of stroke .
For the prevention of heart failure , calcium channel blockers were inferior and diuretics were superior to other drug classes .
INTERPRETATION Blood pressure lowering significantly reduces vascular risk across various baseline blood pressure levels and comorbidities .","This study focuses on the association between blood pressure and various cardiovascular disease, including stroke, heart failure, and angina. The results of this study suggest that treatment with antihypertension may be beneficial for elderly patients who are at risk for both acute and chronic diseases. In addition, it suggests that hypertensives have a higher risk of death from all causes than those with lower blood pressure.

The role of PMRT in women with 1 to 3 positive axillary lymph nodes is unclear .
Locoregional PMRT is generally not recommended for women who have tumours that are less than 5 cm in diameter and who have negative axillary nodes .","In this chapter, the authors present a series of studies on breast cancer. The first is a prospective observational study of two hundred women with nodes positive after mastectomy who receive either post-masstectomy and/or adjuvant regimens of eight courses of caft or six courses of doxocin. After 10 years, there is little difference in disease free or overall survival between the three groups. There is evidence that patients with negative node involvement have better survival than those with only positive nodes. A second study compares the use of internal Mammary Chains as part of the target volume for breast tumors. This study uses a mixed-effects model to determine whether internal Mamary chains are associated with greater local relapses during follow up. It was observed that both types of treatment resulted in improved patient survival. However, it was found that the number of ""positive nodes"" were more important in terms of disease-free or total survival. Post-masticide and adjuvenient regimens did not lead to any improvement in patient survival but increased the risk of distant recurrance.

27325129,"INTERPRETATION We found weak correlation between signs , symptoms and testosterone levels , uncertainty about what threshold testosterone levels should be considered low for aging men and wide variation in estimated prevalence of the condition .
It is therefore difficult to extrapolate the method of diagnosing pathologic hypogonadism in younger men to clinical decisions regarding age-related testosterone decline in aging men","In this first study, we examine the association of endogenously testosterone concentrations with health in men. Men with low levels are at a higher risk of dying from all causes than those with high levels. This study is a population-based observational survey that includes 1,475 black, Hispanitic, and white males between the  age of 30'79 years. The mean age was 47.3 yr. Free testosterone levels were less than 300ng/Dl; free testosterone was less than 5g/dl. Asymptomatic men had symptoms as follows: low Libido, Erectile Dysis, Osteporoseis or Fracture, or Two or More of the Nonspecific symptoms. Prevalency of symptomatical androgen deficientiency was not significantly associated with race and ethnicity. Next, we investigate whether low testosterone level affects physical performance and falls risk in older adults. We use a follow-up sample of 2587 men aged 55 to 89 years who have been followed up for four years. All men were evaluated with detailed history, physical examination, international Index of ectorile function, and serum Hormone Measures. Serum Hormonium levels and disease pathologies were compared among these men. No significant differences were found between the mean FSH, LH, and prollactin levels. Later, we examined the relationship between Adam Questionnaire and sexual hormone levels in aging Spanish men. These men showed no signs of late-onset hypergonadeism but did show a marked increase in the frequency of symptoms. Finally, we used a longitudinal cohort of 3,200 middle-aged European men over the age of 40 - 80 years to establish age-related trends for serum levels of testicles and relatedhormones. Age-related declines in both free andalbuminbound testosterone were steeper when compared with cross-sectionals trend. Type 2 Diabetes mellitateus is associated with lower total serum testosterone. There is little consensus on what constitutes ""the lowest level of T within the boundariesof normality.""

Leptin was also significantly decreased while adiponectin was significantly increased .
Although the level of metabolic hormones changed after bariatric surgery , they were not statistically significant .
Inflammation indicators were significantly decreased .
Significant reduction was also detected in PAI-1 and sICAM-1 .
Conclusions Bariatric surgery is beneficial in morbidly obese patients .
Although treating obesity in a surgical way may cause some complications , the weight loss is generally safe and effective","In this study, we examine the association between obesity and markers of inflammatory and Endothelal activation. We find that weight loss is associated with improved blood levels of phospholipin polyunstained fatty acids, which may lead to an increase in the level of these fatty acid in patients with atherosis. This study also investigates the role of a diponectin, one of the most abundant fat-soluble peptide's, in improving insulinsensitivity in humans. The aim here is to determine how different obesity spectra affect chronic kidney disease. A prospective cohort study has been performed on 1162 subjects free from chronic renal disease. It was found that those with a normal body mass were more likely to have a reduced risk of developing chronic kidney diseases. These results suggest that being a healthy weight is not sufficient to protect against such conditions. Furthermore, rats are used as controls for weight loss by bariatic surgery. They show significant reductions in body mass index, high-sensitivity c-reactiveprotein, interleukin 6, IL-6, and tumor necroseis factor- alpha.

The increase is greater in subjects who are anaemic at the start of the trial and lower in malarial hyperendemic areas and in those consuming iron-fortified food .","In this paper, the authors describe a doubleblind trial in which six-year-old children were given either an iron solution or a dual fortified salt mixture of Fe and Iodine. The results indicate that both groups have significant differences in their pretreatments on the mental and physical development scales. A study is presented in which infants are assigned to either daily iron or weekly iron treatment. Children receive one dose of iron after three months; they gain greater height and weight gains than those who receive only a daily iron regimen. Iron supplementations improve iron status by improving hemoglobin levels and ferritiin concentrations. Hematology and behavior measures are obtained before and after each intervention. Anemia is abolished among these two groups but no change in prevalence occurs in the placebo control group. This suggests that iron deficient anemia may be associated with indicatorsof chronic undernutriation and multiplemicronutrient deficiencies.

In healthy volunteers, short-term treatment reduces the identification of negative emotions and increases the recall of positive emotions. Short-term reboxing does not improve this effect; however, it does increase the recognition of happy and disgusted faces. This suggests that early in the treatment may be beneficial for depressed patients. Another study uses functional magnetic resonance to map the brain systems involved in categorizing and laterrecognizing positive and negative features in healthy volunteers. Depressed patients receive a single dosage of re boxetine but show no change in their scores of mood or symptoms.

He concludes that ""adjusting for known progestitic covariate can leadto substantial increases in powers."" This chapter is divided into three sections: 1) abstracts and 2) studies. The first section discusses the use of grade-d activity and grade-examined exposure as treatment options for patients with chronic back pain. A double blinded trial compares the effectiveness of physical therapy alone or TBC augmentation with GX or GA for patients who have elevated pain-related fear. There are no differences in four weeks and six months for reduction of pain intensity, pain catatstrophizing, and physical decline. Six months after pain severity, there was only a small decrease in pain intensity. However, it was associated with greater reductions in Fear-avoidant beliefs and pain Catastrophing. These results suggest that pregabaln, which is an effective antihypervalgesic adjumvant, does not improve important outcomes related on the development of long- term postoperative pain. Two studies relate to acute and persistent pain after neurosurgical procedures. One study investigates the effect of preventive morphine administration on acute and long time posttoromy pain; the other examines the effects of low dose ketamine administered preoperatively before surgery. Both groups showed marked improvement in pain scores during the first two days after surgery. Although both groups had similar pain scores at different time periods, they were found to show signs of nerve injury. Another study uses a novel patient education booklet designed to reduce fears about physical activity and return them to normal behavior. It shows that those who received the educational booklet improved their ability to control lumbar Neutral Zone by improving muscle activation pattern and increasing spinal stability. They also showed improvements in pain score and patient satisfaction when compared to controls. Other studies examined the benefits of exercise and prevention of chronic pain after surgical procedures.

In this paper, we describe the effects of two week of growth hormone treatment on energy consumption, body mass, and skin oxidation. We conclude by examining changes in bone mineral density in adulthood with growth Hormone deficiencies. Thirty patients were studied for age ranges from 51 years to 63 years. They were assigned to receive human growth hormone at a subcutaneous dose of 10g/kg or placebo. Bone mineral density was determined by an echocardiography assessment. Body composition measured by dual energetic impedance techniques. Free Iglum-I levels increased during the 14 day GH administration. Insulin binding protein 1, IGFbinding Protein 1, and total Glycerol were measured. Serum Leptin Levels and Energy expenditure were investigated. Biochemical markers of bones turnover were investigated in twenty-nine normal male subjects aged 21 to 30 years. Ostecalcin and procollage type I propeptide were investigated; resorption mark type I collagentelopeptidate was examined. Procollagen Type III and Ostecal Ligature Type III declined after days 42 and were not significantly higher than baseline on day 28. These results suggest that GH may be used as an aid in sports. This study investigates the role of growth hormonal therapy on bone formation in healthy adults. It is reported that rHhGH increases free T3, but does not affect bone mineral content. There are no significant differences between these three groups. Acute vascular function is studied in eight young healthy men. Hepatoprotection is improved when he is given rhG. Blood flow rises more rapidly while vascular resistance decreases. Resting Heart Rate increases to a comparable degree after rthGH.",0.9469361494512509

The results suggest that parathyroid Hormone is not associated with any change in metabolic control in type 2 patients. In this paper, we examine the effect of paraticicitol on inflammation and oxative stress in type two patients with chronic kidney disease. Paraticicitol does not affect either brachial or central aorttic augmentation but only improves markers of inflammation.

They conclude that it may be suitable for patients who are recently diagnosed with an unstable mental illness. The first study in this paper is a pilot study of a new self-monitory system for bipolar disorders using a personal smartphone. This trial was designed to evaluate the effect of daily use of smartphones on symptoms and function in patients with Bipolar disorder. It showed significant improvements in depressive or manic symptoms as well as improvement in quality of living. A further study is being conducted to compare the effects of short-lived text messages sent by a physician to weight loss in people with bipolar disease.

This suggests that early probiotic use may be effective in preventing these childhood illnesses. We conclude that early consumption of Lactobillus gg reduces the severity of acute atopic skin prick tests in children with a high risk for developing a topical disease at age 2 years. The results suggest that early Probiotic treatment during pregnancy does not seem to prevent or delay the development of such diseases. For example, studies have found that there is no difference in the severity among different age groups when it comes to symptoms of asthma.

29372708,Conclusion It seems that the use of flowable composite as a fissure sealing material can slightly increase the retention rate of sealants compared with conventional resin-based sealants,"In this chapter, the authors present a series of studies on different types of fillants used to seal teeth. First, they describe two restorative materials: Admira flow and Gr and Io flow; second, a fluoride filled material called Fissurt F that has been developed for use in children with deep pits. The first study compares the retention rate of three different fluid-based restorating materials against conventional sealants. They find that Fissure is most common among children due to deeper pits which need to prevent or restore. These studies suggest that fissure reduces the risks of caries prevention by using an ongoing school-based program. This study suggests that pit andfissure protects both permanent and child-derived morals more than fluorides alone. Aim and objective: This study examines the effect of resinmodified glass impregnated as a protective material over a conventional sealant. It shows that there are no significant differences between the caries preventive effects of these other treatments. Second, it investigates the efficiacy of flowable polyurethanes as cussure sealers in comparison to traditional sealants after 24 months. Third, it uses flowable composites as ""fissure"" sealants in young patients. Thirty four patients were selected from a population of 16 to 22 year olds who had at least 2 caries free per tooth. Each treatment was evaluated in relation to retention and the appearance of new caries lesions. After 3 months, all teeth were completely sealed with either flowable or unfilled product. At the conclusion of each treatment, only one tooth lost its remaining teeth. Finally, the results indicate that flowable Polyurethanenes do not perform well in guarding teeth against caries. However, further studies should be performed regarding how best to control caries development.",0.7934318459107115

Risk of bias was present in most studies , thus supporting the need for higher quality studies in this area to more conclusively underst and the role VD supplementation has on inflammatory pathways","The results of this study suggest that a high-serum 25-hydroxyvindal concentration is associated with an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. In contrast, the levels of 25-Hystericalvitamin D are significantly lower in men and women than those who have low levels. A1C values are slightly lower in the vitaminD group after one year; however, there are no significant differences between the two groups regarding blood pressure, fasting glucose, or insulin sension.

Very low- quality evidence indicates that short-term use of an EHF compared with a CMF may prevent infant CMA .
Further trials are recommended before implementation of this practice .We found no evidence to support prolonged feeding with a hydrolysed formula compared with a CMF for prevention of allergic disease in infants unable to be exclusively breast fed","In this study, we examine the effect of an infant formula containing whey milk on the risk of developing allergic disease in newborn infants. We compare the effects of two different feeding regimens: one that is exclusively breastfed during the first three days of life; and another that is only partially or entirely hydrolysed with cow's milk. The results suggest that the use of early-exposure to cow'milk does not lead to increased risk of asthma in the first two years of life. Atopic disease is found in 13% of preterm infant girls who are given either a protein-free placebo or a mixture of both. This suggests that brief early exposure may not increase the risks of asymptomatic disease in children at birth.

The first regimen consisted of deflazarcort, a potent anti-inflammatory that reduces side effects; the second included prednistone, which was more effective in improving muscle strength. Both regimens had significant improvements in their performance. After 9 months, however, there were only minor side effects: weight gain, cushingid appearance, and excessive body weight.

Students who eat quickly at their first two years of university are more likely not to become overweight. A study in western Sweden investigates the association between total and central obesity, as well as the influence of social-economic factors, lifestyle, and dental anxiety. It was found that patients with greater than 10 teeth had an increased risk of being overly obese. Another study in southern Brazil examined whether pooreroral status were associated with excessive body fat. This study used a cross sectional sample of older South American adults.

They conclude that age 1 month and longer surgery are independently associated with such complications. A prospective open cohort study was conducted in 838 adult patients who had undergone coronary or valve surgery between January 1991 and December 2002 to define the risks for development of these infections. After follow-up, 22 patients had developed either mediastinate or endo Cardiotis. The results suggest that older people may be at greater risk of developing a surgical wound infection than younger people. This study can be useful in designing and implementing preventive measures against a high-risk group of patients. These studies will help reduce the number of patients who develop a deep or superficial wound infection during their post-surveillance period.",0.6421987916432365

They conclude that both are effective in treating these patients. The first study is a double blinded multicentre study to compare the effectiveness and tolerateability of an IV infusion of one dihydrophosphodie calcium channel blocker: either nidipine orfelodipine; it was found that both drugs lowered patient's blood pressure adequately within more than 90 percent of the patients. Both drugs reduced blood pressure sufficiently in more than90 % of them and were well toleranced. The second study involves a single intrathenous 2-horse infusion from enalprilat 1mg after acute pulmonary edemation.

Promising blood pressure reductions were noted in multimodal interventions which addressed lifestyle","In this study, we examine the effects of exercise training on walking ability in patients who have suffered a stroke. Aerobic and strenth training are more effective than single-modality exercise for improving walking ability. Strenth significantly improves walking distance and gait velocity but does not improve any of the other measures of physical fitness. We conclude that cycle training is superior to resistance training because it produces larger effects than both single-modality exercises. Two studies describe the use of an integrated care program for stroke survivors. One describes a system of education and support designed to reduce risk factors while the other describes ""integrated care for the reduction of secondary stroke."" The first study uses a multifactorial model to predict the cumulative benefits of multiple strategies for preventring recurrent or fatal strokes in patients with acute stroke. This approach was associated with improved health status and quality of life. The second study compares a short-term intervention for African American stroke survivors to a long-term regimen of behavior modification. It showed significant improvements in several domains including neuromotor function, severe complications, quality oflife, and management of risk for common post-stroke complications and repeat stroke. The third study investigates whether enhanced secondary precautions may influence readiness to change habits after minor stroke or Transient Ischemia attack.

A community health worker led lifestyle intervention could lead to more efficacy in this population. Two studies are presented: 1) An African American patient with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus was enrolled in either an intense or low intensity intervention group; 2) A peer advisor and advanced practice nurse were used as mentors for these patients. These two groups had similar improvements in selfefficacy but did not show any significant differences in quality of life or health care use. Both groups maintained improved health outcomes after 12 months. They also showed improvement in waistcircference, disease control, and other measures of health satisfaction.

In this study, all patients in the ICU were treated with either percutaneous drainage or elective surgery between 2001 and 2007. Morbidity, mortality, and long term outcome were examined in both groups. After laparoscopic draining was performed, there was no difference in conversion rate but only minor complications. The results showed that delayed laparoscostomy improved the patient's condition although it did not reduce the total length of stay. A prospective study was conducted to compare early laparcostomie with delayed interval surgery for acute calculus disease. This trial was followed by a parallel group trial to determine whether early or delayed operation would be more appropriate for acutely calculous disease. It was found that early treatment had a shorter overall hospital stay than delayed intervention. However, delays resulted in less time spent in the hospital as well as reduced morbidity. Early surgical treatment was preferred because it was easier to follow up on symptoms during the initial course of treatment. Later, however, we saw that delayed surgery offered significant advantages over conservative treatment.

He compares two different exercise regimens: high-intent resistance training with self-paced walking; and progressive resistance exercises that involve multiple repetitions per week. The results suggest that elderly people have greater muscle strength than they do in younger age groups. This study also examines the effect of resistance training to improve falls in older patients. A control group is assigned to either endurance or resistance training. Both groups show significant improvements in performance over six months. Two subjects develop radiculopathies during training. These changes are not associated with any change in functional task performance for either group. However, both groups report improvement in leg power and extenso strength. Muscle weakness does not appear to be strongly affected by metabolites after training.

It is shown that those who fall experience lower scores on Folstein's mini-mental state exam and higher declines in their daily living scores. Conclusions That lack of treatment differences suggests that residents of Long-term Care Facilities may require individual exercise intervention that can be adapted to changing needs. Three studies are presented: 1) An eight-week resistance training program increases muscle strength and nervemuscular performance as well as improved physical function in healthy old men and women. 2) A rand and ommized controlled trial investigates the effects an eight-month resistance strength training program on strength, endurance,mobility, and fall rate in older people with chronic impairmentStudiny 1: Bickering Over a twelve-month period, 6 months of exercise intervention and 6 months follow-up were conducted in 174 elders aged from 60 up to 87years. They were divided into two groups: one group was assigned to sit-and-omized exercises while the other was assigned only to walking or stretching exercises. After four months of vigorous activity, the participants showed significant gains in mobility, balance, gait, agility, and health perception. Results indicate that weightliftingtraining may be successful used in patients without airflow limitation. FFLTC, a home-based exercise program designed to improve strength",0.04542586012460139

The results indicate that the two groups have significant reductions in waist circumference, body weight, and blood pressure over a six-week period. This suggests that they may benefit from a lower-glyciaemic index diet as it reduces both fasting glucose and postprain and iary glyceremia. A further study investigates the effect of an elevated gycemic index on Type 2 diabetes. It was found that there were significant changes in Hb1c values but no significant differences in plasma concentrations between the two treatment groups. Another study examines the effects of changing the source of food on type 2 diabetic patients. Two different types of diets were studied: 1) a low GlyceMIC IX diet; and 2) a high GlyCII diet.

The results indicate that laparoses are associated with shorter post-operation lengths than stricturoplasty and that the barthel's score at discharge is independent predictor from the patient's disability status. Although more than three years of research has been dedicated to understanding the causes of adverse events in human wounds, no detailed studies have been undertaken to identify their specific characteristics. Adverse events occur only in the surgical setting; however, they are not as likely to cause death or injury as in the non-surgical setting.

There is a trend towards small reductions in nonfatal MI and cardiovascular death , though the clinical importance of such reductions is likely modest","The British Heart Study, a study of heart disease risk in middle-aged men and women, reports that levels of highdensity Lipoprotein cholesterol are associated with lower risk of Coronary Heart Disease. However, when the same analysis is used to calculate the relative risk of different types of cardiovascular events, the results vary considerably. In this case, there is an inverse relation between high-denish lipoprotein content and coronary chest disease risk. This relationship seems to have been observed in four studies: the Frambringham Heart Study; the Lipid Research Council Prevalence Morbidity Follow-up Trial; and the multiple Risk Factor intervention trial. A significant increase in high-Density LDL cholesterol was associated with increased risk of coronarion heart disease. When differences were eliminated, dalsceptiveness did not appear to be related to non-Cardinal Heart Disease Mortality. Although higher levels of low-denshing lipophosphoproteincholester transfer protein may reduce the risk for major cardiovascular event, it remains uncertain whether such treatment will improve outcomes.

The combination of a SERM with estrogen as a tissue selective estrogen complex ( TSEC ) is a new strategy for the prevention of bone loss and the treatment of climacteric symptoms .
This combination is particularly interesting from a clinical point of view , taking into account that estrogen alone did not increase breast cancer risk by the Women 's Health Initiative .
TSEC is hypothesized to provide the benefits of estrogen-alone therapy , with an improved tolerability profile because the SERM component can make possible the elimination of progestin .
The conclusion is that effectively , the combination of bazedoxifene and conjugated estrogens may be a promising alternative to hormone therapy for the prevention of osteoporosis and the treatment of postmenopausal symptoms in non-hysterectomized postmenopausal women","In this study, we describe the frequency and treatment of ""hot flushes"" in women from the early 1900s to the mid-1990s. We examine changes in bone turnover markers as a predictor for the reduction in risk of fractures in patients treated with risedronates. A telephone survey among 594 post-menopause women found that the frequency of hot flushing was 88 percent; surgical menopause showed the highest estrogen use rate. Two studies examined the relationship between bone turnover and fracture risk among postmenopanal women. The Fracture intervention trial reported an association between short- term change in biochemical markers of bone turn and hip, spine, and non-Spine fracture risks. This study suggests that greater reduction is associated with less fracture risk than those who have no prior use of estrogen. Women receiving three different doses of centrion or progestine were more likely to report symptoms of body or joints aches/palins than those not receiving any other treatment.

Two further studies were performed: one on dialysis subjects who received high-dose flax seed oil at a dose of 1 g/ day; and another on patients with chronic kidney failure who received low-dose alpha-Linolnic acid at 0.5 g daily. These studies suggest that fats such as flaxsoleed oil increase the levels of proinflammatory markers in hypercholesteric subjects. Flaxseseed oil also decreases the concentration of anti-inflammatory cell numbers. Furthermore, it increases the expression of G1S2, an important negative regulater of Lipolysis.

This study compares the knee injury assessment scale with the Western OsteoArtrtis Score, which has been used for younger and older patients with pain or stiffness. A significant improvement was seen in the quality of life measured on the Knee Injury and Osteostarthritis Outsidecome Score at six and 12 months. These results suggest that advanced practice therapists are working in these areas to help improve access to care for patients suffering from hip or knee pain. They also report improved exercise behavior and selfefficacy as well as improvements in cost and time spent stretching. Furthermore, they conclude that a supervised physiotherapist service will be more cost effective when compared with surgeons' services.",0.7843547431769591

Strengthening exercises performed in the neurologic population are not specific to the main muscle groups responsible for the power generation required for walking .
There is a predisposition for strength testing and strengthening exercises to focus on the knee flexors and extensors despite their relatively minor role during walking .","The effects of resistance training on strength in people with stroke are outlined. Aerobic and strenth training improve walking speed, gait pace, and muscle strength in patients with Down syndrome. In this study, the effect of progressive resistive training on leg muscles is examined. Both groups show significant improvements in upperlimb muscle strength as well as functional mobility. Two studies have been conducted to determine whether progressive-restraining training can be used to improve balance and function in people who have had an acute stroke. These studies include a trial using tae chi to improve postural controls in patients suffering from multiple sclerotic disease. Although exercise has been widely advocated by health care practitioners, few studies have investigated the efficability of supervised whole-body vibratory training for stroke survivors. This study compares a home-based program with a regimen of conventional physical therapy and exercises for children with brain palsy. It shows that both groups show improved performance in terms of gross motor function and gait Speed. Children with cerebralpalsy also show improvement in their ability to walk and balance.",0.43321593976587647

In the validated cohort, the observed 10-year risk of heart attack was 6.60 percent in women and 9,28 % in men over 10 years. A cardiovascular diseaserisk algorithm was developed; in the validation cohort, there was a significant difference between the scores calculated by the Frammingham and AssiGN algorithms.

He uses the Physical Activity Score for the Elderlies as a measure of how much physical activity is performed in the last 7 days before interview. The outcome measures include time from recurring stroke, myocaral infusoration, and venous death. A pilot study has been conducted in China to determine whether an exercise intervention can reduce risk of first-time stroke. This trial results in improved blood pressure control in both groups. After 12 months, there was no significant difference in total lipoproteincholesterol levels or changes in body mass index. At follow-up, after six months, the change in blood pressure was markedly different in the intervention treatment group than in controls. Furthermore, it was found that weight loss was more successful in the overweight/obpressed patient group. These studies are divided into three parts: 1) case management; 2) self-management; and 3) education. First, we investigate whether ""an internet-based"" nurse led artery risk factor management program could increase long-term physical activity in patients with acute stroke. Second, we examine the effect of nurses' telephone-based preventive follow up on blood pressure. We conclude that this approach is more efficient than regular care at improving blood pressure by 12 months after discharge. Third, we assess the effectiveness of educational approaches for stroke patients who have mild stroke. They will be provided within the first week after their stroke. For example, they will provide information about secondary stroke prevention services and improve health behavior. Finally, these two strategies will further reduce the burden of stroke on primary care.",0.05508315325746762

The few non-pharmacological studies conducted employing cognitive orientated treatments and cognitive remediation therapy show promising results for the improvement of cognitive impairment in depression .","In this paper, the authors present a detailed description of suicidical thinking in depressed suicide attempters. They conclude that executive dysfunctions are associated with impaired memory performance and suggest that they may be state-dependent. Suicidal thought is related to poor executive functions but does not cause significant differences among patients with rmission and without recovery. The effects of three drugs on cognition before pharmacology have no effect on depression symptoms after treatment. A double blinded trial was conducted in 18 elderly patients who received either escitelopram or paroxentine for 12 weeks. Both showed improved performance on several tasks; however, their performance did not improve upon the training task. These results suggest that serotonine relapse inhibitors can reduce the neuronal response to reward. Serotonin has been used as an antidepressive agent since the early 1900s. However, it has been difficult to find out how effective these two agents are in treating major depression. This study compares the efficaciousness of both treatments in older patients suffering from major depression: sertraline 20mg/day or nortripityline 50mg per day. After nine months, stroke patients were treated with CBT. Although bipolar disorder is frequently associated with cognitive impairments, studies have suggested that CBT might be useful in improving mental function in patients with Major Depressive disorder. Bipolar disorder often leads to changes in behavior and mood. Cognitive remediations are widely used in adulthood because they involve repetitive exercises designed to improve functional skills. Brain scans indicate that there is a strong relationship between brain activity and emotion.

They conclude that lower household income, negative treatment attitudes, and greater age are independent predictors of attritions. The results further suggest that higher education, shorter duration of prior treatment, high anxiety sensitivity, and less agorative avoidance are also independently associated with an attrition. This suggests that future research may be needed to determine whether or not these characteristics are related to attrision. Pretreatment is important because it allows physicians to tailor their treatment to the patient's individual needs. Two studies were conducted on patients suffering from panic disorder: one using imipramine instead of placebo; another using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy plus exposure in a mixed-phobic group. A significant reduction in panic attack was found in both groups. However, neither group showed any improvement during the following 18 weeks. These results suggest that long-term behavioural treatments based on exposed nerves may be necessary for some patients but that they do not induce remission. Furthermore, there is little evidence that physician experience affects the outcome of medication therapy. For example, eight psychiatrists reported better response to methoxitone as a result of having more years of experience than other psychiatrists.

These results suggest that a lifestyle-integrated approach to balanced strength training may be more effective in preventing falls than traditional exercise. Two further studies are presented: one examines the effects of music-based exercise on physical function after an acute heart attack; another examines long-term weight loss when compared with other forms of weight loss.",0.9940109458472927

Types A and B services were cost-effective , although definition of cost-effectiveness varied between studies .
Fully coordinated , intensive models of care for secondary fracture prevention are more effective in improving patient outcomes than approaches involving alerts and /or education only","In this study, we examine the long-term Mortality Ratios of fractures in community-dweling women and men who have suffered a broken wrist between April 1989 to May 2007. Mortality is increased for all age groups for all fracture types except major fractures. Mortality follows a further fracture then declines but beyond five years still remains higher than in general population. A multi-faceted intervention designed to improve care among patients at risk of osteoporis was shown to increase the frequency of bone mineral Densitometris testing and filling an appropriate prescription for an Osteoprais medication. The absolute percentage of At-risk patients received Osteopsis management remains low. We investigate the mortality rate after hip fracture as well as other fractures; however, there are few published studies on absolute risk following initial fracture or subsequent fracture. Nurse case managers were found to be more effective when compared to a multifaced intervention that involved patient education, physician reminders, and BMD tests. This study also showed that nurse case managers could double ratesof Osterosis treatment within six months with a single intervention.",0.9664357122228575

They conclude that it reduces the risk of death and mortality for premature newborns with very low weight. Their results suggest that prophylactic use of bovine Lactoferrein will prevent late-onset Sepsis from occurring in preterm babies.

Conclusions This review suggests that interventions for T2DM , in primary care , are better targeted at individuals with very poor glycaemic control and that organisational interventions may be more effective","In this study, a patient population with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes receives web-based management for 12 months. The results indicate that the group receives greater reductions in blood pressure and glucose over 12 months than usual care or ""education and usual care""; however, there is no significant difference in other measures of control. A cluster-regular and ommized clinical trial has been performed to determine whether adding self-management tools to community primary medicine would reduce glicated hemogloin levels in type 2 patients. This study was conducted in Mexico where all patients had poor control of Type 2 disease. They were divided into three groups: 1) ProjectDulce -- only 2) Self-Help Intervention program for Type 2 Diabetes Management -- and 2) Medical Clinics -- which consisted of pharmacists, nurses, and physician assistants. All patients had uncontrolled Type 2 diseases at baseline. These patients were assigned to either one of three treatment groups: project Dulce/Peer health coaching, nurse-led education, or medical clinics. Results showed that HbA 1c reductions between baseline and Month 10 were much greater in the project-dulce group.

REVIEW ER 'S CONCLUSIONS Calcium supplementation alone has a small positive effect on bone density .
The data show a trend toward reduction in vertebral fractures , but it is unclear if calcium reduces the incidence of non vertebral fractures","In this study, we examine the effect of three different forms of bone loss: 1) a calcium-supplementation regimen; 2) a placebo-controlled regimen; and 3) a doubleblind, placebo-control regimen. The results suggest that older women can be more sensitive to increases in trace minerals than they are to changes in their bone mineral content. This suggests that younger women may be better protected from bone loss by increasing trace mineral intake. A two-year trial is performed on healthy older women who have been treated with either a percutaneous 17betrayal or a Caco-3-treated regimen. After two years, there is a significant decline in bone loss in all groups except for the control group. However, it does not seem to affect the rate of lost compact bone.

Airborne-particle abrasion and tribo-chemical silica coating are the pre-treatment methods with more evidence in the literature .
Increased adhesion could be expected after physico-chemical conditioning of zirconia .
Surface contamination has a negative effect on adhesion .
There is no evidence to support a universal adhesion protocol","This study focuses on the effect of various surface treatments on bonding strength to Zircon. The control group shows the lowest initial bond strength, but does not survive the age-induced aging treatment. All other surface treatments improve bond strength significantly, the group Si showing the highest initial values of 25.1 and 2.7mpa. However, only the ""grit-blasted"" method causes the crystalline phase change from T M to T x M. In this study, air-porned surfaces are better bonded to enamel than dentin. Adhesion is improved when both enamel and Dentin are etched, etched or blasted, primed with an M.D. cement. Bonding is performed in two-way analyzes of variance using Tukey's test. Alumina Air Abrasion promotes higher bond strength for three different types of cements: self-adehesive; resin cement; and YTtrium-Standard Zrconia Polycrystalline.

However , there is remarkably little research , particularly for individuals who do not have spinal-cord injury","In this paper, the authors describe a quasi-exactmental longitudinal design of a seven-week wheelchair training program to determine the effects on mechanical efficiency and strength in subjects with a spinal cord injury. They conclude that it is important to train at a high intensity to prevent fatigue during early recovery from the injury. A comparison between pre-and posttraining measurements was made for all subjects. The results suggest that this treatment program increases biomechanical economy by assuring no increase in shoulder or elbow joints stresses. This study also suggests that exercise at higher intensities may be more effective than conventional exercises because they can lead to greater physical capacity.

There is strong evidence to show that after hospital discharge , osteoporotic fracture patients are faced with higher morbidity , subsequent fractures , and mortality","In this study, we examine the long term mortality risk of a fracture following an initial fracture. We find that for all age groups, there is a significant increase in the risk of fatality after any subsequent fracture. Mortality follows a further fracture then declines but beyond five years still remains higher than in general population. Predicators of death after any fragilities fracture include age, quadricepans weakness, and later fracture but not ""comorbitible"" conditions. The rise in average Age of presentation with hip fracture is associated With a persistentally high mortality; 33 % and Morbidity, greater in those with an extra capsulear fracture. Costs are estimated from patients who have been treated by direct medical care, formal non-medical care, and informal treatment. A comparison between fractures to mortality results in a reduction in the cost of care among older people. An observational study investigates the effect of coordinated intervention on four-year refraction rate in patients with previous osteoporootic fractures. This study reduces the burden of injury by 80 %. It also shows that physicians can use chest-radiographs to detect fractures without undue suspicion. However, many patients do not receive proper treatment for their fractures because they are too young or old to be at risk for further fractures due to their low bone mineral density.

The results indicate that young men with good athletic skills suffer more than three time as many injuries as ""low risk"" subjects. This suggests that exercise-induced injuries may be true public health issues. A follow-up cohort study is performed in Finland to evaluate predictors between acute oroveruse injuries and various intrinsic risk factor. Four successive cohort studies of Finnish young conscripts were followed for six months. After injury rates were calculated, they showed that 27 % of male conscript had an acute injury while 51 % suffering from overuse injuries. Athletic fitness was not formally measured prior to entry into the service; therefore, it would help costbenefit studies on deferring or intervention. Women who fail the step test have a higher rate of stress fracture than those who do not fail. A step test can be used before military entry to identify women with increased injury risks. These factors are age, body mass, experience, ethnicity, playing position, and preseason fitness. They also suggest that improvements in aerobic running fitness might protect against injury in elite American football. Men's height, weight, body composition, flexibility, leg extension ability, jump height, peak O2, uptake, joint stability, and historyof previous injury are identified as the major risk factors for injured players. Female gender and low activity levels are associated with greater injury risk among female soldiers. Air Force basic military training is a highly active regiment during which recruits are assigned either motion control, stability, or cushionsed shoes according to plantar shape. There are no significant differences in injury risk across the group. For example, older age, slower 300m sprint time, slower 1.5 mile run time, lower total point on the physical Fitness test, lower selfrated physical activity, lower frequency Of aerobic exercise, a Prior upper or lowerlimb injury, and Prior foot or knee hurt that limited activity. Conclusive evidence supports these conclusions. Preseason fitness outcomes are important for predicting injury risk in light infantry training. Soldiers engaged in running, walking, orjogging spend most of their time indoors. However, there are some cases of lower-leg injuries such as ankle spraineds and shoulder injuries. Thus, physicians should use this knowledge to provide proper injury prevention counsel to their patients.",0.29657182136240806
25516002,Conclusions Current published evidence does not support survivorship differences among commonly used bearing surfaces in patients younger than age 65 years undergoing THA at short- to mid-term followup .,"In this paper, the first two studies of highly cross linked polyethylene are presented. The first is a mixed treatment comparison with conventionally cross-linked polyethylene in patients who undergo total hip replacement. The results show that highly crossed-linked Polyethylene wears less than conventionally air-and-highlycross-linkedpolyethylene at long term followup. A second study compares the wear of cementless and ceramic bearings in younger patients. This study determines whether the new technology can improve the long-term performance of total hiparthroplasty in young patients. It also investigates the incidence of audibly squeaching in association with wearing of metal bearings.",0.9969544635963948

The results suggest that it is possible to use statins as an anti-inflammatory or anti-oxalative agent in these patients. Aiming to further investigate the efficaciousness of short-lived statin therapy for patients with acute chest pain, we examine the effect of two different regimens: 1) atorvastapin; and 2) ezetamibe/simvastatine.

The first is a high quality protein diet that loses more weight than the second is an omnivorously low-quality meat diet. This results in reduced bone mineral dentition after weight loss for overweight post menopausalse women. The other two diets have no significant changes in bone mineral density. A further study shows that consumption of higher-quality animal proteins leads to less weight loss and improved body composition in patients with Polycysic Ovariary Syndrome. Two studies are performed: one compares a low fat, high-carburohydrate, or high-phosphorus diet to a conventionally high-protein/low-cholesteric diet; the other compares an energy- restricted, high carbohidrate, low-fibric diet to another type of highly refined food. These studies show that both diets lead to greater weight loss but do not differ significantly in regards to diet-remedient adverse events.",0.1169733677845428
21684488,There is evidence to support the role of specific exercise regimens in reducing impairments and improving upper limb function following specific upper limb fractures,"In a prospective study of 187 elderly patients, the results of early mobilisations are reported. The pain and stiffness of the fracture are not as severe in the elderly as those treated conventionally. Early mobilization does not lead to greater loss of reduced fractures; however, there is little improvement in the range of motion after 6 weeks. A comparison between two methods of Physiotherapy after fractured the proximal end of the Humerus is made. Twenty patients with uncomplicate fractures were assigned into two different groups: one group was treated by conventional short arm immobilization below the elbow plate of Paris cast while the other group received flexible casting application for the remaining two weeks which allowedfor early joint mobilizing. Functional recovery during this period was assessed by grip strength and joints mobility over the three-year period. No complications were noted in either group. There were few controlled trials examining non-operative treatment of distal circumferential fractures. To improve shoulder function, several patients were given early mobilization within three days following the fracture. These patients had better functional scores than their conventional treatment group. Although no complications were found in these patients, it seems that for ""no surgically treated patients"" only instructions are needed. This paper describes two studies designed to investigate the quality of control of trial outcome on physical therapist intervention. The first study used a self-reflection instrument to assess the reliability of measures obtained with the Physician's Evidence Data base. The second study uses a similar scale to measure the performance of physical therapy treatments. It shows that home exercises do not improve the outcome of fractures but have some additional benefits.",0.9459544584781552
28143406,"Conclusions Our meta- analysis indicates that vitamin C may prevent post-operative atrial fibrillation in some countries outside of the USA , and it may also shorten the duration of hospital stay and ICU stay of cardiac surgery patients .
Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that is safe and inexpensive .","In this study, Wuthering Heights demonstrates that the time course and concentrations of all three major antioxidants in 18 patients after coronary bypass surgery are not different from those in control subjects. He concludes that these two groups do not have any significant differences in their blood concentrations during or after the operation. However, his conclusion that vitamin C can reduce the risk of reactive oxygen-induced injury is supported by several other studies. The first study investigates whether ascorbicic acid can prevent atrial fillation after elective percutive coronary intervention. This study uses a double blind trial to determine whether ascotbic acid can reduce postoperative atrium fibrillation following elective cavalier surgery. Both groups show reduced length of stay and shorter hospitalization than the control group. A further study examines the effect of ascobic acid on atrial fibrilation in patients awaiting elective isolated uponpump coronarry surgery. It shows that ascorbic acid has a significant reduction in the duration of the ICU while maintaining a similar degree of improvement in the patient's health. Another study compares the effects of high dose ascorbite on the severity of acute atrial Fibrillation. These results suggest that an antioxidant agent may be useful in treating such patients.",0.8642164074015313

Evidence was inconclusive for foot function , walking speed , gait parameters , and reducing hallux abductovalgus angle progression .
CONCLUSION Custom orthoses may be beneficial in reducing pain and elevated forefoot plantar pressures in the rheumatoid foot and ankle .","In this paper, we describe the results of a double blinded clinical trial in which 135 patients were given custom-made foot orthoses while they were treated with placebo. The outcome was pain and disability for both groups. Shorter disease period predicted greater improvements on pain and ability than older age did. This study is important when trying to select patients who can benefit from foot orthos because it will help them to determine which patients are most likely to benefit. We also discuss the use of functional foot braces as an intervention for patients with recurrent rheusatoidic arthritis. A total of 13 patients were included in the present cohort. Pain and Disability were measured before or after the intervention phase using a numeric Rating Score for foot pain, the Foot function Index, the Western Ohio and McMaster's Universities OstegoarthritisIndex, and a 10 m walking test. All measures were selected by random analysis. Age was positively associated with changes in pain and injury at P &#8216p />0.05. These results suggest that shorter disease duration predict greater improvements inself-reported feet pain and disabledness.

Therefore , they may have added value in secondary prevention of CHD","The results of the Danrehab study suggest that a lifestyle-based approach to risk reduction is superior to conventional care in reducing the risk of myosclerotic atherosis. In this case, patients are assigned multiple risk factors over four years and reduced their risk significantly. This intervention reduces the rate of coronary narrowing by 47 % in men and women who have angiographicalally defined coronary disease. A multifactorial program for risk factor reduction has been proposed; however, it is not yet clear whether evidence remains valid from before 1995. The Danehab trial was designed as a center-ly rand and ommized clinical trial with a broad population of 5060 patients. It showed significant improvements in many risk factors, including lipoproteincholesterol, apolipatoprotein B, high density lipomeprotein cholesterol, body weight, exercise capacity, and consumption of  diet fat. After six years, there was significant improvement in several riskfactors, with little significant improvements for control group.

24985387,Conclusion : The TUG can be recommended for measuring basic mobility skills after stroke in patients who are able to walk .,"The aim of this study is to determine whether the speed of walking can predict the outcome of an acute stroke. It is a measure of gait speed that has been used for several studies. In this study, patients with severe gait problems after a stroke are compared with those who do not have any such problem. A comparison is made between the timed up and go test and the functional autonomy measurement system. The results indicate that there is significant change in the ability of these two measures to predict changes in people's health during the first five weeks after their stroke. This study supports the use of the 5mwt at a comfortably pace as the measure recommended by physicians and researchers who want to detect long-term change in walking condition.",0.08691928520414098

The results suggest that this may be due to the ""kallikreine-kinin"" system which regulates the secretion of aldostone in the body. A double blinded crossover trial was carriedout in 28 patients with mild or moderate essentialhypertension. Thirty were assigned to either placebo or fixed dose combination of torasemidie-PR or furoselume for 6 weeks. Both showed significant reductions in blood pressure after 4 weeks; however, they did not show any changes in other laboratory values. Two patients complained of transferent dizziness at the fixed dose treatment. No patient left prematurely from these studies because of side effects. Eighteen subjects whose clinicblood pressure remained over95 mmHhg despite captopriL 50mg twice daily plus feveremide 40mg once daily were ommed in acrossover study to four weekly treatments with either tablet or placebo. They had no significant differences in any measured parameter except for acute renal failure. There was only a slight change in mean bpm during the treatment period but no significant difference in pulse rate. These patients were well matched with no important differences at base in any measurements.

This study is designed to determine a greaterthan threefold increase on the risk of Major adverse events associated by aspirine resistance. Study 1: The purpose of this study was to determine whether aspirit resistance is associated long-term with adverse clinical events. Aspiron resistance is defined by platelets function testing and assumed that patients are unresponsive to it.

A prospective trial was conducted with 25 practices covering a populous city of Birmingham. All patients received warfarin From two Birmingham inner cities general practice ; in practice B were managed by DSS. In practice C were treated using DDS. Clinical outcomes, adverse events, and patient acceptanceability were recorded. Conclusions Computerized Dss enables the safely and effective transferof anticoagulationmanagement from hospital toprimary care and may improve patient outcome in relation to the level of controls. Frequency of review and General acceptability were measured. Two treatment strategies were tested: 1) Physicians completed a form after each visitor from apatient with hypertension during which they sent the forms to test centers for processing; 2) Physicians filled out the identical data collection forms again as test physicians did; and 3) Physicians used the same method of collecting blood pressures as test doctors but no patients received credit for their treatment. This resulted in greater diastolic blood pressure reductions than control practice's. For example, among patients with newly detected hypertension, test practice achieving a higher reduction in diatstolic press than control exercise.

There is some evidence that a prebiotic supplement added to infant feeds may prevent eczema .
It is unclear whether the use of prebiotic should be restricted to infants at high risk of allergy or may have an effect in low risk population s ; or whether it may have an effect on other allergic diseases including asthma","In this study, we examine the effects of whey prebiotics in infants and compare their stool composition to that of breastfed babies. The results suggest that the prebiotic mixture provides superior bowel comfort than control formulas. We conclude that enteral addition of prebiotic strains does not increase intestinal inflammation in early-infancy. This study is an attempt to determine whether enteral supplements of neutral or acidic OLIGOSACCHARDES can reduce infection morbidities by reducing gut inflammation. A combination of two different strains of probiotic was used for infants from birth until 6 months. Both groups produced soft and frequent stools during the initial three months of life. No differences are found in cry and sleep hours, number of parents-diagnoseed infections, antibiotic use, visits to general practitioners, and adverse reactions. Probiotics have no effect on growth and tolerance; however, they do not affect the amount of bacterial species in the newborns. Pregnancy has been associated with poor gut barrier function because it is difficult to obtain adequate nutrition in the first few weeks of life as well as reduced immune response. However, there is evidence that glutamine depleted enteral nutrition improves feeding tolerance, infectious morbity, and short term outcome in very-lowbirth-weight infants. These studies were performed in doubleblind blind trials. Infants received either a controlled formula or study formulations containing Boifid Obacterium longUM BL999, Lactobacilus rhumnosus L PR, Bifodobacterum animalis p.L., or Lacto Bacillus Paracasei ST 11. After six mo of life, these infants had fewer outbreaks of physician diagnoses, fever episodes, and pneumonia.

REVIEW ER 'S CONCLUSIONS Multifaceted professional interventions can enhance the performance of health professionals in managing patients with diabetes .
Organisational interventions that improve regular prompted recall and review of patients ( central computerised tracking systems or nurses who regularly contact the patient ) can also improve diabetes management .
The addition of patient-oriented interventions can lead to improved patient health outcomes .","The new system is safe and effective, and empowers our health care practitioners to provide improved blood glucose control. In this paper, we describe the results of an open study in which 204 patients received two sets of guidelines but provided data on the treatment of both conditions. A total of 733 patients aged 10-79 years were identified from the National Diabetes register. They were divided into three groups: 1) general practitioner care; 2) a system that shared between the General Physician and the Clinic; and 3) conventional practice care. After one year, there was no significant change in patient compliance with the guideline for managing Type 2 diabetes. Both groups showed improvement in self-reporting quality of life as well as improvements in their ability to follow the American Diabetes association's standards of care. Two studies examined the effects of problem-based education on improving the management of patients suffering from Type 2 disease. These studies included a pilot study of a ""centrally organized prompting"" for coordinating outpatient care among adult patients with poor gycemic control. This trial involved a group consisting of patients who had either poor or no Hbe1c test during the previous 12 months. It was found that these patients lost a considerable amount of body weight after receiving the intervention. However, they did not suffer any major changes in their health care habits. For example, patients who failed to show for planned visits or who failedto contact their physician when warning symptoms occurred poses important problems for primary care physicians. An eight-year-old patient with Type 1 diabetes was stratified by risks of hospitalization because of risk of complications such as hypoglyciaemics and ketoacemia. When treated according to the recommended regimen, the patients reduced their overall burden of illness and increased their satisfaction with treatment. As a result, the cost of care per patient fell significantly due to changes introduced in the prescription of hypoglocial agents. Thus, the use of decision supports systems based upon clinical practice guides could ultimately improve medical care.",0.11946812021973265

This review provides evidence that PRT is an effective intervention for improving physical functioning in  older people , including improving strength and the performance of some simple and complex activities .","This study focuses on balance ability, lower-earthquake muscle strength, fear of fall, and their relationship with older people. Ages 61 to 75 years are divided into three groups: power training; endurance training; and self-paced resistance training. The first group is composed of subjects who have been depressed for at least six months. The second group is comprised of those who have not yet had the experience of depression. A pilot study has been conducted to determine whether progressive resistance training can improve depressive symptoms in older patients. In this trial, thirty-six elderly patients were assigned either to a local progressive resistancetraining program or an advice control group. After six months, the patients showed significant reductions in depressive scores as well as improvement in vitality quality, sleep quality, and selfefficacy. Both groups improved significantly in terms of physical health, vitality, and depression. However, both groups did not show any change in perceived health. Two other studies examine the effect of exercise on nervebehavior in older people over age 75. These studies include a comparison of two types of exercise regimens -- resistance training and functional training -- that differ in intensity and duration. One was a controlled trial designed to assess the effects of vigorous resistance training on muscular strength and function in healthy old adults. It was found that heavy resistance training produced greater gains than moderate resistance training, but there was no difference in the effectiveness between the two groups. Another study investigates the efficaciousness of high intensity resistance training among older men with severe cognitive impairments.

Conclusions — There may be an obesity paradox in atrial fibrillation patients , particularly for all-cause and cardiovascular death outcomes .
An obesity paradox was also evident for stroke/systemic embolic event outcome in NOAC trials , with a treatment effect favoring NOACs over warfarin for both efficacy and safety that was significant only for normal weight patients","Warfarin is more effective in reducing the risk of heart attack than it does in preventing major bleeding. In patients who have atrial fibrilation, warfarin has a higher risk of stroke but is less likely to cause systemic embolilism. Edoxaran, a new antithrombin, is also more effective for preventing stroke and systemick embolism in patients with moderately to high-risk atrium fibrillation. Both regimens are associated with lower risks of major bleeding during their follow-up periods. A study on the association between body massindex, waist circumferential, relative weight gain, and levelof physical activity was performed in a large multi-centre trial of patients with attic fibrillations.

The results of the exercise program are described in this paper, and it is suggested that strength training may be an important part of the rehabilitation of elderly women with chest pain. It is also shown that physical training can improve quality of life as well as reduce the risk of falling. A clustered randomized control trial was conducted to determine whether combined high-level balance and moderate intensity progressive resistance training could reduce the rate of fall in residents of long term aged care. In this study, 48 frail patients were assigned to one of three intervention groups: high intensity, low intensity, or control group. They were evaluated for muscle strength, gait, balance,quality of life, and body mass. Both groups showed significant improvements in their performance on the Short Performance Battery, Quality of Life, and Body Composition. However, they did not show any change in functional status. These results suggest that routine multicomponent exercises should be considered for older adults because overall physical outcome are improved. Two different types of weight-based exercise regimens were used to evaluate the effects of these regimens on falls in older adults. Strength training was more effective than power training but was more efficacious. Back pain and health related quality of living were studied in older community dwellers with low bone masses. All three kinds of group-base exercise programs significantly relieved back pain and injuries, but only resist and agility training greatly improved health-regarding quality of live in older people with low bones mass.",0.05561758526745932

Propafenone and IV amiodarone may be relatively less efficacious .","In this study, we compare the safety of aviodarone with procainamia in patients who have failed to restore their atrial rhythm. Both drugs are effective in improving the patient's condition but side-effects are sparse. Aims 1: The aim of these studies is to compare the effectiveness and safeness of amiostinone and quinicidine for conversion of paroxismal atrium fibrillation. We examine the efficability and safety of both drugs in terms of reducing the rate of ventricular ratecontrol and proportion of restored to sinus rythme at six h after initial treatment. Conclusions Although both drugs reveal the same efficacy, the conversion into sinus rhythm inthe group treated withpropafenon was observed more rapidly despite the long paroxysal atrial fibrilation. Study 1: An introduction emergency department cardioversion and discharge of newly onset atary fibrillations has been shown as a safe strategy; however, there is still debate about whether or not such an aggressive approach should be used. This study consists of two double blinded placebo-controlled trials designed to determine whether flecainides can be as effective as either drug in treating recent-onset acute atrial fibrillation. These studies were conducted in three different groups: 1) patients with paruxsmal arrhythmiatis that did not convert within 24 hours; 2) patients with heart failure; and 3) patients with rate control than those with ritm control. They found no significant differences in time to conversion between the four groups. Propensity Score-ad adjusted OR of aff progression in patients without rate control was greater than that of rate control in patients with rates rather than rhythm controls. Adverse events were more common among the higher-dosed groups.

31885541,Conclusion The systematic review and meta- analysis support that probiotics are superior to placebo in NAFLD patients and could be utilized as a common complementary therapeutic approach,"The effects of pro-biotics on the gastrointestinal system in patients with no alcohol disease are reported. In this study, a group of 66 healthy subjects receives Bifdobacterum longum and lifestyle modification for 12 weeks.

Probiotics also improve liver function by reducing levels of ALT, bilerubin, albumin, total cholesterol, high-degradation lipoprotein, LDL,cholesterol, trigglycerides, fasting plate glucose, insulin, C-Reactive Protein, tumor necroseis factor, and serumendotoxins. This study is an attempt to determine whether probiotic or prebiotics can be used as a treatment for patients with non-alcoholic fat liver disease.

No consistent evidence was found for other psychological variables .
CONCLUSIONS It is impossible to define a generic set of predictors of outcome of multidisciplinary rehabilitation and back schools for patients with chronic low back pain because the review ed studies were descriptive or exploratory in nature , and most predictors were only studied once .
Nevertheless , for several predictors , consistent evidence was found .","In this study, we examine the effects of compensation involvement on patients with chronic back pain. We find that patients in the compensation group have greater pain and less disability than those in the control group; however, they do not report any changes in pain or disability at three and twelve months after treatment. This suggests that there may be a relationship between compensation involvement and patient satisfaction before and after intervention. A prospective cohort study is conducted to investigate whether expert judgment can be used as a reliable basis for making informed decisions about the need for treatment in patients with low back pain who are not yet fully recovered from their injury. The results indicate that no agreement is found between physicians' ratings of patients needs and ability to improve their health. Furthermore, the most consistently predictor of patients' status at the six month follow-up evaluation was the patients' own belief in ""the existence ofeffective treatments"" and their perceived abilities for learning to manage the condition.",0.17514719768137613

Currently , few studies have explored using walking cadence prescription as an intervention to increase physical activity levels .
Conclusion .
Prescribing walking cadence as a way to increase physical activity levels has potential as a practical and useful strategy , but more evidence is required to assess its ability to increase physical activity levels at moderate intensity","This paper focuses on the use of a walking-pace device to improve blood pressure in low-active postmenopalusal women. It uses a three-arm, blinded trial to compare the effect of two community-pedometer-guided walking regimens relative to 'control group' on blood pressure among sedentarian/low active Postmenopulous women. The study is based on a random sample of 120 females who are assigned one of three groups: A) 10,000 steps daily; B) 10,500 steps per day; and C) 20,50 steps per minute in moderate intensity.

Some possibly clinical ly meaningful differences between paroxetine and other ADs exist , but no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these findings .
In terms of early response to treatment ( one to four weeks ) there was moderate quality of evidence that mirtazapine was better than paroxetine and that paroxetine was better than reboxetine .

The results suggest that depression is associated with improved declarative memory; however, it is not entirely clear whether these patients will respond to either drug. A second study investigates whether the association among funding and conclusions from trials reflects effects or adverse outcomes. This study was designed to identify early changes in behavior that occurred during the first two weeks of treatment by comparing the severity of each patient's disorder to the severity after eight weeks of therapy. Both groups showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms. Mirtzapine appears to produce earlier improvements in anxiety symptoms when compared against imipramine. Paroxeten seems to have greater efficacy in treating major depression than paroixetine. Paroxentine has a possible sooner antidepressan effect than imiprimine, and demonstrates better tolerated antidempressant effects on anxiety symptoms.

In addition, it is found that after bariatic surgery, a change in acrotinemia is associated with waist circumference as well as carbohydrate consumption. Adipostinemia increases in obese women who lose more than their body weight; however, they are also influenced by other factors, such as increased levels of TNF-'s serum concentrations.

20149117,"The authors even suggested in this case increasing educational levels as a means of reducing obesity .
Indeed , we have recently reported results from two experimental studies showing that mental work up-regulates appetite-stimulating hormones and promotes overconsumption of food ( 3,4 ) .
Furthermore , a careful examination of our data revealed that when the subjects were categorized on the basis of the mental workload intensity , those for whom the intensity of the mental effort was greater significantly increased their spontaneous food intake as compared with those characterized by a less strenuous cognitive effort .
In other words , the harder we think the more we eat .
This hyperphagic effect of intense thinking was also accompanied by more plasma glucose instabilities ( 5 ) .
The fluctuations in plasma glucose levels that were observed are in agreement with the literature showing that a period of intense cognitive processing leads to a measurable decrease in levels of blood glucose ( 6 ) , a fall that has also been associated with feeling less energetic ( 7 ) .
Accordingly , food intake might be perceived as a strategy for allowing the individual to recover optimal body functioning .
These observations are also relevant for students having hard times to learn at school and for whom study ing is arduous and mentally challenging .
On the basis of our observations , we find it realistic to postulate that those susceptible to commit more cognitive effort to take in charge st and ard mental tasks are more likely to over-eat and gain weight compared with those for whom the accomplishment of mental tasks at the same level of performance is elementary or more natural .
Along the same lines , it would not be surprising to find a higher dropout rate for those ‘ mentally stressed ’ students .
In a system where academic performance continues to rank as high priority in public schools , it seems obvious that some students are genetically more gifted and likely to perform at a higher level ( 8) .
As previously shown , better cognitive abilities are predictive of more important life achievements such as earning a doctorate , securing a patent , or publishing a novel or major literary work ( 9 ) .
It may be somewhat paradoxical that the amount of knowledge-based work is more important in the higher socioeconomic groups whereas population data show a higher prevalence of obesity for the socioeconomically disadvantaged .
Thus , individuals highly involved in mental work are not all likely to over-eat and other healthy behaviours such as regular physical activity may counterbalance the net impact on energy balance .
As mentioned in the paper by Yu and co-workers ( 1 ) , educational attainment seems to be an important mediator of this relationship .","The narrator discusses three different studies that examine the influence of a glyceine-containing substance on mood.

The efficaciency of internal and external shocks are greater than those of transtoric electrical cardioversion; however, there are some drawbacks: body weight is associated with conversion to sinus pattern. Acute fibrillation cannot always be converted into sinus rhythm by either type of cardioversion. Transthoracic electric cardioversion is preferred because it reduces heart rate but does not induce relapse or death. Clonidine is more effective in slowing ventricular rate for patients with rapidly atrial fibrilation. This study compares the effects of digoxiin with low-diltyazem on exercise-induced fever.

It changes the drug disposition, which can lead to changes in blood concentration and time after surgery. In this paper, we examine the effects of gastric bypass on the absorbance of atorvarstatin acid as well as its effect on body mass index. A previous study showed an increase in systemic absorption of ATORVASTINA in patients who undergo either gastric bypass or Duodenal Switch. The results suggest that patients should be closely watched for both adverse events and therapeutic effects during the first year after these procedures. These studies are divided into three parts: 1) AIMS; 2) Physician's Notes; and 3) Pre-Bariatric Surgery. First, we discuss the use of anti-receptor drugs at the usual dosages but with greater doses than conventionally prescribed. Second, we investigate the effect of posture on gastricemptying. Posture has been shown to affect gastric emptyation. Third, we describe the role of Cyp1A4, P-glp substrates, and their interaction with ranitidine. Finally, we present a new approach to studying drug-drugs interactions in vexed vivo. This involves using several cytomorphine-P450 isotypes to assess drug-damage interactions in animal vivomembry. Next, we compare the pharmacollagenity of midasolam and digixin in obese patients before biatric surgery. After two years, the weight loss and improvement in body composition are similar to those of control subjects. Furthermore, there is no difference in the rate of absorption between the two groups.

The results indicate that there is no significant difference at baseline between the fortfied group and the unfrotified group in iron status, serum retinol, and growth. Children with anemia are significantly more likely to be anemic than those with low levels of zinc or iron. This suggests that both types of intervention may have beneficial effects on growth. A South African trial investigates the effect of weekly and day-long supplementation on children's growth. Both groups improve their height and weight; however, neither intervention affects growth as well as morbidity. Pregnancy outcome and maternal Fe status are also improved by either type of supplementation. Two studies assess the efficiacy of daily and weekly multivitamin/multimineral regimens in improving infant health. One study uses a doubleblind, placebo-control trial to determine whether two different doses of single micronutrientes can improve infant development.

One study investigated the effect of using Lactobacilus gg as an anti-rotavirus treatment in children under 2 years old. Both regimens reduced the duration of disarrhea by decreasing the frequency of vomitus and fever. Another study examined the effects of Lacticillin gg on the reduction of length of diarrhea in patients with mild chronic malnutrition. It was found that it did not improve the recovery of patients after they had been treated with other probiotic agents.",0.5251621359914063

The results suggest that short-term pulmonary rehabilitation can improve exercise capacity in patients with ""cold obstrutive pulmonary disease"" who are not at risk for complications after a resect. A prospective observational study is designed to assess the impact of short term preopera pulmonary rehab on exercise capacity among patients with chronic Obstructive Plunge Disease. In this paper, we examine the effect of short-lived preoperative physiotherapy on postoperative complications following lung surgery.

A total of 13 European countries contribute their results from consecutive patients who have successfully resynchronized with a transvenous Biventricular-VVIR pacemaker between November 2008 to June 2009. This study provides important information about current European practices with regard to population, selection criteria, procedural regimens, and status after discharge. These studies should be useful as benchmarking individualpatient patient management andnational practice against wider experiencedStudy1:OBJECTiveS The main purpose of this study is to assess  whether the benefits of Bivent pacing were maintained over 12 months. In patients with heart failing, either atrial or sinus rhythm, it was found that BiV paced improved both quality of life and morbidity over a follow up period. Over a twelve month follow-up interval, no differences emerge between patients in either group. Both groups show significant and sustained improvement of all assessment parameters; model p 0.001, for all parameters. Concluusions Heart failure patients without ventricular conduction and permanent aff treated with Cr showed large and sustain long-term improvements of left ventric function and functionalcapability, similar to those in SR only if ablation was done.

He uses a four part search strategy to identify studies that have either positive or negative effects on knowledge, self-efficiacacy, or behavior change. The results of these studies suggest that IHCA may be useful for improving patients' health but that it does not work as effectively as other forms of intervention. Anderson concludes by comparing the effectiveness of two different types of exercise regimens in patients with chronic disease: an individualized training program using an activity tracker and a vigorous physical activity program. Both groups show improved health status at 24 months after the initial trial. However, there are no significant differences between the treatment groups regarding functional ability nor quality of life. This study is important because it will help surgeons better understand how to interpret patient care when they need to make informed decisions.",0.09561446686076552

We conclude that although some patients may suffer from long lasting neck pain, MRI results cannot explain the symptoms. This study suggests that, although some wounds are more likely for long-lasting Neck pain, there is no significant relationship between neck pain severity and progression in either group. Study 1: The purpose of this study is to determine the lifetime, period, and point predominance of neck pain among Saskatchewan adults; it is not possible to accurately predict the prevalence of these pains in the North American population. A case control study of neck injury was conducted in nine states across the U.S. to assess the frequency and severity of neck discomfort. Forty five per cent of individuals with neck hurt were originally injured by a motor accident. Neck pain has been poorly studied in Canada. Although neck pain seems to be a common cause of disability, few studies have examined its incidence or course in the general populace.

They assess the effects of an intervention on young women in eight rural South African villages by using village-level summary summaries. The results indicate that the intervention has significant positive effects on raising knowledge of acute respiratory infections in children. Women are more likely to access voluntary counseling and tests after two years of follow up than they were before. This suggests that maternal knowledge may be useful for reducing intimate partner violence among women in poor countries. A cluster-rand-omized study is conducted in Bauchi state, Nigeria, to determine whether an early breast-induction and exclusive breast-breasing intervention can improve mothers' health. It was found that only delayed introduction of water led to increases in exclusive breast feeding among women receiving the intervention. However, there was no increase in malaria or anemia prevalence in both groups. These studies suggest that community-based participation could significantly reduce newborn mortality in poor rural populations.

The prescription of vegetarian diets  reduces mean body weight , suggesting potential value for prevention and management of weight-related conditions","In this study, we examine the effects of energy density on energy consumption in both leans and obese women. We find that energy denies any influence on energy intake by weight but rather influences short-term energy consumption. The results suggest that cueries related to food consumed have greater influence on long-term eating than does the amounts of energy consumed. A vegetarian diet can lead to numerous benefits including weight loss. Several studies have examined the jointeffects of personal preference for a caltoovovenegetarian diet or a high-fat, low- fat omnivorously diet on changes in body size, total cholesterol, ratio of lipoprotein to high-denshing lipoproprotein, triacyllglycers, insulin resistance, and Macnutrient Intake during an 18 mo study. This study was a randomised trial of 174 overweight and obese adult subjects who were assigned first to one of 2 preference condition: yes or no. If they were initially assigned to either of the two diet conditions, they were then assigned to their preferred diet. All outcome measures were measured at baseline and after four weeks. After these three treatments, LDL cholesterol concentrations declined by 8.5x/-1.9 percent, 33%+/-1.8 % ; and 29.1x/-3.0mmol/dl within the control group.

Most evidence of benefit pertains to a primary prevention population using a thiazide as first-line treatment","The effect of blood pressure reduction on stroke is not yet clear, but the results suggest that the apparent effects on blood pressure may not be the only cause for stroke risk reduction. In this study, a double blinded placebo-control trial was conducted to determine whether an antihytensive regimen would reduce the risk in patients with isolated hypertension. A total of 48 patients were assigned to receive 12.5mg/d of Chlorthalidon and either 25mg or 0.05mg of Reserpino. Strokery incidence significantly reduced in participants attainting study specific stystoic blood pressure goals. This result supports the notion that early treatment of angiothrosin-converting enzyme inhibitors does not improve clinical outcome until after coronary bypass surgery. Although the benefits are well established, the value from treatment in older people is less clear. Swedish Trial in old patients with hyper tension: STOP-HIPERATION; a prospective, double-blind, omished, doubleblind frank trial was performed to compare the efficaciousness of active antiHypertensesive therapy on the frequencyof fatal and non Fatal stroke and Myocardial Ion and Other Cardio Death in elderly patients who had isolated high blood pressure.

Obesity may contribute to early onset of puberty in girls , while in boys , there is insufficient data .","In this study, we assess the association between birth weight and early age atmenarche in a prospective cohort of 1134 women. The results indicate that faster post-birth weight gains are associated with an earlier age at Menarche than those obtained by stable growth. Girls who experience rapid growth in early childhood have an average age for menarchia that is 4.6 months older than girls based on their growth was stable. We conclude that both body mass index and height in early life predict the timing of puberstal onset. This will help to identify children susceptible to early puberties. A population-based cohort of 13,301 women from Australia were followed prospectively from fetal life 18 wK of pregnancy to apoxation 12 - 14, yr. At menarche, growth status at birthwas judged by anticipated birth weight ratio; a proportion of observed infant's birth weigh over median birth bearing appropriate for maternalage, weight / height,parity, child sex, and gestationsal age. Postnatal gain was judged as measured by body mass Index. Both height and body Mass Index in early years predicted the trajectoryof pubertal develination. Women with higher body massindices during childhood had a lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes than women with lower body massindex or greater waist circumference. These findings suggest that earlier age may also be associated with increased risk of type 2 disease.",0.9941097083988295

This is due to the fact that they are more susceptible to disease at lower levels of D than other children. The results suggest that daily doses of high-dose vitamin D may be effective in reducing the risk of severe pneumonia among Mongolian infants. A double-blind, placebo-control trial compares the efficacy of 1,000 IU of Vitamin D1 with placebo in patients aged 1 to 11 months in Afghanistan.

Consumption increases energy consumption and amount of carbohydrates over the trial; however, the consumption of Protein and Fibre increased and fatty ingestionremained unchanged. Both groups show reductions in body massindex, waist circumference, fastingblood glucose, and C reactiveprotein. This suggests that it appears that eating a diet full of hydrogenated fat seems to reduce abdominal obesity.

In this study, we examine the association between scaropenia -- a disease-causing disorder caused by a loss of muscle mass -- and postoperative morbidity in adult patients undergoing gastric cancer treatment. This paper describes a large-scale observational study using preoperative abdominal scans to determine the prevalence of these diseases. Sarcopenia is one of the most common risk factors for severe postopcy after radical Gastric Cancer surgery.

In overweight men, consumption of both types of oils results in greater losses of body weight than that of LCTs. Consumption also leads to greater reductions in body mass index, waist circumference, bodyfat, and subcutive fat. Both groups show significant decreases as they age; however, their serum concentrations do not differ between them.

The results indicate that both types of cements have a higher failure rate than conventional bonding agents. This is due to the fact that they do not require curing of the enamel before bonding. However, there are some differences in the shear strength and debonding time of the two different materials. A glass-impressed cement has a lower failure rate when bonded directly onto dry teeth but does not cause any damage to an enamel surface.

We compare two different methods of needle-snacking: the Bergström method and the Myosin Heavy Chain technique. The subjects report no pain nor much less with either technique but both have excellent agreement for their respective activity levels. This study shows that the new technique is more comfortable than the Bergstrom technique. Muscle dysfunction has been a major issue in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly after an exacerbitation. To determine whether nerve stimulators can be used to counteract muscle dysfunction, we performed a pilot study on 15 patients following a sudden acute exorbation. After six weeks, the quadricepals force improved significantly only in the Neuromuscular Electrostimulation group. A comparison of nine Caucasian and eight African 10-km runners showed significant differences in maximal O2, consumption, peak treadmill velocity, fatigue resistance, time to fatigue, and type I fiber proportion.

The results indicate that physical and mental health are worse than they were before. Among these predictors, depression and smoking are significant. Age-specific persistence is associated with lower survival probabilities but it is not associated with overall survival outcomes in older patients. This suggests that age-specific studies may be inadequate to determine whether there is a difference in outcome between young and elderly patients. Two studies relate the use of a validated measure of frailness as an indication of mortality or need for admission into an institution. First, we describe a prospective cohort of patients who have been treated for head and neck malignancies. We assess the association between post-treatment health-regarded life scores and survival among newly diagnosed head/neck malignancy patients. These include: pre-operative depressive measures; functional well-behaved status; and head and Neck Cancer-specific score. Pre-operating comprehensive gyeriatric assessment was performed on all new adult patients undergoing elective surgery from May 13 to January 14, 2014. All patients were divided into three groups: fit, intermediate, and frail. They had significantly reduced their pre-operational depressive symptoms. Second, we examined the relationship between prognostics of disease and survival in patients with advanced stage head's and neck tumors. Prognostic features included age, gender, race, and consumption of alcohol and tobacco. Third, we investigated the effect of breast and prostatecancer on health- related quality of living.

A Swedish trial in Old Patients With Hypertension was designed to compare the benefits of active Antihypertinesive therapy against placebo on the frequent death from heart attack and other major cardiovascular events in older patients. Although the benefits were discernible at age 84, they were discernibly up to age 70 years. Both lifestyle changes were associated with reduced blood pressure and body weight. Diuretics were recommended as first line agents for the treating of hypertension; however, there has been little evidence regarding their efficacy in elderly patients. The European Working party on High Blood pressure in the Elderily study was a prospective open-ended trial conducted in 10 European countries where 1283 patients aged 80 years old were assigned either an ACE blocker or diuretic regimen.

The results suggest that vitamin A may reduce the risk for sub-critical hypothyroidiism in pregnant women. Two studies have been conducted in Lithuania to determine whether or not iron and iron deficiencies could be reduced by co-forting salt with iron as ""micronized ground Ferric Pyophosphate"" or ""iron as encapped ferrous fumamine."" These studies indicate that children from urban schools have a lower Uic concentration than children from other areas. Children from rural schools have an increased Urinary IoDine concentration; however, both groups show improved efficacy in reducing goiter levels. Both DFS's were effective in preventing excessive iron consumption in schoolchildren. Goiter is particularly common among children with irondeficiency. Iron deficient children consume iodicized salt either as micronised ground ferricpyrophosphoe or as entcapsulated ferrously fumarate. This study shows that iron supplementation improvers their response to iron treatment. Anemia is common in India but iron deficition can also reduce the efficacity of ion prophylaxes.

The meta- analysis provides little evidence for the surgical principle that using less invasive techniques , introducing less foreign bodies or causing less ischaemia reduces the extent and severity of adhesions","Laparoscopic needle-yag photocoagulation is performed in 40 women with sclerotic ovaries. After this procedure, the subjects are assigned to either have laparoscopic or expectant care. The patients are then divided into 2 groups: first, they undergo elective and urgent surgery; second, they receive second-look sutures. In these two groups, there is no significant difference between pain scores, wound complications, or pregnancy rates. A single-layer closed abdominal wall is faster, less costly, and theoreticallly safer than  Layered Closure, and it should be recommended that separate Suture of the Peritoneum be Ab and Oned. This study describes an attempt to determine whether sutureing the peritoleum as part of a separate surgical step in the closing of midline abdominal surgical wounds is necessary. Two groups of patients were selected for this trial: group 1, underwent ""visceral pplication"" while in group 2, the viscerally peritoneus was not closed. At repeat Cesarean delivery, four specimens from initial scar were collected by light microscope and scanning electron microscopic analysis. There was neither significant difference in pain scores nor wound complications among the two groups. Conclusions Closure ofthe visceral pertineum at cesaren delivery might produce an  inflammation reaction and adheresions, evidenced by reacting and regenerating mesoteshelial hyperphospholusa and submesothielal fibroses. These studies suggest that laparography may be able to reduce the chances of postoperative attachment formation. Adhections are reported among patients with open or closed peritonsic repair. They are further studied in terms of long-term follow-up. Adhersions are found in 7 % of cases with closed or unclosure methods. No differences in duration, change in bloodglobin level, time to mobilized and oral intake, and post-operation hospital stay were noted. Adhissions were also found in 7, 3% of cases without tubal sucturing. Esther concludes that she does not need to close the abdomen with suture material.

The frequency at which panic attacks are reduced relative to placebo is significantly increased in the escorts. Venlafine extended release has significant efficacy on the Panick Disorder Severness Score; however, it is not as effective for short term treatment of panic disease. A parallel-group trial compares gabapanentin with paronoxetine in treating panic attack. Both drugs improve the severity of symptoms but do not lead to any changes in sexual dysfunction or weight gain. Although no differences were found between the two groups in terms of anxiety or depression, they suggest that serotoniners and noradranergic agents may have different effects on panic disorder.

: As well as antibiotic prophylaxis being a generally effective intervention for preventing postoperative wound infection , the level of this effectiveness would appear to be reasonably independent of what type of surgery is being considered .
In particular , perhaps a sensible philosophy would be to assume that antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in reducing the risk of wound infection for all types of surgery , even ones where no clinical trial data exists and make exceptions to this rule if , for certain types of surgery , it can be proved to the contrary","In this paper, we report the results of a prospective, doubleblind, and placebo-controlled trial of ceftraxone in the treatment of open fractures. It was found that ceftriaxone reduced the rate of wound infection by about 3% vs. 2% in the placebo group.

The results are very good after six months. We conclude that minimally-incisiond total hiparthroplasty does not compromise long-term patient outcome. However, it is important to note that there are some drawbacks to this approach because it requires greater experience with less invasive techniques. This study also compares the outcomes of three different approaches: 1) a short, single-inccision approach; 2) a traditional transglutial approach; and 3) a miniaturely-indicated approach.

This systematic review identified and grade d the evidence for a range of population -based strategies to promote lifestyle change .","Early Stopping is a work-site intervention designed to prevent overweight and obesity among children in the early years of life. The results suggest that proximity to food stores may influence pregnancy quality. In addition, women living greater than four miles away from a grocery store are twice as likely to fall into the lowest diet compared to those living within two miles of another grocery store. This suggests that there may be a relationship between proximity of food stores and diet quality for pregnant women. Pregnancy studies include: 1) A worksite health improvement program; 2) A study of an early childhood obesity reduction program; and 3) A study on the effect of smoking bans at worksites on employees' health.

One investigates the association between tobacco polices and students' perception of peers who smoke; the other examines the effect by advertising on purchases of lower-fat snacks. Although some studies have suggested that labeling foods will help people to make informed choices, few studies have examined how these changes in perceived healthiness affect food choice. Three studies examine whether girls can achieve moderate physical activity through a walking bus program; one examines indoor smoking regulation in public buildings; and the third examines financial incentives for quitting smoking.

While it is prudent to consume added sugars in moderation , the reduction of these components of the diet without other reductions of caloric sources seems unlikely to achieve any meaningful benefit","In this study, we examine the effect of a moderate-florose diet on blood sensitivity and lipoproteins. The subjects consumed four sweetened beverages for three weeks each: medium fructomese at 40 gram/day, high glucose at HG ; and high sucare -- high-sulrose -- each at 80g/day. Hepatic suppressing of glucose production was significantly lower during the clamp than after the other two interventions. Consumption is not associated with increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. This study furthermore investigates the association between egg consumption and total cholesterol. We examined the relation of egg consumption as well as food sources to cause-specific mortality in a prospective cohort of 35987 older Iowa women free of Type 1 diabetes. After control for body massindex, fat, fiber, and sugar, we observed strong inverse relationships with incidence of disease after adjustment for possible non-dietary confounded variables. These results confirm that grain, wholegrain, total phosphorus, and carbohydrates are protective against Type 2 disease. Furthermore, milk and diet cocaxine reduce blood pressure by 15 - 20 % versus regular cola.

Athletics are associated with high performance among boys and girls while physical education is associated with higher fitness among girls. This study also examines the association between physical activity levels and weight status in rural children. Children from selected schools were included in this study. They were divided into three groups: 1) overweight or obese children; 2) moderately active children; and 3) non-obese children. Both groups spent more time engaged in moderate-and vigorous activities. However, both groups failed to meet their fitness standards during the second half of the sample period. Although there was an increase in physical activity across the sample, it was evident that obesity was not related to any changes in body mass or exercise. Thus, future intervention should focus on improving physical activity especially of moderate intensity and increasing physical fitness so that they can reduce obesity and prevent future chronic diseases.",0.16033787878530698

The results indicate that all of these treatments help reduce self-reported panic attacks over a year's follow-up interval. Acrophobia is treated by two sessions of physical therapy using an ""electrified glass elevator"" to which subjects receive only one dose of placebo or DCS. This leads to significant improvements in anxiety and skin conductance changes during the virtual environment.

The results indicate that a multifactor reduction of these factors will significantly reduce the severity of disease in men and women who have been assigned to normal care or ""risk reduction."" This intervention is more successful than usual care because it improves several risk factors including lipoprotein, cholesterol, exercise capacity, and body weight. Although patients receive better health after their first visit, they do not experience any changes in anxiety or depression. A second study examines whether nurse-run preventive care delivered by nurses can improve secondary prevention for patients with heart disease. This trial compares regular postdischarity care with home-based treatment; there is no significant difference in readmissions during the first year of follow up.

Conclusions Our review highlights the lack of evidence and the diversity among trials , while supporting the potential of social capital interventions to reach comprehensive health effects in older adults","The Experience Corps is a program that places older adults in public schools to improve their health and social well-being. In this trial, the volunteers increase physical activity, strength, people one can turn to for assistance, and psychological well being. Older people are less depressed when they receive support from professional leaders than control group nurses. This study examines the effects of group nursing on older people's feelings about loneliness, social activity, and mental well-behaving. It concludes that elderly people have lower depression than those who receive usual care. However, it does not reveal any differences between loneliness or social connections between the two groups. Aim This paper is an attempt to critically review literature on the relationship between social capital as well as health across countries. There are no studies that show a significant effect of individual level social capital but there are some that indicate a greater difference between area and individual levels.

The first is the use of chest tubes and the second is the technique of using an air leak to treat the disease. They conclude that it should be the most cost-effective treatment for the disease because it reduces the need for analgesia and decreases the time spent in the hospital. This study compares the cost of either surgery or stenting in patients with multiplevessel disease. Both methods have improved their short-term outcomes. However, they are associated with greater need for repeat blood vessel re Vasculation.

However, they did not show any significant differences in physical performance between those who became ""vitamin D sufficient"" and those who didn't. This study was designed to determine whether higher doses of Vitamin D would improve lower extremity functions as well as reduce falls. It was found that among these treatment groups, only 60,000 iu/day could achieve 25-hydroxyvindomin D levels at least 30ng/mol/L; however, over the 12 months follow-up, the risk increased significantly among the treatments. Although higher monthly dosages of vitamin C were effective in improving upper extremity function, they had little benefit on lower legity function. A double- blinded, randomed, placebo-control trial was conducted with 57 professional Rugby Union players in Newzeal and compared them with a placebo group. They received 50,000 ius/week of cholesciferol from June 3, 2003 to June 5, 2005 and were followed for three to five years. After two years, fractures were reported in each group. There was an increase in the relative size and number of type II muscles in the control group but no significant changes in muscle strength or endurance in the other group",0.4775076853661823
32383066,"In the present meta- analysis , reductions in the risk of hip fracture  with milk consumption were only observed among American adults , but not among Sc and inavian adults , possibly because milk products are more commonly fortified with vitamin D in the former population than in Sc and inavian countries .
The reduction in the risk of hip fracture was also observed with yogurt consumption , which is often associated with healthy lifestyles and dietary patterns that contribute to improved bone health .
Fueling this uncertainty , the elevated  risk of hip fracture  in association with  milk consumption was observed in a cohort of Swedish women .
The cumulative evidence from prospect i ve cohort studies reassuringly suggests that the risk of hip fracture may not be elevated among people who consume milk , yogurt , and cheese , and that a greater consumption of milk or yogurt may even be associated with a lower risk of hip fracture depending on the factors that may differ across the population of interest","In this study, we examine the association between a high mineral load and hip fracture risk in women with low or high levels of dairy consumption. We find no significant association between these two groups but that there is an inverse relationship between calcium intake and bone mineral density among men with higher amounts of dietarycalcium. This study furthermore investigates the effect of endogenous ""sex steroids"" on bone health by comparing the effects of one type of sex-steel to another. The results suggest that endogenously-sex stewards may be associated with lower risks of fracture in older women. Short trials of caiusculose have shown that it reduce loss of bone mineral Density in postmenophausal women; longer observationals do not usually find a reduced risk of hipfracture with higher-calium diets. A few more studies have examined the effect upon calcium absorption as a result of genetic factors, including specific vitamins D receptor genepolmorphism. These studies are followed for several years before they are published. They assess whether milk, yogurt, cheese, cream, fluid dairy, and milk plus yogurt + cheese increase Bone Mineral Densibility in healthy postmenomepausal females. Women receive either a low protein or high-potent renal acid load of 500 millig/d per day. After six weeks, blood and urine samples are collected. There is no clear association Between Calcium Consumption and Bone Mass Index after adjustment for potential confounders.

There is no clear dose – response relationship and there is no association between PPI therapy and risk of fracture in those at highest risk .
Finally , there is no clear mechanism through which PPI therapy increases the risk of fracture , as recent r and omized trials show no impact of PPI therapy on calcium absorption and there is no association between PPI therapy and risk of osteoporosis .
We therefore feel there is insufficient evidence to change PPI prescribing habits based on risk of fracture .
There is no evidence to support prescription of calcium and /or vitamin D in patients simply because they are taking PPI therapy .","Proton Pump Inhibitors increase Osteophosis fracture risk via hypocholichydria, and consequent reduction of fractionalcalc absorption. This study focuses on the effect of proton pump-inhibitors on bone mineral density in patients with low Bone Mineral Density. The results suggest that risedronates may be more efficacious than conventional methods for treating Osteolisis; however, there is no association between PPM use and hip fracture.

The purpose here was to determine how abnormal median sensory nervous conduction among acutely symptomatized workers was predictive on future symptoms suggestively of carpal Tunnel Syndrome. In this study, subjects who reported painful, nagness, burning, and other pain in the body were classified as either having CTT symptoms or having home-related complaints. After 70 months, subjects became symptomatic but did not develop CTS over an extended duration. To further investigate whether different information may influence reporting of symptoms suspicious of poor indoorclimate at the work or at home, we examined 1,710 subjects sent by the general health mail survey in February 1997 asking about pain, nausea, and nigling in any parts of the body. Following two months later, clinical examination and Nerve conductive testing of responder reporting symptoms in their median nerve distribution within the he and s showed signs of CTS.

Laparotically assisted vaginal hyersterectomy compared with abdominal hyingsterectomy in endometria. This study compares laparoscopicly assisted vagusal haesterectomy with abscesses in stage Iendometrial disease.

However in trials that tested vitamin C after cold symptoms occurred , there was some evidence that a large dose produced greater benefits than lower doses .
REVIEW ER 'S CONCLUSIONS Long term daily supplementation with vitamin C in large doses daily does not appear to prevent colds .","In this paper, the effects of ascorbbic acid on colds are compared to that of placebo in two double blind studies. The results seem to be somewhat divergent; however, there is no evidence of an efficacy or safety in either group. A double blind trial compares the use of large dosages of ascotbic acid to prevent common colds in healthy adults. There is little difference in the duration and extent of colds between the four groups. However, both groups have shorter and less serious illness episodes. This study does not prove that they can prevent colds. It also does not show any effect on other colds such as coughing or sore throats. Although some people claim that it is possible to reduce colds by taking large doses with extra dosages at the beginning of their illness, these studies do not provide any evidence of beneficial effects.",0.0022863058517707193

The results suggest that sitting time is associated with premature mortality but not from all causes. Although physicians should avoid sitting for long periods of time, studies have shown that regular breakfast consumption has a beneficial effect on overweight and obesity in India. This paper reports on the frequency of daily breakfast consumption among eight school-going Indian girls. It finds that boys are more likely to consume breakfast than girls, while girls who only sometimes or never consume breakfast are less likely to do so.

The first two studies describe the use of restrictive or liberal autologous transplants in patients who undergo total knee replacement. In the first group, only half of the patients receive autologously; in the second group, they receive both types of transfusions. Both groups have shorter hospital stays than those receiving allogenic transfusion except for patients with high preoperative haemologlobin level.

Two studies are presented: one on brief group therapy for patients with myocarital infa ""rct"" ion; and another on short-term stress management for patients after an acutemyocardially infpa r Ct  Ion. These studies report that depression is not treated well after surgery because many patients die too soon to finish the intervention. Another study describes a program designed to support patients in behavior change and moodmanagement. It has been reported that exercise training reduces mortality but does not affect late Morton's survival. Blacks have primarily high rates of heart disease due to psychological distress. They also suffer from anxiety and depression. One of the most important reasons for this disparity is that blacks tend to have higher blood pressure than whites. Therefore, these studies suggest that mental health problems may contribute to the disparity between men and women. For example, depressed patients often experience greater morbidity than other patients. Thus, it is necessary to develop methods for treating depression and lowsocial support in patients following an acute myofa rect icon.

Children born by assisted reproduction techniques are more mentally and socially developed than naturally conceived controls. However, some gender- specific differences do exist. Within the Art group, both IVF and CCSI children exhibit lower levels of mental health problems than those in their parents' reports. A dropout rate for fathers is very high, and mothers are biased for older generations of both parents.",0.016845986977427337

He compares the efficacy of two different methods for treating such fractures: percutaneous pining and external fixations. The results show that the De palma group has better pain scores than the external fixators after six months but that the latter group is not clinical relevant. A prospective trial was conducted to determine whether volar locking plating or internal fixation could be more effective in relieving distal radius-friction. Thirteen trials met the inclusion requirements; all had evidence supporting reliability, validity, andresponsiveness. However, some were excluded because they did not have adequate patient-report outcome measures. This paper investigates the effect of volar lock plating on patients with unstable dormsly displaced disctal radius fracture who are treated either by closed reduction or internally fixation. At three and six months, both groups have improved their pain scores. They also report improvement in grip strength at 12 months. These studies further demonstrate that mirror therapy can improve functional outcomes in patients with an active range of movement.",0.1487351359761988

The results show significant improvement in pain, function, and satisfaction at all follow up times for either group. A significant interaction occurs between the patient'sglobal rating of change after four weeks as compared against eight weeks or 16 weeks. This suggests that patients with sub-acronial impringement syndrome demonstrate improved pain and function even though they do not have surgery.",0.012602712362301299

They develop a ""consot-ealth"" statement that describes how best to report evidence in eHealth or mH intervention. This statement is used as a guide to assist authors in reporting their studies. The first study reports on a novel early intervention for young children with an autistic spectrum disorder called Toby. It was a mixed-effects trial: there was no significant difference in scores between the two groups; however, there were significant improvements in performance at the six month follow-up. However, some families found it difficult to continue using the app after the full six-month period.",0.28669798140840386
20565960,"An acceptability analysis showed that SSRIs were generally well tolerated .
Conclusions These results suggest that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no differences in efficacy between SSRIs and placebo in the treatment of depression in PD .","In this study, we compare the efficaciousness of low dose fluoxenin and that of low-dose amitriptylines in controlling depression. 77 patients with a mean age of 69.2 years were divided into two groups: group 1 received fluonoxetin 20 40mg/day; group 2 received ami triptyline 40ml/day. The results showed that both groups improved their scores on the Hamilton Depression Scores but only one group fell out of the treatment group because of sideeffects. A further study was performed to determine whether dopamine can be used as an alternative to depressants in patients with motor defects. This study concludes that it is important to use dophin agonists for the treatment of motor complications in patients who have been suffering from Parkinson's disease.",0.7733438247304126

No moderating variables related to method ological , sample or study characteristics were supported in the analysis ; age was a potential moderating variable .
Summary / conclusions We provide the first meta-analytical review of football heading effects aggregated from multiple studies and extended findings from a recent systematic review of the effects of football heading .
Our analysis indicates no overall effect for heading a football on adverse outcomes","In this study, we examine the relationship of neck strength, impact, and neuropsychognitive function during an acute bout in a female high school team. We find no significant changes in postural controls after heading, but there are some negative correlations between neck strength to resultant head acceleration. Further studies are needed to determine whether or not head injuries cause changes in brain function. Athlettes perform five kicking and heading balls over a 10-minute period at 30 mph, 40 nmh, or 50 mph. No significant differences in head impact speed were found between ball velocity group over time on Sp100B; there was no significant interaction effects between head impact groups over time. This study furthermore adds to our limited knowledge regarding head strikes in youth soccer players. It is reported that males tend to lead the ball more often than females. The results of this study suggest that any Purported effects of Soccer heading in youth may affect only small numbers of athletes.",0.019210042316939614

There was no evidence of any serious harm caused by statin prescription .
Evidence available to date showed that primary prevention with statins is likely to be cost-effective and may improve patient quality of life .
Recent findings from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists study using individual patient data meta- analysis indicate that these benefits are similar in people at lower ( < 1 % per year ) risk of a major cardiovascular event .

30128767,Conclusion The Nordic dietary pattern  improves blood pressure and also some of blood lipid markers and it should be considered as a healthy dietary pattern,"In this study, we examine the effects of an eight-week diet on lipids. The results indicate that the diet reduces both total and lowdensity Lipoprotein concentrations in men and women by a greater amount than does the Danish diet. We conclude that a high fat, high fiber diet can not only reduce atherogenic tendencies but also the ""thrombogenic"" tendency of individual compared to a diet similar to the average Dane dietStudies 1: Body mass index is measured as a measure of body weight. After 12 weeks, subjects lose their weight more rapidly than they did before. This study was registered at trial.

30591077,"Results Based on consistent evidence from studies that were rated as moderate or strong , there is good evidence that military weight management interventions are effective in improving body composition for duration s of up to 12 months .
Effective interventions are more likely to be high intensity ( have a greater number of sessions ) , are more often delivered by specialists , and use theoretical base/behavioral change techniques and a st and ardized guideline .
Dietary interventions can potentially reduce total fat and saturated fat intake .
Dietary interventions that target the kitchen staff and /or increase the availability of healthy food are more likely to be effective in the short term .
The results regarding military physical fitness interventions were inconclusive .
Conclusion Despite limitations such as the diversity and heterogeneity of the included interventions , outcome measurements , and follow-up duration , this systematic review found good evidence that weight management interventions are effective , especially in terms of weight loss .","The Air Force's ""Weigh to Stay"" weight-management regimen is a successful program that improves fitness and reduces body fat among overweight military men. However, it does not lead to significant weight loss in either group. In contrast, the meal replacement program loses more weight than Weigh to stay volunteers. This suggests that meal replacements may be useful as an adjunct strategy to exercise training. Soldiers attending Weigh To Stay at Fort Brgg, N.C., in 2006./2007 are randomed to replace two meal replacement per day with meals provided by commercially available food replacements. After six months of follow-up, both groups lose significant weight. They lose fat mass but lose lean mass. A higher body Mass Index is associated with exercises-related injuries",0.0265743368742502

Persons with chronic LBP with high levels of disability are also likely to have low levels of physical activity .
Persons with acute or subacute back pain appear to vary in the levels of physical activity independent of disability .
Persons with chronic back pain with high levels of disability will likely have low levels of physical activity","This paper describes a trial of two different types of exercises for patients with chronic back pain. The first is grade-d activity; the second is motor control exercise. In this trial, 100 and 7ty two patients will be randomly assigned to receive either one of these two treatment approaches. Measures are obtained at two, six and 12 months later. A primary outcome is pain over the last weeks and function on the patient-specified functional scale. All subjects in the home group have lower movement time than the intensely trained group. Free living physical activity has been shown to predict recovery in patients with lowback pain but no studies have examined whether it can predict recovery from other kinds of exercise. Two trials were conducted: 1) an observational longitudinal program that investigates free living physical activities in a peer-revised cohort of adults who had acute and subacute high back pain; and 2) a controlled trial of three different forms of rehabilitation for patients suffering from chronic low back painful. Both groups experienced significant reductions in their pain intensity and function after 10 weeks. However, there were no differences in pain or function between the combined treatments. Three studies were performed: 1) a study of consecutive workers seeking care for low back Pain; 2) comparing high- and Low-Intensity Back School with usual care; and 3) a five-year prospective cohort study of men and woman seeking care because of persistent back pain during a year's follow up period. These studies found no effects of physical exercise upon recovery from low back pain in women and men.",0.9945966592458417
25639643,Longer duration of electrocardiographic monitoring after cryptogenic stroke is associated with a greater detection of AF .,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the efficacy and drawbacks of ECG-monitoring in patients with an acute stroke. They conclude that it is important to use continuous ECG tracking to detect atrium fibrillation because it can lead to complications. The study also discusses the use of long-lived Holter electrodes as an aid in detecting paroxismal atary fibrillations. A significant proportionof strokes are classified as cryptogenetic by the presence of intermittent atonic fibrillating. Thirtying cardiac event monitor devices may increase the frequency of attriotic arrhythmies but do not improve detection rates. For example, one patient with frequent attic premature beats shows more frequently atrial fibrilation than those with frequent or infrequent ones. These studies further advance the notion that prolonged ECG observation will be useful for detecting unknown atrial fillation.",0.937099244691853

Safe dosage for ALA is up to 1200 mg/day .
However , it seems that ALA can not be cost-effective .","In this study, a group of overweight women following an energy restriction diet loses significantly more weight in the control group than in the other two groups. The results suggest that ecstasy and  lipoic acid might help to promote weight loss in these women. Aim: To determine whether or not alphalipoic-acidic treatment can improve body weight loss for patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitateus. This is based on a double blinded placebo-control study. After 10 weeks, all groups follow an energy restricted diet. Body weight, anthropometry measurements, body composition, resting energie expenditure, blood pressure, serum glucose, and Insulin and Ghrelin profiles were assessed at baseline and afterwards. Results showed that body weight Loss was significantly higher in those groups who supplemented With - Lipoic Acid.

Thus , both material s appear equally suitable for clinical application as a fissure sealant material","In this study, the aim of the paper is to compare the ""caries preventive"" effect of glass Ionomer with a polymerized sealant over time. Forty seven children and 57 females were divided into two groups: one group was placed in 180 first morals after three years; the other group was composed of four teeth. After five years, both groups lost their sealants. The results of the study indicate that the carious-preventative effect of these two types of sealants is greater than that of any other type of sealant for at least 3 years. This conclusion supports the claim that high-visscosity glassionomers have a better chance of stopping caries than those of light-cursed composite resin sealers over a 1 to 3 year period. A further study is performed to determine the relative risks of caries development on newly sealed teeth when compared to tooth-sealated resin sealants under different conditions.",0.9938927375916564

23235652,There is no convincing evidence that zinc supplementation to infants or children results in improved motor or mental development,"In this study, Dr. Lira examines the effect of prenatal zinc on infants born in low-birth weight who have poor mental and physical development. The results suggest that zinc may be able to improve these children's mental and emotional health. A double blinded, part-blind, controlled trial is conducted in Peru to determine whether maternal zinc deficition during pregnancy can reduce the deficits found in mental and psychological development. This trial involves two groups: 1) pregnant women receive daily zinc; 2) mothers receive only a placebo; and 3) infants receive either an eight-week regimen of zinc or a six-month regimen of iron and/or zinc alone. Although there are no significant differences between the three groups, it is concluded that both groups benefit from increased growth and motor development. Two studies indicate that combined iron andzinc supplementation might help prevent infectious disease during early childhood. These studies also show that zinc does not induce changes in mental health but increases in blood lead concentration. Children with higher blood lead levels do not suffer longer than those with lower blood zinc concentrations.",0.034761108640991696
