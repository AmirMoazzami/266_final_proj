METHODS We conducted a double-blind , r and omized clinical trial to investigate whether levosimendan reduces the severity of organ dysfunction in adults with sepsis . Patients were r and omly assigned to receive a blinded infusion of levosimendan ( at a dose of 0.05 to 0.2 μg per kilogram of body weight per minute ) for 24 hours or placebo in addition to st and ard care . The primary outcome was the mean daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score in the intensive care unit up to day 28 ( scores for each of five systems range from 0 to 4 , with higher scores indicating more severe dysfunction ; maximum score , 20 ) . Secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality , time to weaning from mechanical ventilation , and adverse events . RESULTS The trial recruited 516 patients ; 259 were assigned to receive levosimendan and 257 to receive placebo  . There was no significant difference in the mean ( ±SD ) SOFA score between the levosimendan group and the placebo group ( 6.68±3.96 vs. 6.06±3.89 ; mean difference , 0.61 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , -0.07 to 1.29 ; P=0.053 ) . Mortality at 28 days was 34.5 % in the levosimendan group and 30.9 % in the placebo group ( absolute difference , 3.6 percentage points ; 95 % CI , -4.5 to 11.7 ; P=0.43 ) . Among patients requiring ventilation at baseline , those in the levosimendan group were less likely than those in the placebo group to be successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation over the period of 28 days ( hazard ratio , 0.77 ; 95 % CI , 0.60 to 0.97 ; P=0.03 ) . More patients in the levosimendan group than in the placebo group had supraventricular tachyarrhythmia ( 3.1 % vs. 0.4 % ; absolute difference , 2.7 percentage points ; 95 % CI , 0.1 to 5.3 ; P=0.04 ) . CONCLUSIONS The addition of levosimendan to st and ard treatment in adults with sepsis was not associated with less severe organ dysfunction or lower mortality .  Levosimendan was associated with a lower likelihood of successful weaning from mechanical ventilation and a higher risk of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia .

       "  'Background — We determined the effects of levosimendan , a calcium sensitizer , on left ventricular ( LV ) diastolic function in patients with LV hypertrophy . Methods and Results — In this prospect i ve , r and omized , blinded study , 23 patients received either levosimendan ( 0.1 and 0.2 & mgr;g · kg−1 · min−1 ; n=12 ) or placebo ( n=11 ) after aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis . The effects on LV performance , dimensions , filling patterns , and isovolumic relaxation time , as well as systemic hemodynamics , were assessed by pulmonary artery thermodilution catheterization and transesophageal 2-dimensional Doppler echocardiography . To circumvent the confounding effects of the levosimendan-induced hemodynamic changes on Doppler echocardiographic indexes of LV early relaxation , heart rate and mean arterial and central venous pressures were kept constant during levosimendan/placebo infusion by atrial pacing , vasopressor , and colloid infusions . In the levosimendan group , dose-dependent increases in cardiac output ( 28 % ; P<0.001 ) and stroke volume ( 26 % ; P<0.001 ) and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance ( −22 % ; P<0.001 ) were observed . There was a trend for an increase in LV ejection fraction ( 12 % ; P=0.058 ) with levosimendan . There were no significant differences in systolic , diastolic arterial , or LV filling pressures or LV end-diastolic area between the 2 groups . Isovolumic relaxation time decreased ( −23 % ; P<0.001 ) , as did the deceleration slope of early diastolic filling ( −45 % ; P<0.01 ) , whereas peak early diastolic filling velocity ( 16 % , P<0.01 ) and peak late diastolic filling velocity ( 15 % ; P<0.001 ) increased after levosimendan compared with placebo . Conclusion — Levosimendan , in addition to its inotropic effects , exerts a direct positive lusitropic effect in patients with LV hypertrophy as it shortens isovolumic relaxation time and improves LV filling',\n",
       "  'Introduction The purpose of the present study was to investigate microcirculatory blood flow in patients with septic shock treated with levosimendan  as compared to an active comparator drug ( i.e. dobutamine ) . The primary end point was a difference of ≥ 20 % in the microvascular flow index of small vessels ( MFIs ) among groups . Methods The study was design ed as a prospect i ve , r and omized , double-blind clinical trial and performed in a multidisciplinary intensive care unit . After achieving normovolemia and a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mmHg , 40 septic shock patients were r and omized to receive either levosimendan 0.2 μg·kg-1·min-1 ( n = 20 ) or an active comparator ( dobutamine 5 μg·kg-1·min-1 ; control ; n = 20 ) for 24 hours . Sublingual microcirculatory blood flow of small and medium vessels was assessed by sidestream dark-field imaging . Microcirculatory variables and data from right heart catheterization were obtained at baseline and 24 hours after r and omization . Baseline and demographic data were compared by means of Mann-Whitney rank sum test or chi-square test , as appropriate . Microvascular and hemodynamic variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney rank sum test . Results Microcirculatory flow indices of small and medium vessels increased over time and were significantly higher in the levosimendan group as compared to the control group ( 24 hrs : MFIm 3.0 ( 3.0 ; 3.0 ) vs. 2.9 ( 2.8 ; 3.0 ) ; P = .02 ; MFIs 2.9 ( 2.9 ; 3.0 ) vs. 2.7 ( 2.3 ; 2.8 ) ; P < .001 ) . The relative increase of perfused vessel density vs. baseline was significantly higher in the levosimendan group than in the control group ( dMFIm 10 ( 3 ; 23)% vs. 0 ( -1 ; 9)% ; P = .007 ; dMFIs 47 ( 26 ; 83)% vs. 10 ( -3 ; 27 ) ; P < .001 ) . In addition , the heterogeneity index decreased only in the levosimendan group ( dHI -93 ( -100 ; -84)% vs. 0 ( -78 ; 57)% ; P < .001 ) . There was no statistically significant correlation between systemic and microcirculatory flow variables within each group ( each P > .05 ) . Conclusions Compared to a st and ard dose of 5 μg·kg-1·min-1 of dobutamine , levosimendan at 0.2 μg·kg-1·min-1 improved sublingual microcirculatory blood flow in patients with septic shock , as reflected by changes in microcirculatory flow indices of small and medium vessels .

       "  'Background We aim ed to investigate the effect of levosimendan on biomarkers of myocardial injury and systemic hemodynamics in patients with septic shock . Material / Methods After achieving normovolemia and a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mmHg , 38 septic shock patients with low cardiac output ( left ventricular ejective fraction ) , LEVF ≤45 % ) were r and omly divided into two groups : levosimendan dobutamine . Patients in the levosimendan and dobutamine groups were maintained with intravenous infusion of levosimendan ( 0.2 μg/kg/minute ) and dobutamine ( 5 μg/kg/minute ) for 24 hours respectively . During treatment we monitored hemodynamics and LVEF , and measured levels of heart-type fatty acid binding protein ( HFABP ) , troponin I ( TNI ) , and brain natriuretic peptide(BNP ) . In addition , the length of mechanical ventilation , intensive care unit ( ICU ) stay , hospital stay , and 28-day mortality were compared between the two groups . Results The levosimendan group and the dobutamine group were well matched with respect to age ( years , 55.4±1 7.5 versus 50.2±13.6 ) and gender ( males , 68.4 % versus 57.9 % ) . Levosimendan-treated patients had higher stroke volume index ( SVI ) , cardiac index ( CI ) , LVEF , and left ventricular stroke work index ( LVSWI ) , and lower extravascular lung water index ( EVLWI ) compared to dobutamine-treated patients ( p<0.05 ) . HFABP , TNI , and BNP in the levosimendan group were less than in the dobutamine group ( p<0.05 ) . There was no difference in the mechanical ventilation time , length of stay in ICU and hospital , and 28-day mortality between the two groups . Conclusions Compared with dobutamine , levosimendan  reduces biomarkers of myocardial injury and improves systemic hemodynamics in patients with septic shock . However , it does not reduce the days on mechanical ventilation , length of stay in ICU and hospital , or 28-day mortality',\n",
       "  'OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of levosimendan on hemodynamics and cardiac function in patients with septic shock . METHODS A prospect i ve single-center r and omized controlled trial was conducted . The patients with septic shock admitted to the Department of Critical Care Medicine of the Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University from June 2011 to October 2013 were enrolled . The patients with septic shock received the conventional treatment according to international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock . Thirty-six patients received the examination of echocardiography and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)≤ 0.45 after fluid resuscitation were enrolled the study , who were divided into two groups according to r and om number table , with 18 cases in each group . After the conventional treatment , the patients in dobutamine group received intravenous injection of 5 μg × kg⁻¹ min⁻¹ dobutamine for 48 hours immediately after fluid resuscitation , and those in levosimendan group received a 24-hour infusion of 5 μg × kg⁻¹ min⁻¹ dobutamine followed by a 24-hour infusion of 0.2 μg × kg⁻¹ × min⁻¹ levosimendan . The hemodynamics and cardiac function were evaluated by pulse indicator continuous cardiac output ( PiCCO ) and ultrasound during treatment . RESULTS Compared with dobutamine group , after the treatment in the levosimendan  group , stroke volume index ( SVI ) , cardiac index ( CI ) and left ventricular stroke work index ( LVSWI ) were significantly increased [ SVI ( mL/m² ) : 39.8 ± 5.4 vs. 37.5 ± 4.5 , t=-2.762 , P=0.020 ; CI ( L × min⁻¹ × m⁻² ) : 4.6 ± 0.7 vs. 3.6 ± 0.7 , t=-9.829 , P=0.000 ; LVSWI ( kg ×min⁻ ¹ m⁻² ) : 33.7 ± 2.4 vs. 28.2 ± 1.2 , t=-6.307 , P=0.000 ] , and central venous pressure ( CVP ) , intrathoracic blood volume index ( ITBVI ) and extravascular lung water index ( EVLWI ) were significantly decreased [ CVP ( mmHg , 1 mmHg=0.133 kPa ) : 8.2 ± 0.9 vs. 12.1 ± 0.8 , t=3.928 , P=0.002 ; ITBVI ( mL/m² ) : 820 ± 42 vs. 978 ± 69 , t=9.472 , P=0.000 ; EVLWI ( mL/kg ) : 6.1 ± 1.6 vs. 8.9 ± 1.7 , t=4.467 , P=0.001 ] . Cardiac ultrasound showed that compared with dobutamine group , in the levosimendan  group , left ventricular end-systolic volume ( LVESI ) and end-diastolic volume ( LVEDI ) were significantly lowered [ LVESI ( mL/m² ) : 32.7 ± 9.2 vs. 48.2 ± 13.4 , t=0.882 , P=0.000 ; LVEDI ( mL/m² ) : 61.7 ± 11.4 vs. 78.6 ± 13.6 , t=2.453 , P=0.032 ] , and the LVEF was significantly increased ( 0.463 ± 0.068 vs. 0.383 ± .085 , t=-2.439 , P=0.035 ) . Levosimendan also could decrease the lactic acid ( mmol/L : 3.4 ± 1.1 vs. 5.2 ± 1.2 , t=3.346 , P=0.007 ) , and increase the lactate clearance rate ( mL/min : 73.2 ± 13.5 vs. 47.6 ± 11.8 , t=-4.079 , P=0.002 ) , 24-hour urinary output ( mL : 2 213.4 ± 354.0 vs. 1 533.8 ± 402.0 , t=6.342 , P=0.000 ) and 24-hour cumulative intake ( mL : 5 746.6 ± 420.0 vs. 4 156.7 ± 215.0 , t=7.126 , P=0.000 ) . There were no significant differences in total volume of norepinephrine , mortality in intensive care unit ( ICU ) and 28-day mortality between two groups  . CONCLUSIONS Levosimendan can increase cardiac ejection function , reduce the heart blood and vascular preload , intrathoracic lung water , improve heart function and systemic hemodynamic indexes of patients with septic shock',\n",
       "  'This r and omized , placebo-controlled trial showed that levosimendan administration causes a significant reduction of circulating proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 and soluble apoptosis mediators , such as soluble Fas and Fas lig and in patients with decompensated heart failure . These immunomodulatory effects may lead to improvement of symptoms and echocardiographic markers of cardiac contractile performance in these patients',\n",
       "  'Dynamic positron emission tomography ( PET ) with [11C]acetate allows noninvasive assessment of myocardial oxygen consumption . In combination with echocardiography , PET enables determination of cardiac efficiency ( defined as useful cardiac work per unit of oxygen consumption ) . We used this approach to compare the effects of levosimendan , a Ca2+‐dependent calcium sensitizer , with dobutamine and sodium nitroprusside in healthy male volunteers . The effects of levosimendan  on kmono , an index of oxygen consumption , and cardiac efficiency were neutral , whereas the hemodynamic profile was consistent with balanced inotropism and vasodilatation . Dobutamine enhanced cardiac efficiency at the expense of increased oxygen requirement , but the effects of nitroprusside on kmono and cardiac efficiency were neutral . This study shows the feasibility of PET in phase 1 pharmacodynamic studies and suggests potential energetical advantages of calcium sensitization with levosimendan',\n",
       "  'BACKGROUND Septic shock is the leading causes of death in intensive care units . In addition to generous fluid administration , inotropic agents are commonly used to improve cardiac output . The effects of inotropic agents on regional blood flow remains unknown . OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the effects of levosimendan vs dobutamine added to dopamine on liver functions assessed using noninvasive liver function monitoring ( LiMON ) in patients with septic shock . DESIGN Prospect i ve analysis . MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS We analyzed 30 patients with septic shock who were treated in an intensive care unit .  Indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate ( ICG-PDR ) was conducted concurrently using the LiMON system . A dose of 0.3 mg/kg ICG was given through a cubital fossa vein as a bolus . RESULTS Statistical analysis showed that the variation of hemodynamic variables was different between groups . In our results , the increase in systolic blood pressure , diastolic blood pressure , and mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in levosimendan group than in dobutamine group ( P < .05 ) . There was a decrease in before- and after-infusion ICG-PDR values in dobutamine group ( 20.38 ± 4.83 vs 20.34 ± 5.30 ) , and no statistical difference was detected ( P = .649 ) . There was an increase in before- and after-infusion ICG-PDR values  in levosimendan group ( 18.70 ± 2.59 vs 21.65 ± 3.20 ) , and a statistical difference was detected ( P = .001 ) . There was statistical difference between groups ( P = .000 ) . CONCLUSION These results suggest that levosimendan added to dopamine  improves systemic hemodynamics and increases splanchnic perfusion assessed using the user-friendly noninvasive bedside system LiMON in patients with septic shock compared with dobutamine',\n",
       "  'Purpose The role of dobutamine during septic shock resuscitation is still controversial since most clinical studies have been uncontrolled and no physiological study has unequivocally demonstrated a beneficial effect on tissue perfusion . Our objective was to determine the potential benefits of dobutamine on hemodynamic , metabolic , peripheral , hepatosplanchnic and microcirculatory perfusion parameters during early septic shock resuscitation . Methods We design ed a r and omized , controlled , double-blind , crossover study comparing the effects of 2.5-h infusion of dobutamine ( 5 mcg/kg/min fixed-dose ) or placebo in 20 septic shock patients with cardiac index ≥2.5 l/min/m2 and hyperlactatemia . Primary outcome was sublingual perfused microvascular density . Results Despite an increasing cardiac index , heart rate and left ventricular ejection fraction , dobutamine had no effect on sublingual perfused vessel density [ 9.0 ( 7.9–10.1 ) vs. 9.1 n/mm ( 7.9–9.9 ) ; p = 0.24 ] or microvascular flow index [ 2.1 ( 1.8–2.5 ) vs. 2.1 ( 1.9–2.5 ) ; p = 0.73 ] compared to placebo . No differences between dobutamine and placebo were found for the lactate levels , mixed venous-arterial pCO2 gradient , thenar muscle oxygen saturation , capillary refill time or gastric-to-arterial pCO2 gradient . The indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate [ 14.4 ( 9.5–25.6 ) vs. 18.8 % /min ( 11.7–24.6 ) ; p = 0.03 ] and the recovery slope of thenar muscle oxygen saturation after a vascular occlusion test [ 2.1 ( 1.1–3.1 ) vs. 2.5 % /s ( 1.2–3.4 ) ; p = 0.01 ] were worse with dobutamine compared to placebo . Conclusions Dobutamine failed to improve sublingual microcirculatory , metabolic , hepatosplanchnic or peripheral perfusion parameters despite inducing a significant increase in systemic hemodynamic variables in septic shock patients without low cardiac output but with persistent hypoperfusion',\n",
       "  'IMPORTANCE Norepinephrine is currently recommended as the first-line vasopressor in septic shock ; however , early vasopressin use has been proposed as an alternative . OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of early vasopressin vs norepinephrine on kidney failure in patients with septic shock . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS A factorial ( 2 × 2 ) , double-blind , r and omized clinical trial conducted in 18 general adult intensive care units in the United Kingdom between February 2013 and May 2015 , enrolling adult patients who had septic shock requiring vasopressors despite fluid resuscitation within a maximum of 6 hours after the onset of shock . INTERVENTIONS Patients were r and omly allocated to vasopressin ( titrated up to 0.06 U/min ) and hydrocortisone ( n = 101 ) , vasopressin and placebo ( n = 104 ) , norepinephrine and hydrocortisone ( n = 101 ) , or norepinephrine and placebo ( n = 103 ) . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was kidney failure-free days during the 28-day period after r and omization , measured as ( 1 ) the proportion of patients who never developed kidney failure and ( 2 ) median number of days alive and free of kidney failure for patients who did not survive , who experienced kidney failure , or both . Rates of renal replacement therapy , mortality , and serious adverse events were secondary outcomes . RESULTS A total of 409 patients ( median age , 66 years ; men , 58.2 % ) were included in the study , with a median time to study drug administration of 3.5 hours after diagnosis of shock . The number of survivors who never developed kidney failure was 94 of 165 patients ( 57.0 % ) in the vasopressin group and 93 of 157 patients ( 59.2 % ) in the norepinephrine group ( difference , -2.3 % [ 95 % CI , -13.0 % to 8.5 % ] ) . The median number of kidney failure-free days for patients who did not survive , who experienced kidney failure , or both was 9 days ( interquartile range [ IQR ] , 1 to -24 ) in the vasopressin group and 13 days ( IQR , 1 to -25 ) in the norepinephrine group ( difference , -4 days [ 95 % CI , -11 to 5 ] ) . There was less use of renal replacement therapy in the vasopressin group than in the norepinephrine group ( 25.4 % for vasopressin vs 35.3 % for norepinephrine ; difference , -9.9 % [ 95 % CI , -19.3 % to -0.6 % ] ) . There was no significant difference in mortality rates between groups . In total , 22 of 205 patients ( 10.7 % ) had a serious adverse event in the vasopressin group vs 17 of 204 patients ( 8.3 % ) in the norepinephrine group ( difference , 2.5 % [ 95 % CI , -3.3 % to 8.2 % ] ) . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with septic shock , the early use of vasopressin compared with norepinephrine did not improve the number of kidney failure-free days . Although these findings do not support the use of vasopressin to replace norepinephrine as initial treatment in this situation , the confidence interval included a potential clinical ly important benefit for vasopressin , and larger trials may be warranted to assess this further .

       " 'summary': 'The primary outcome was the mean daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score in the intensive care unit up to day 28 ( scores for each of five systems range from 0 to 4 , with higher scores indicating more severe dysfunction ; maximum score , 20 ) . Secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality , time to weaning from mechanical ventilation , and adverse events . More patients in the levosimendan group than in the placebo group had supraventricular tachyarrhythmia ( 3.1 % vs. 0.4 % ; absolute difference , 2.7 percentage points ; 95 % CI , 0.1 to 5.3 ; P=0.04 ) . ( Funded by the NIHR Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation Programme and others ; LeoPARDS Current Controlled Trials number , IS RCT N12776039 . ) METHODS We conducted a double-blind , r and omized clinical trial to investigate whether levosimendan reduces the severity of organ dysfunction in adults with sepsis . The effects on LV performance , dimensions , filling patterns , and isovolumic relaxation time , as well as systemic hemodynamics , were assessed by pulmonary artery thermodilution catheterization and transesophageal 2-dimensional Doppler echocardiography . In the levosimendan group , dose-dependent increases in cardiac output ( 28 % ; P<0.001 ) and stroke volume ( 26 % ; P<0.001 ) and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance ( −22 % ; P<0.001 ) were observed . Conclusion — Levosimendan , in addition to its inotropic effects , exerts a direct positive lusitropic effect in patients with LV hypertrophy as it shortens isovolumic relaxation time and improves LV filling Methods and Results — In this prospect i ve , r and omized , blinded study , 23 patients received either levosimendan ( 0.1 and 0.2 & mgr;g · kg−1 · min−1 ; n=12 ) or placebo ( n=11 ) after aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis . There were no significant differences in systolic , diastolic arterial , or LV filling pressures or LV end-diastolic area between the 2 groups . Microvascular and hemodynamic variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney rank sum test . The relative increase of perfused vessel density vs. baseline was significantly higher in the levosimendan group than in the control group ( dMFIm 10 ( 3 ; 23)% vs. 0 ( -78 ; 57)% ; P < .001 ) . Trial registration NCT00800306 vs. 2.7 ( 2.3 ; 2.8 ) ; Levosimendan-treated patients had higher stroke volume index ( SVI ) , cardiac index ( CI ) , LVEF , and left ventricular stroke work index ( LVSWI ) , and lower extravascular lung water index ( EVLWI ) compared to dobutamine-treated patients ( p<0.05 ) . There was no difference in the mechanical ventilation time , length of stay in ICU and hospital , and 28-day mortality between the two groups . Conclusions Compared with dobutamine , levosimendan  reduces biomarkers of myocardial injury and improves systemic hemodynamics in patients with septic shock . Results The levosimendan group and the dobutamine group were well matched with respect to age ( years , 55.4±1 7.5 versus 50.2±13.6 ) and gender ( males , 68.4 % versus 57.9 % ) . Patients in the levosimendan and dobutamine groups were maintained with intravenous infusion of levosimendan ( 0.2 μg/kg/minute ) and dobutamine ( 5 μg/kg/minute ) for 24 hours respectively . OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of levosimendan on hemodynamics and cardiac function in patients with septic shock . Cardiac ultrasound showed that compared with dobutamine group , in the levosimendan  group , left ventricular end-systolic volume ( LVESI ) and end-diastolic volume ( LVEDI ) were significantly lowered [ LVESI ( mL/m² ) : 32.7 ± 9.2 vs. 48.2 ± 13.4 , t=0.882 , P=0.000 ; LVEDI ( mL/m² ) : 61.7 ± 11.4 vs. 78.6 ± 13.6 , t=2.453 , P=0.032 ] , and the LVEF was significantly increased ( 0.463 ± 0.068 vs. 0.383 ± .085 , t=-2.439 , P=0.035 ) . × kg⁻¹ × METHODS A prospect i ve single-center r and omized controlled trial was conducted . Thirty-six patients received the examination of echocardiography and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)≤ 0.45 after fluid resuscitation were enrolled the study , who were divided into two groups according to r and om number table , with 18 cases in each group . This r and omized , placebo-controlled trial showed that levosimendan administration causes a significant reduction of circulating proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 and soluble apoptosis mediators , such as soluble Fas and Fas lig and in patients with decompensated heart failure . These immunomodulatory effects may lead to improvement of symptoms and echocardiographic markers of cardiac contractile performance in these patients Dynamic positron emission tomography ( PET ) with [11C]acetate allows noninvasive assessment of myocardial oxygen consumption . We used this approach to compare the effects of levosimendan , a Ca2+‐dependent calcium sensitizer , with dobutamine and sodium nitroprusside in healthy male volunteers . The effects of levosimendan  on kmono , an index of oxygen consumption , and cardiac efficiency were neutral , whereas the hemodynamic profile was consistent with balanced inotropism and vasodilatation . This study shows the feasibility of PET in phase 1 pharmacodynamic studies and suggests potential energetical advantages of calcium sensitization with levosimendan In combination with echocardiography , PET enables determination of cardiac efficiency ( defined as useful cardiac work per unit of oxygen consumption ) . The effects of inotropic agents on regional blood flow remains unknown . DESIGN Prospect i ve analysis . There was statistical difference between groups ( P = .000 ) . BACKGROUND Septic shock is the leading causes of death in intensive care units . There was an increase in before- and after-infusion ICG-PDR values  in levosimendan group ( 18.70 ± 2.59 vs 21.65 ± 3.20 ) , and a statistical difference was detected ( P = .001 ) . Purpose The role of dobutamine during septic shock resuscitation is still controversial since most clinical studies have been uncontrolled and no physiological study has unequivocally demonstrated a beneficial effect on tissue perfusion . ( 1.2–3.4 ) ; p = 0.01 ] were worse with dobutamine compared to placebo . Primary outcome was sublingual perfused microvascular density . ( 11.7–24.6 ) ; p = 0.03 ] and the recovery slope of thenar muscle oxygen saturation after a vascular occlusion test [ 2.1 ( 1.1–3.1 ) vs. 2.5 % /s Conclusions Dobutamine failed to improve sublingual microcirculatory , metabolic , hepatosplanchnic or peripheral perfusion parameters despite inducing a significant increase in systemic hemodynamic variables in septic shock patients without low cardiac output but with persistent hypoperfusion CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with septic shock , the early use of vasopressin compared with norepinephrine did not improve the number of kidney failure-free days .
