28514886,"Preterm infants are compared to breastfed children in terms of the amount of bfidophagia and their relative growth. In this study, we examine the effects of three different prebiotics on the gut microbeta: short- chain galactologosacchardes; soybean olidoischarides -- P 0.001 ; galatooligoscosacidas --P = 0.006."" The results suggest that these two different types of foods may be effective in reducing the risk of severe endogenous infections in preterm babies. We also assess the effect of several different kinds of food on newborns' motilin, gastric secretion, and lipids. A total of 160 prematurely pregnant women were randomed for either a specific formula containing long-chain glutotooligusculdes or an otherwise similar formula. This study was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of various forms of feeding regimens for both gestational and post-conceptional age groups."
18842808,"The effects of soluble fibers on serumcholesterol concentrations in healthy men were investigated. After two-wk baseline periods, the subjects received 3.9g glucoannan or placebo daily after four wK. This study showed no significant changes in body weight or blood pressure. In addition, it was found that there was an improvement in fat and lipid levels in both groups. A double-blinded cross-over trial was performed to compare the efficacy of different commercial fiber supplements on weight reduction for overweight subjects. Both groups had significant reductions with respect to their body mass index and waist circumference. However, they did not show any significant change in other measures of health. To determine whether adding dissolved fiber into a cordial diet could reduce excessively high bloodthirsty patients, this study was carried out. It was concluded that these results suggest that highly purified coconut fiber may be able to improve lipoprotein profile and cholesterol absorption in hypercholesteremic Type II patients. Two studies were conducted: one group consisted of twenty-two patients aged 64.2+ 8.4 years who had elevated blood cholesterol values but now not taking phosphorus-lowering medication; the other group included only those with type 2 disease. These patients were treated according to Bonferroni Hochberg's procedure. Results showed that compared with placebo, Klopp successfully reduced plasma cholesterol, fasting glucose, Apob, and lowdensity LDL content. Furthermore, Klumpp effectively reduced all three of these markers of heart disease as well as total/high-denisity LipoProcrisy."
24297836,"This study focuses on the association between autonomic dysfunction and acute mountain sickness. In this paper, we examine the effect of an extended period of exposure on subjects with or without symptoms of acute Mountain Sickness. Forty two subjects achieved the summit of Mount Rainiers in 34.5 hours. The group taking deXamethason reported less headaches, tiredness, dizzines, nausea, and clumsesiness at the ascent."
32367221,"Acute cruciate Ligament Reconstructions In this study, we report the results of a single-inccision ACL knee replacement procedure. After four months, there is no significant change in the severity of pain experienced by the patients in either group. The degree of Ostearthritis is more common in both groups. There are no differences in quality of life between the two different types of autograft; however, some patients may have more donor sites. For example, one patient with patellare tendon  Graft has more acute knee pain than another with hamstring or quadricep's tendencyon Autografting. Two years later, after follow-up, the same results are seen for all three groups: the quadrateps tendone group had better functional outcomes and the hyphotheis group did not. Both groups improved their knee function over time. Conclusions Based on IKDC Score evaluation and Anteroposor and Rotational Stability assessment, it can conclude that both methods of anterior ligament reconstruction give similar results."
25038833,"The results of the NameFace Association test show no significant differences between darifanacin or placebo in delayed recall. Conclusions While Darifenicin has no effect on memory, oxyButynin induces significant memory  degradation comparable to brain age of 10 years. In this study, elderly patients with mild-to-diseased brains were divided into two groups: 1) pharmacist-initated drug changes; and 2) control group. Although there was no association between the Ades score and survival time, it was not significant enough to predict future decline in mental function. This study is a prospective observational cohort study designed to examine the association among anticholinesrgic drugs and both mental and physical functions in older adults. It was found that the use of Dapas was associated with increased risk of stroke but did not lead to death."
16801507,"As vitamin K2, the effect of this treatment on bone loss is described. Bone Mineral Density in Postmenopatrasis was investigated. The BAP had reduced at month 3, but not in groups B. There was a significant reduction in the risk for fractures in both groups. In addition, there was no significant difference between the incidence of severe adverse events. Both groups received calcium and vitaminD supplements before and after the study. Strontum ranelate increases bone mineral density during the first six months. Women with osteoporesis were more likely to suffer hip fracture than those who did not. A prospective cohort study examined the influence of low-cholestrol diet on bones. It was found that lower levels of phosphorus were associated with increased risks of fracture. This study also included an assessment of the relative efficacy or otherwise of several different drugs on various bone densities. For example, it was observed that women with high bone mass showed less bone degradation when they received either alendronates or calcitonicin. However, these patients developed new vervebral fracture as well. These patients were then divided into three groups: 1) hormone replacement therapy; 2) ethidronate; and 3) vitamin D. They all lost their bone minerals within one year. After 3 years, the group receiving the additional vitaminK1 showed reduced bone loss from the lumbbar spine. When the women stopped taking the medication, their hip injury ratio fell to 0.71. Another study was performed to determine whether parathyroid Hortense's effects could be used to prevent further bone losses caused by estrogen deficiention. Parathormone has only minor sideeffects."
11676811,"In this paper, we discuss the results of a series of studies on different exercise regimens. The first study compares an intensity-based calistheics program to 'back school' for patients with low back pain who have been given only one or two weeks of physical education. This study is followed by another study in which subjects are divided into three groups: true controls; no back school; and brace orthosie. These groups do not show any change in their performance over time. However, they do show some improvement in injury rates after returning to work."
12719681,"The results of this study indicate that poor scores in the Short-Form-36 physical function scale are associated with frequent re-admits for patients with severe chest pain. A home nesbulizer is used to treat these patients. In addition, exercise at home improves quality of life. This improvement is not related to improved lung function or exercise tolerance. Physicians provide lower unsatisfactory scores than patients; however, there is a significant improvement in short-term health and well being in patients who have severe asthma."
26830881,"In a long-term follow-up trial of patients with generalised anxiety disorder, the mean daily doses of paroXetine and calorpramine were maintained over the next 34 months. The results showed that both treatments reduced the frequency of panic attacks but improved sleep disturbances in both groups. This study also shows that pregabaline is more effective than other drugs in treating panic disorder. A large proportion of the improvement in symptoms was due to the direct effect of pre gabalin rather than by improvements in severity of anxiety symptoms. Both treatment groups had similar scores on the Hamilton anxiety scale. After six months of treatment, however, only one predictor of recovery was found: low scores from the Eyenck neurotomatic scale; no adverse events occurred. Paroxertine was significantly better than placebo and even as effective as clomiprimine in the longer term treatment of anxious disorder."" Venlafaxine's XR regimen was part of an ""18-month"" relapse preventive study. It was shown that there was no significant difference in time to regain control after 12 months or so. However, it was suggested that this would be necessary for only 37 p.m. who did not receive imipramin. Another study examined the effects of salivary corticosol concentrations upon improving memory in patients suffering from generalized anxieties. These studies suggest that these disorders are less likely to lead to sudden deterioration than those caused by major depressive disease."
28611377,"Anticoagulation treatment for strokes is recommended for patients with persistent atrial fillation. In patients who are randomed to warfari, time in therapy was similar: 58 versus 57 %), P = 0.051; multivariable adjustment were performed to compare death, bleeding, and mortality between groups, in high risk sub-groups, or across treatment assignment. The absolute risk from early death within 14 days of the initial stroke was low, but there was no advantage to treatment using heparpin. This study examines the clinical correlateof flutter as well as its associated outcomes by matching up 5 AF/ 5 referent's to each case using an nested reference design. An examination about the causes of dead according to da bigatran showed that da Bigaran significantly reduced  Vascular Mortality. relative risk drew a comparison between treatments including cardinal mortality, relative risks p=.007 compared with those without heart disease. A prospective cohort of 23928 patients living in the continental U.S. without coronary chest disease at baseline was studied. Major adverse events were defined as mortal or myocarital infatriate arct icon or stroke. These subjects were divided into two groups: women with acute fibrillation and men with non-abdominal fever. After adjusted for age and others comorbitities, the risk increased in both groups. Atrial Fiilation remains significantly associated with All-Cause Mortal Mortise after multiple independent analysis. It was found that atrium fibriliation was significant in all-caus occurrences. Congestive Heart Failure was regarded as primarily affecting the association between sudden cardiac death and fatality."
28449030,"In this paper, we use hypothetical rand-omized and clustered studies to describe the effects of immunisations on households of two people. The first effect is an unconditional infection, while the second is a community-effect. We examine how effective insecticide-treated bednets have been in terms of protection against cholera in three different countries: India, Bangladesh, and South Korea. This paper also discusses some of the latest developments in the field of social science. For example, it has been reported that there are ""minicommunity designs"" for estimating indirect effects from multiple doses of vaccination."
27888169,"This paper describes the use of a patient-friendly, web-based health management system to improve blood glucose control in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The results are quite different from those seen in other groups: there is no significant difference in blood pressure or body mass index between the two treatment groups; however, both groups have significantly improved their ability to manage blood sugar levels. In addition, they have an improvement in overall gycemic control over time. A1c reductions were not significant for either group. However, we did find that the MycareTeam application was effective in improving general care for older patients who had type 2 disease. We introduced elderly friendly strategies to the Clinical Decisive Support system -- u-Healthcare -- which is an advanced medical information device -- and showed improvements in quality and efficiency as well as cost. All patients received GHb7.0 p.m., had Webaccess from home, and could do so using English language based programs. There were only slight differences in mean HhbA1C or BP level, but total cholesterol levels were significantly lower. At follow up, all patients reported less symptoms of poorly controlled haemologlobin than control subjects and greater satisfaction at their health care."
20088746,"After 6 months of treatment, all patients have increased blood count and erythreocyte cell volume. In addition, the mean pretreatment value for serum cobalmin is 1900 pgm/ml. This suggests that moderate amounts of crystalline capillaric cyanocamin may be as successful in treating food-co balancemin deficitiency. However, two patients only have minor responses to this treatment. The mean concentration of cabalamin after nasal spray was 1900 mogs/mol l1 ; the peak concentration at four months posttreatment was significant with P a.0005. At day 30, there was no sign of anemia. A cross sectional survey was carried out to describe the uses of co balancedmin among  Geriatricians, Hematologists, and General practitioners. Only 25 percent of responders were aware of any RCT describing the efficaciousness of oral co imbalancemin prior to read's synopsis' of the study"
27040323,"The GRADE approach starts as high-quality evidence or observational studies, but they can berated down by risk of bias. In the GRAde approach, trials start as High-Quality evidence and observationals as low-quality evidence; but both can easily be judged down when most of the important evidence comes from study that suffer from ""a high risk for bias."" More recently recognized limitation of observationally studies include failures to conceal allocation, fail to blind, lose to follow up, and failure with appropriately considered the intentions-to-treatment principle. Probiotics seem to reduce mortality in preterm babies with unclear effect upon late-onset enterococci. A double-blindind trial compares probiotic treatment with placebo in preventing necrotizing Enterocotis in infants who are not breast milk fed. There was only one case of Necrotising Enter Occulation among the 34 newborns in the treated group and eight cases among those given control group. This difference is significant at the level of 05 level. It seems that acidic feedings of young premature infant's stomachs may prevent colonizing disease. One prospective doubleblind study evaluates the value of an oral IgG/IgA mixture in inhibiting the incidence ofnectocholitis in neonates of lower birth weight. Infants were divided into four categories by 250 g increments. Mortality increased with higher age groups. Babies were more likely to die from NEC than their mothers' breastmilk. Other risks included very low pregnancy age, respiratory disease, umbiliary artery catheterization, polycythroemia, etc. All these factors were found to be associated with morbidity during the first two weeks of life. These results suggest that there is no need for further intervention."
20379700,"A randomized, placebo-controlled study compared the effects of an exercise program for patients who had been suffering from back pain. The subjects showed no change in their knowledge of the condition at the time of entry and improved their quality of life. In contrast, the control group did not show any improvement in either health or bone mineral density. This was the first study to examine the efficacy of a self-management education program on improving bone health as well as other outcome measures. It was found that this program significantly increased patient's knowledge about the disease. Furthermore, it was also shown that there were no differences between age or score among the two groups. For example, one group gained more knowledge than the other when they were both older. Another study examined the effect of home-based exercises on hip fracture patients. After three months, knee extension strength improved by 12.8 %) in the treatment group versus the controls. There was no significant difference in physical activity scores between the intervention and control groups; however, women with osteoorosis reported greater improvements in overall health."
28616252,"Pilot studies are designed to advance the efficacy or safety of a new treatment or intervention. These studies typically involve two steps: 1) planning and 2) collecting evidence. In pilot studies, it is important to assess the success of the proposed intervention before the main trial. This paper describes the principles of pilots and discusses their importance in the preparation of an RCT. It also provides examples of other pilot-and-feasibility studies that may be used in future trials for multiple sclerical disease."
30045708,"A case series involving 12 patients with unilateral shoulder pain is presented. The results suggest that the presence of taut, tenderness, and pain recognition are highly reliable between treatments. This study uses a checklist to assess the quality of the method logicality of physiotherapy. In this paper, we examine the effects of using trigger point dry-needling as an intervention in post-opportunity pain. Subjects receive greater improvement in pain and function after receiving the treatment than those who receive physical therapy alone. We conclude that migraines are more likely to be associated with the use of trigger points in neck muscles than with headaches."
31760943,"Hamilton et al conclude that the consumption of 30 g per day for 6 weeks may improve blood glucose, lower Leptin levels, and increase Fasting Yiy in healthy overweight subjects without impacting their body composition. In this study, patients with Type 2 diabetes were divided into two groups: one group consumed a daily dose of resistance starch called ham-rs2, and the other group was unable to complete the study because of differences in laboratory results. Mellitus disease was studied in this paper. The effects of resistant starchic on insulin resistance were investigated in type 2 diabetic patients. Although there are no significant changes in fasting or postpranolgial glucose concentrations after the intervention, it is believed that resistancestarch will have some beneficial effect on these patients as well."
24717371,"Iron depletion improves endurance performance in women with elevated steroid-free status, but this effect is not apparent in humans. The results of this study indicate that iron depleted women may be better suited to moderate exercise than those without anemia. This study further establishes the use of iron as a preventative measure for improving iron status in patients with severe iron deficiencies. In this paper, we report on the effects of four weeks of high-dose iron supplementation upon various blood iron levels and metabolic characteristics in female cross- country runners. We conclude that these results are likely due to changes in body composition, physical activity, and diet."
26005199,"In this study, we examine the effects of a 8-week mind-body meditation course on patients with febrianalgy. We find that the treatment results in significant improvements in both pain and quality of life after eight weeks. The main outcome measures are changes in sensitivity to stress and anxiety as well as improvement in physical health at short-term follow-up."
29353323,"In this paper, we describe the effects of stimulant medication, such as methylphini date, on children with hyperactivity disorder. We examine the effect of time on task and inhibitory control, selective attention, and reaction-time variability on math performance. The narrator reports that only change at time is a significant messenger for the efficacious action of MPH. However, it is unclear whether or not this mechanism is involved. A study was conducted in which two groups of children were given different doses of each drug to assess their effects on academic performance: one group received an extended-relieved form of Methhode; the other group had no apparent side effects. All four groups showed marked improvement in symptoms over several weeks. For most of the ADHD symptoms, children in both groups improved significantly than those given intense behavior treatment or community care. Both groups also showed greater improvement when they tested on reading comprehension. They also examined the social effects between boys with and without learning difficulties. These results suggest that ""comfortatory improvements"" in executive function are associated with better clinical outcome."
27473099,"The incidence of road traffic injury is 16 per 1000 people, household injuries are 57 per 1,000 persons and injury at placeof work is 19 per thousand persons. A population-based cohort studies were done to estimated the incidence for different types of accidents and to evaluate specific risk factors in An urban squalid city in India. This study had identified groups who were at higher risk for injuries; they may need specific protection measures. In addition, the relative risk of men to females was 3.03 and for household injured was 0.39. These studies have identified certain groups of people whom are at high risks for incidents and who may require specific protective measures: ""The relativerisk of malesto women for traffic injurieswas 3.04 and from household wounds it was 0.3"""
26739716,"In this paper, Holmwood focuses on the problems of reward systems in medical practice. He uses a logistic regression analysis to predict whether psychological factors are associated with pain or disability in acute and subacute patients with low back pain. The results suggest that fear-awareness beliefs are more strongly related to persistent pain than shoulder pain; however, it is not clear whether these factors also contribute to long-term pain recovery. A prospective cohort study has been conducted to assess the effect of physical activity on neck pain in patients who have had an acute episode of their injury. Neck pain is treated with mobilization but does not improve over time."
29318741,"This study consists of two parts: 1) an investigation of the effects of magnificent loupes to improve students' posture during their first three months of school; and 2) a second, more controlled study on pain in dental college students. In this paper, we examine the relationship between work-related factors and pain among dentists and other health care professionals. We find that patients with neck pain are more likely to suffer from pain when they sit for more than nine hours per day. Furthermore, studies have shown that wearing magnifying glasses can improve patient posture."
23236190,"In this study, the effects of a series of short-term physical and ointment treatments on knee pain are compared. The results suggest that these treatments are more effective than conventional approaches in relieving pain. A group consisting of 50 patients with knee OsteoArtisms is divided into 2 groups: one group receives mud baths and the other follows an all-over regimen of exercises. After two weeks, no significant improvement is seen in pain scores. This study determines whether spa therapy can be used as an alternative to medical treatment for knee osteoarthria. It was found that both methods were highly efficacious at improving symptoms."
22575611,"In this study, we examine the effects of morphine on bipolar patients who have recently experienced an episode of depression. The results suggest that a form of treatment called ""long-lasting gab"" may be more effective than conventional treatments for treating mood disorders. We conclude that divalpropex is superior to placebo in prolonging time to regain consciousness in patients suffering from bipole I disorder. A double blinded, placebo-control trial was conducted to determine the efficaciousness and tolerableness of lamotripine and lithium as antidepressants in newly manic or epiphany patients with biphosphorus disease. This paper represents the first attempt to assess the effectiveness and safest combination of two different drugs for the treatment of Bipolar I/Bipolar II disorder; it shows no significant between- group differences when any pair were compared upon the primary outcome measures. It also shows that there are no cases of alteration in either arm during follow-up periods. Although some patients do not respond well to these regimens, they show improvement in depressed symptoms over time. Long-term studies are needed to find out how effective maintenance therapy can be. There are few studies comparing the benefits of long- term treatment with standard treatment."
30113661,"In this study, we examine the effect of probiotic consumption on serum lipids in type II patients. Consumption is associated with improved blood pressure, reduced hepatitic fat accumulation, and improved liver function. The results are similar to those seen in other studies. Type 2 diabetes is one of the most common forms of chronic liver diseases in the world. Nonalcoholicfatty liver disease has been suggested as well to be well-correlated with alteredblood pressure. This study was conducted among 60 patients aged 25to64 years old who were treated according to histology. They were divided into three groups: 1) control group; 2) intervention group only; and 3) placebo group. Both groups showed significant changes in their body mass index, waist circumferentiality, glucose and lipoprotein concentrations. Probiotic treatment did not lead to any change in these parameters. Obesesity is related to a great variety of diseases including no-alcoholic flint disease. Fecalmicrobiota transplantation has evolved from case reports in medical literature tothe basis of Major innovations in treating Clostridial difficile infection or, potentially, inflammatorybowel disease. FMT was noticed to significantly lower risk factors and/or liver enzymes for patients with non-alcohol-induced liver damage. After 5 days they showed reductions of cholesterol levels and normal liver functions. Aim The present study suggest that some proicrobial compounds may have beneficial affects upon sonographic and Biochemical nonalcoholic fistificial disease"
30511328,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of diet and physical exercise on patients with Type 2 diabetes. Although all patients show good compliance with the regimen, there are some side-effectations. The aim of the study is to investigate whether metformine-based treatment can benefit weight loss in obese children who are insulin resistant. All patients have normal linear growth for age, with no marks hirsusm, severe acne or menstruals irregularities characteristicof polycystistic oathiness. This study also examines the effect of an eating minimeal on body weight. After one week, each patient receives 500 milligrams per day; after two weeks, they are assigned to either lifestyle intervention or placebo as well as an antihyptertensive medicine. There is no difference in any of these adverse events except for ""0.785"" which is due to the fact that both groups had different blood pressures. However, their changes were not significant enough to be considered efficacious. A further paper describes the use of metformedin in treating overweight patients without type 2 disease."
17595425,"In this study, we examine the performance of the Striatafy fall risk assessment tool on patients recovering from an acute stroke. The results suggest that a multiple intervention approach to prevent falls is effective in reducing the number of patients who fall after their stay in the hospital. A significant difference was significant between the Peto log-rank test and the confidence interval for the prediction of falls among patients with high risk factors. Although the identification system did not predict who would fall, it was more accurate than other methods. This paper also discusses the efficacy of several different approaches to predicting falls: 1) use of pre-existing disease as predictors; 2) useof outcome measures such as patient's age, gender, and severity of injury; and 3) use ""predictive validity"" by correlating medical scores with barthel scores. However, these studies do not have any specificity or predictive power in relation to falling or discharge."
23324965,"In this study, Wuthering Heights demonstrates that the cementless cup is superior to the cemented cup in terms of long-term survival. After two and five years, the results of total hip replacement are reported. The patients with loosening or infection underwent revision after 15 years because of looseness of the aecdote's attachment to their bone. This was one of first studies in using cement as an adjuvant to total knee arthroscopic surgery. It showed improved overall survival rates for both types of devices."
23771266,"In this study, Wuthering Heights demonstrates that thermic therapy can be used to treat a variety of inflammatory and debilitating conditions. The patients receive two different types of treatment: mud baths and heat packs. Both groups show significant improvement in pain and tender point scores. Wuthringkörper is an important disease for which there are many anti-inflammation drugs."
25442969,"In this paper, Wiley and Sons examine the relationship between close friendships and health traits. They find that there are more likely ties to dissolve between individuals with different health characteristics than among those with similar ones. We develop new mixed effects modeling to explore the role of these traits on the social status of people in the Heart Study. This study uses a combination of laboratory experiments and observational methods to investigate the influence of social networks on cooperative behavior. The results suggest that human social relationships are highly cooperative and organized. People can respond by breaking or making network links. Social networks often lead to changes in how people behave toward one another. For example, when two people share food, they tend to give more to each other than others who have different social connections. These shifts in behavior also affect the distribution of disease risk across communities."
29508661,"In this study, we report the results of two patients who have had a significant increase in their knee prosthesis after four years. They are both treated with an ostificial cement and they show no differences in migrating during the first three years of follow-up. The cement is more effective than the conventional bone cement because it has less liftoff and can be uncoupled to improve fixation. After two years, however, the cement fails to perform as expected."
25162440,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of initial percutaneous draining in patients with acutely ill abscessed left colon. This was performed in a prospective, ie, open-label fashion. Although there were no major complications during the procedure, superficial wound infections were more frequently encountered than deep wound infection. In addition, laparoscopic drainage was associated with greater morbidity when compared to immediate appendectomy. Furthermore, it was found that conservative treatment with antibiotics did not lead to significant increases in the risk of anatomotic scars."
29359958,"The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of reveratrol in patients with Type 2 Diabetes mellitateus. In this doubleblind, randomed, placebo controlled trial, 50 patients were randomized to either a 100-mg capsule of total reasveratel or one tablet daily for 12 week treatment. This was an effective and well-to-do intervention for type 2 diabetes. It showed that it improved bone mineral density in subjects with mets. Furthermore, it did not improve blood pressure or insulinsensitivity."
31521554,"In people with mild-to-moderately severe disease, exercise is not sufficient to prevent falls. A randomized, double-blind, cross-sectional study demonstrates that home-based exercises are not as effective as a supervised exercise regimen for improving gait and balance in patients with moderate-severe disease. The results of this trial suggest that the use of teleretraining may be cost-effective when compared to other forms of treatment. This paper reports on the effectiveness of two different types of fall prevention: 1) an eight-week home program; and 2) omished control groups. It concludes that there is no significant difference in the risk of falls between the two groups but that they do not result in significant changes in quality of life."
23958262,"In this study, we investigate the effects of adenosine-diphosphorylated TZD on blood concentrations of Ccaat and Sreb1c, respectively. After 12 weeks, fasting plasma glucose decreases in the diabetous group but is unchanged in lean and overweight subjects. The results of this trial are reported to be similar to those of other studies. Adipogenin levels are elevated immediately following exercise at both intensities. Both drugs improve HDL-cholestrol levels; however, they do not reduce the primary endpoint of coronary disease. Furthermore, these results suggest that high trigllycerides may be associated with reduced risk of fatal myomycardial infarction or sudden death."
31860103,"In this study, we examine the effects of four-months of daily vitamin D on hip fractures in patients with a low 25-hydroxyvindal concentration. The results suggest that it is not sufficient for an adequate amount of treatment to prevent these injuries among elderly people living in institutions. A double blind trial has been conducted in older people who live in their own homes or care homes and finds no significant effect on fracture risk. This paper also discusses the use of ergocaliferol as an anti-fracture therapy. It was found that both groups received significantly higher doses than placebo but that there was no association between the levels of 25HhD and fracture risks. Furthermore, studies have shown that high-dose Vitamin D may reduce the rate of fall and falls in healthy post menopausals. These studies are supported by the fact that they do not result in all type of cancer at any age. However, some evidence suggests that increased serum 25 HOHD increases the risk of falling and breaks in elderly persons. We conclude that such regimens cannot be expected to reduce bone mineral loss in those aged over 70 years."
15289592,Back pain is an epidemic in the U.S. and many studies have tried to find a way to treat it. One study has found that back bracing can be used to prevent back pain from getting worse. Another study finds no evidence that using lumbar support can reduce low back injury. A second study suggests that frequent back-stuff use may be associated with reduced risk of back injuries.
24855158,"In this paper, we describe the use of a real-time, automated patient-centered communication system to improve blood glucose control in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The goal of the study is to determine whether an intervention can be used to increase health and quality of lives by improving self-management and behavior. We conclude that the ""cal"" or ""cued-net"" program is as effective as traditional education in providing support, information, and education but is more likely to encourage people to manage their blood sugar levels. This paper reports on the effectiveness of two different types of treatment for type 2 patients: 1) brief intervention using cell phones and the web; and 2) moderately-informed care using phone calls and tablet technology. Although there are differences in results between groups, these changes do not translate into improved biological outcomes. A second study compares the efficaciousness of three different approaches to treating overweight patients who have both Type 1 and hypertension. These studies focus on how best to address the gap between the American Diabetes Association's recommended services and those received by patients outside of primary care."
29943231,"In this study, the incidence and association of injuries among international rowers was described. The injury severity was significantly higher than that of individual sports: 6.16 injuries/1000 hours vs. 2.88 injuries per 1000 hour over the 12 month period. This study is followed up by a follow-up cohort study in which all players were recruited from an American public school for two years. Athletic injuries were recorded by medical staff using standardized questionnaires during the first year of the study. A total of 113 injuries occurred at the beginning of each season. All players had been involved in multiple matches within the previous twelve months. There was no significant increase in subsequent injury rates for high match fastbowling loads in the short term. Majority of these injuries are due to excessive training volume. Furthermore, there was little relationship between previous injury history and injury risk. However, several studies have suggested that young elite baseball players may be at greater risk because of their past injuries. These studies also suggest that running with more intense training load increases injury risks."
29596560,"In this double blinded, prospective study, we examine the efficacy and safety of medical hypnotism on wound healing in patients undergoing elective surgical wounds. The results indicate that stressors do not influence skin barrier recovery but rather delay it. A brief laboratory-based stress reliever does not improve wound health. This study is designed to evaluate the effect of an emphasic patient-centred approach on preoperative anxiety and surgical outcome in a large ambulatory practice population. After the patient center intervention, the patients showed lower levelsof preoperative anxiety, pain, and improvement in daily activity than the control group. Concluusions Mild post-surgery hypotheasies are associated with infection; one physician blindly to patient hypothia gathered the raw data from two hundred surgical patients. We investigated whether warming patients before surgery seemed to reduce wound infection. No patients were wounded during the study. However, no patients developed kelodies afterward."
22723585,"In this study, Wu et al.1 examined the relationship between circulating glucose and blood concentrations of several different endogenous chemicals in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that a high-choleraosteal concentration is associated with an excess risk of western-related diseases during adulthood."
26420387,"In this paper, the effects of a diet high in phosphorus and calcium on fractures are examined. The risk of fracture is reduced when women consume more than three-quarters of their daily allowance of calcium. This study also examines the association between bone mineral density and fracture risk among older women. Women with low bone mass or poor physical activity tend to have greater risk for fracture because they are more likely to be depressed about their health. A large population of elderly men and women live in southern California where there is no evidence of hip fracture. Although these studies do not directly relate to fracture risks, they suggest that consumption of dairy, alcohol, and vitamin D may help prevent fracture from occurring."
27416628,"In this study, we examine the effect of a daily fish oil supplement on infants at risk of developing an allergic disease. We conclude that prenatal fish oils do not prevent childhood asthma or sensitization; however, they do improve infant n--3 status and reduce the frequency of symptoms in children with sensitive parents. Atopy, respiratory infection, impulse Ossometry, and exhamed nicotric oxide were also reported. Pregnatal antigens may influence immune function and the risk for allergic diseases. Antigen avoidance during pregnancy may reduce maternal fetal immunity but have not yet been studied. The relationship between food allergy and skin sensitivity remains unrecognized. Probiotics are more effective in preventing these problems than placebos. However, there is no association between length of exclusive breast feeding and development of susceptibility toward asthma."
25767138,"In this study, Wuthering Heights demonstrates that strength training is superior to traditional pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with moderate to severely obliterated lungs. He concludes that resistance training may be more effective in the treatment of patients who have a severe relapsing disease."
25431555,"This is a pilot study designed to evaluate the effects of two different types of brainfeedback on children with ADHD. The first group consisted of EEG training and the second was sham, which resulted in improved symptoms for both groups. Children were assigned to either treatment group according to their age, severity, and whether they had any other coexisting medical conditions. After six months, the results showed that the neurofeet-training group made more prompt improvements than the control group. Six months after the intervention, however, there was still no significant change in medication. A double blind, placebo-control study was conducted to assess the effect of electrodervalous electroencephalography on patients with attention deficit or hyperactivity disorder. In this study, ninety one children and adults were successfully randomed by age range, intelligence, size, gender, etc. No significant differences were observed between the treatment treatments. However, it was found that while total ADHD symptoms did improve over time in each group, neither group had significant side effects. Parents reported significant changes in their children's behavior before and after receiving treatment, but no additional value was observed for neurofeedboarding over TAU."
30854594,"Probiotics have a beneficial effect on blood lipid levels, but they are not as effective in treating patients with Type 2 diabetes. A doubleblind, randomized, placebo controlled trial was performed in the acute care unit of an tertyary care teaching institution. The results showed that probiotic treatment improved both systemic and sub-systemic immune function. In addition, it did not lead to any changes in other disease-related outcomes. This study examined the effects of multi-species probiota on glcemic control or other diseases in people who had type 2 Diabetes. They found that Lactobacilus reduces inflammation by increasing the secretion of TNF-A and IL-16 in subjects with ulcerative Colitis. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate that the immunemodulatory effects may extend to the systemsic nervous system. These studies also show that antigens can be inhibited by gut defense mechanisms. There is no significant difference between the mean values of serum IgG and HgL at day 1 and afterward. However, there is some improvement in overall quality of life for patients receiving probotics."
27405704,"This is a first-in-man, long-term study of the effects of genetic risk testing on patients with type 2 disease. The results of this study suggest that adding genetic information to risk models does not improve discriminability and only modest improvement in calibration can be obtained when added to both the Cambridge and Framingham risk scores. In addition, there are no significant differences in anxiety, fat intake, or exercise at long term following-up. After eight weeks, the follow-on analysis indicates that it is likely that providing more accurate risk information will lead to improved health behavior. A second study has been conducted to assess the impact of using genetic test results to prevent or reduce weight gain. It was found that people who had higher levels of risk were less likely to change their lifestyles after receiving such advice."
25985235,"In this paper, the first two studies of a prospective, open-label, random-distribution study are presented. The first is an observational study of 16 boys with attention-deprived hyperactivity disorder who receive carnisoline over one year. After treatment, home behavior improves significantly in the majority of girls. A second study is designed to determine safety and efficacy for carnictine in children with ADHD. This study uses parents' child-behavior checklist and teachers' conners test as controls. It does not show any significant effect on patients with symptoms of anxiety or sensitivity. However, it does show some improvement in social behavior among patients treated with lac."
32382836,"In this paper, the authors describe the results of a controlled trial in which 100 patients were treated with either anopexes or diamiry excision. The outcome was that the patient's pain scores improved significantly after either treatment. A multicentre open-heartoid surgical trial was conducted to determine the role of more extensive mucousal reassuring in patients with stage III haemorrhoids under stapled haerrhaodopeexy. This study was designed to establish the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of single-handedly embolized haenmorrhumoidal disease as first-line surgery. It was found that both methods had similar efficacy at the end of the follow-up period. After two years, there was no significant differences between terms of postopérative pain, expected painand analgesis requirements; but more than one type of intervention did have similar success. For example, ""thirty-year-old"" patients who failed conventional treatment were assigned to Thad or Sh. Over the next 12 months, blood scores were calculated for pain and quality-of- life. There was little difference in the severity of symptoms during the initial six weeks of observation."
24392600,"In this study, we examine the association between psychological and social-envirmental factors and type 2 diabetes control. We find that only diet contributes to the explained variance in blood-glucose concentration among all three of these variables. The results suggest that a six month intervention with telemedicine can be used to improve both physical and mental health in African American adults with Type 2 who have elevated body mass index. This treatment is more effective than usual care for improving blood glucose levels."
25142703,"The aim of this study is to determine whether the use of hypnosis can improve fatigue in patients with breastcancer. It was found that there was a significant improvement in sleepiness and fatigue among patients treated with CPAP, but no significant change in other symptoms. Brain Snack: Many people have complaints of fatigue after breast cancer treatment. For example, executive function complaints are frequently associated with better performance on the National Psychiatry. In addition, depression and anxiety seem to be more common after combined chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment than before. Post-treatment studies examine whether an intervention for insomnia can reduce fatigue or not. A pilot study compares effects of CBTI relative to waitlist control in women who were newly diagnoseed with stage-purpose fatigue. This study concludes that light exposure during morning bright light will result in less pain in men and women suffering from breastcarrying."
29856237,"In this study, we examine the efficacy of a patient-centered, nurse-led intervention to improve blood pressure and lipoprotein levels after stroke. We conclude that it is more effective than usual care for improving sytolic bp and LDLc levels at three and six months after hospitalization in patients with acute stroke or severe ischemia. The results suggest that an organized secondary preventive program may be more successful than standard care in improving these outcomes. A pooled analysis of follow-up measures indicates that the intervention group has better scores on functional status, depression, self-efficacy, and diet adherence than control groups. Although there was no significant differences among the two groups when they were entry to study; at 3 and 6, mos after Stroke/transient Ischaemic attacks, the treatment group showed better score than the control band in Functional Status, Depression, Self-Perceived Well-Being,and Pedringano's Complication Score. This study also reports that smoking cessations have been shown to be superior to regimented routine rehabilitation by comparison with other studies. It shows that ""companionship postdischarity care management"" can be improved by enhanced discharge planning."
32201245,"In this paper, we examine the effect of a single dose of N. Sativa on blood pressure, heart rate, and body mass in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that Nigella Sativea may be an effective treatment for type 2 disease."
25828270,"The effect of a five-year fenobrate treatment on blood pressure, lipids, and other risk factors in subjects with severe hypotriglycemia was studied in the Fenofisibate Intervention and Event Lowing in Diabetes trial. In this study, bezafied 200mg twice daily reduces plasma levels of all three major riskfactors: fibrinogen, pachi-1, factor VII, etc. Furthermore, it does not improve any of the other measures of inflammation or haemostaty function. This study is an International Stand and Ard R and Omized Controlled Trial number N6478304. A large cohort of type 2 patients with Type 1 diabetes were included in this crossover study. They had previous cardiovascular disease, microvascular diseases, previous nontraumatic apothecary injury, smoking, longer duration of their disease than those who had no event. All 9796 patients were completed the study; eighty-five patients and all controls subjects complete the experiment. The objective of these studies was to compare short-term treatments with theAmerican Heart Association's Step 1 diet on systemsic inflammation, bleeding, monocyte secretoriy functions in relation to their metabolic actions. These studies were performed in 92 patients from age 58 to 55 years old. After adjustmentfor age and sensitivity, an idealCVH score was associated with elevated carotide intimamedia thickness orstenosity, left vexed hypertrophy by echocardiography,left ventricular spitting dysfunction,microalbuminurius, reduced ankle brachial index. It was concluded that the combination of simvastain and finofibatrate did not reduce fatal cardiovascular events as compared either alone. However, there were no significant differences among the two groups regarding any secondary outcome. There were only minor differences between the group with respect to anything secondary"
31483070,"After 12 weeks, all groups improve in Oab symptoms and quality-of-life. In the first group, patients were divided into three groups: GI -- 30 min TENS; twice a weekly; GIII -- daily slow release Ten mg oxyButynin; and GIV -- 10-25mg Solifenacin. All groups improved in Urinary Digest Scores after treatment. The results of this study indicate that combination therapy has better efficacincy than tolterordine alone or combined as an overactive urinary disorder. A prospective single- blinded multi-centre trial was performed with 182 patients who received either placebo, WLT, tollerodiner, or WTT plus totterodin. To evaluate whether solifeccain 5m combined with miraculin 25 or 50m would be more effective in treating over active bladder, five of six combinations reduced urgency episodes significantly than so lifenacinate 5mm. This study compares percutaneous nerve stimulation with electrical stimulation in women with excessive bladder disease. These studies are published in the journal of the American Society of Urology."
25354945,"In this study, healthy males consume a semisolid meal with 1,000mg of acetamineophen in one session. The results show that the amount of milk consumed is not different from the amounts consumed by other patients. A cross-over trial was conducted in 15 healthy men and showed no difference in the time to empty gastric contents after tea or without milk. This study also examined the effect of calorific content on the rate at which stomach emptying was performed. It was found that there was an ""at-risk stomach"" in some patients but it was not observed in others. An attempt was made to use stand and ardificial ultrasound to assess gascular volume in healthy subjects."
22525963,"Estradiol is associated with a reduction in corticogenopin-releasing Hormone levels after ooporectomy, but no relation between age and the response of hypothalamotic-pituital-adresal. A cross sectional study was performed of 1423 women from the community who had not undergone any type of steroid treatment before or after their menopause. The results suggest that some menstrual/reproductive factors may affect endogenously sexhormones in the premenopalous period; while age,  Oophorectomy history, and naivete use may be association with selected rogen concentrations. In postmanopardy women, however, there is no association between estradiolil and testosterone. Transdermal testosterone increases sexual function and mental well-being. There is an increase in frequency of sexual activities and pleasure-occultism among females who have underwent bifidectomy. Women who are not taking estrogen at baseline show increased hip fractures than those who do not take it. This study determines whether the relationship between total testosterone and Igf-binding Protein is independent of other risk factors."
29760253,"Twenty-four patients with insomnia who have been using benzodiazingpines for at least five weeks participate in a double blind, controlled trial. The results of the study suggest that substituting zepiclone as an opium substitute is superior to placebo in improving sleep quality. In this study, we examine the effect of switching patients from ""previous"" hypnotism to zOpicLone on long-term effects of cesarean drug use. A mixed-effects model was used to predict the relative risk and severity of clinical depression among those who reported their insomnia in medical schools. This study concludes that adding group CBT does not increase the successful discontinuation of long term psychiapatric treatment. However, it does lead to improvements in sleep efficiency when compared with continuing control groups. Furthermore, there are no significant changes in wake time during withdrawal. These results suggest further potential applications for such sedatives."
26055921,"The results of this study suggest that adjunctive l-metalfolate treatment may be an effective, safe, and relatively well tolerated regimen for patients with Major Depressive disorder. In addition, it has been shown that folate is more effective in treating depressed patients than other antidepressants."
29238651,"A long-term, open-label study comparing the efficaciousness of two different anxiety-fighting drugs in patients with primary or secondary panic disorder. The mean doses for both treatments were 1.9mg/d and 38.4, respectively. Both treatment also reduced the numberof panic attacks and severe anxiety. In addition, they improved the severity of anxiety over the long term. This was followed by a longer trial of paroxenetine and clonalzepam. Although these two drugs are more effective than other antipsychotics, there is little evidence that they can be used as anaugmentation strategy for patients who have failed to respond well to initial morphine therapy."
23650680,"A case-controlled study of ovarian cancer was conducted between October 1978 to February 1983 in London and Oswald's laboratory. The risk of developing a second-line disease was reduced when women were treated with high gravidities, female stewardship, and contraceptives. In contrast, the risk for developing an advanced disease increased when menstrual characteristics were associated with higher risk. After follow-up, two patients became progressive disease, including one who died. This study describes the surgical treatment of patients with epithelially ovarian lesions with laparotopy. All patients received salvage therapy except those with stage III and IV tumors. There was no difference in the cumulative pregnancy rates among groups. Two different regimens were available for patients suffering from recurrent or metastatic disease. One patient had complete curative surgery followed by nonconservative treatments. Another trial was performed to evaluate the effects of both bevacicizumab plus metronomic Orchard Cyclophosphaide on rescorts with early birth. It was found that this strategy was more effective than other methods for treating young women with recurring oligomenomas."
18843651,"In this study, the effects of different antihypersive regimens on blood pressure are compared in subjects with mild to moderate essential-hypertension. The results show that quinopril is more effective than placebo in preventing coughing and other side-effects. A double blinded, parallel- group study compares the efficaciousness of two different drugs: angioten'sin-converting enzyme inhibitor Quinaprile and an anthroptic antagonist bosentan. Both regimen achieve similar decreases in resting chest rate and blood flow. All three treatments produce significant changes in sitting diatolic bloodpressure. These results suggest that penicillin is useful for treating mildly to moderate essential hypotension; however, it does not seem to have any beneficial effect on patients with severe hypertension or Type 2 diabetes."
28093732,"In this paper, the effects of a continuous regimen of estrogen and prostagminode therapy on postmenopalasal women are examined. The results indicate that there is little or no risk of stroke in those treated with either treatment. Women who have had an initial hematomism before menopause receive more than one year of progestine alone; however, they do not experience any changes in their mammography or other symptoms. After two years, breast cancer is almost completely eliminated in the combined estrogen plusprogestion group. This study also provides evidence for the use of conjugated-equine Estrogen to reduce fracture risk among postmanopausals. It also suggests that long-term uses of coriolanin may be associated with reduced risks from stroke."
10789614,"In this study, we examine the effects of colloidal bimuth subcurrate on patients with acute H. prilori infection. We conclude that it is more likely for patients to report noxturnal pain, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting than those who take placebo. A double blind placebo-controlled study assesses the efficacy of colloid bismutha subcitate, ampicillin, combined with metirondazole in treating Heliobacter Pyloris in nonulcer Dyspeasia. The results indicate that treatment with collolidial bismunih Subcitrate leads to improved symptoms in patients without ulcer disease. This study also confirms that tricyclic Bismuthus subcipitate does not usually cure Helicophag pyori; however, it has been reported that there is a significant role for this organism in gastric ulcers."
17720798,"Forty patients with activity-restrained shoulder pain are enrolled in this study. They perform the repressed supination internal rotation test, which has the highestsensitivity, specificity, and positive prediction value of 82.8 %) and negative predictive value 92.3 p.a., as well as diagnostic accuracy 82.5 pp. This study is designed to compare the results of two commonly used tests for diagnosis of superior labral posterior tears: the crank test and the O1Brien test. The results suggest that these tests are not sensitive clinical indications for glenonehumeral injuries. A prospective study was conducted on 65 patients who have symptoms of shoulders. Fifty five of 62 had pain in their acromolioclavic joint; fifty-five were treated with arthroscopies or magnetic resonance imaging. These patients also served as controls. In this paper, we describe the use of the ""Anterior Slide test"" for diagnosing anterior shoulder instability. We conclude that the test is accurate because it can be used to diagnose inferior laboratoryral tears in overhead throwing athletes."
26104189,"In this paper, we examine the efficacy and safety of a self-monitory weight loss intervention based on real-time activity feedback. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support moderate intensity physical exercise as an effective strategy for weight management. A single-centre, standard-controlled trial was conducted in Bedfordshire, United Kingdom with 77 adults aged between 40.4 and 76.1 years. The main outcomes were accelerometer measurements and self report of physical activity. After three months, completers received both the human e mail counseling and the auto-tracked Feedback groups. At 3 month's time, completeers in both group had greater weight losses than the control group; these groups do not differ either from each other. This study uses Go4Life education to determine whether providing an accelerometer with feedback about activities and counseling older people would increase activity level. No significant change in body fat was observed after the intervention. However, no significant difference was seen in the health status of the two groups at follow-up. There was no major difference in any sub-sections in whichthe intervention affected physical behavior or activity levels. Over the next course of studies, several different groups were recruited. Each group received one of three types of technology: 1) basic self monitoring with basic feedback; 2) enhanced behavioral feedback/wait-list control; or wait-listed control. Results showed that the technology needed to be used continually throughout the intervening period to greatly impact weight Loss."
18751709,"A randomized, controlled trial is presented to determine the effect of an exercise program and patient education combined with talasso therapy on patients with Fibromyalsgia. After three months, physical health seems to be improving in the treatment-only group but not after six and 12 months. The results are similar to those reported in other studies. In this study, 48 people who had been treated with 15 different types of connective tissue treatments showed pain relief and improved quality of life. However, further studies must be performed to understand the mechanism behind these effects"
25806470,"The risk of a pacemaker being inserted in women with atrial fibrillation is increased when the dose of aspirin is used. Women have more frequent and serious heart symptoms than men, but their physical health improves from baseline to three months. In contrast, men have worse mental health than women. A prospective registry of patients hospitalized for acute myelogia in Qatar has been performed. All patients were treated with warfarin except for two patients who had severe strokes. Warfin use was also associated with lower adjusted Thromboembolis rates for both genders; however, there was no difference in the quality of treatment. Strokery was common in both groups. There was an increase in major bleeding among females with AF. This study determines whether women are at greater risk for stroke due to blood transfusion. Although this study does not directly relate to stroke, it does suggest that women may be at higher risk because of their longer duration of illness."
19748548,"In this paper, we describe a 5-year-long study of the safety of two different types of sealants: high-visosity glass ionicomer sealant and light-cured resin-based restorative materials. The results indicate that the latter has fewer risks of caries than the other two, with sensitivity at least four times higher in the first three years. A comparison between the two materials is made. Four conventional cements are used for the traumatic restourative treatment; however, they do not show any significant differences in their efficacy as compared to the more commonly used ""art"" or ""resealable"" material. They also have no significant difference in fluoride resistance when used as part of an ostinectomy."
29406457,"The aim of this study is to investigate whether the use of splints, which are frequently used in patients with knee pain, can be used to restore range of motion after total kneearthroplasty. Osteoarthritis is more common in men and women than in other diseases. In addition, the incidence of intrinsic varus is higher in males than females. Furthermore, there is a significant difference in the frequency of inherent varums among different age groups. A mean Hka angle of 174.9 o'clock was similar to that of the Oxford knee replacement performed between July 2004, and December 2006. This prospective study includes 78 Oxford unicomparmental knee-replacements in 69 patients. At the two year follow-up, they achieved an Oxford Knee score of 38.3. There are many surgical options for patients who have knee problems, but it is difficult to decide what type of surgery is appropriate."
29681480,"The results of this prospective study indicate that the use of a retrograde root-end sealer, MTA, leads to higher healing rates than Com in the long term. A total population of 271 single-rooted tooth can be reexamined for follow-up after 5 years. In contrast, only 1 failure is seen when using IRM as an endodontic sealant. This paper also discusses the effect of pain at initial exam and other signs or symptoms during surgery. After one year, all patients are divided into three groups: success, uncertain healing, and failure. For example, teeth treated with Retroplast were found to heal better than those treated by either material."
25076495,"In this study, we systematically follow 58,0663 women in the United States without Type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease. We found that higher walnuts were associated with lower risks of type 2 and reduced Hba1c by nearly two-fold when compared to the American Diabetes Association's standard diet. The LCM diet was superior to either the ADA or the Tommo method in improving blood lipid levels. Furthermore, the reduction in HdL was significantly greater than the control diet for both improved glyceric control and improved insulin sensitivity. A cross-sectional study comparing four different diets in thirty-two volunteers showed that one high-fat, high almond, low fat, and high palm oil diet improved HDL while the other had no significant effect on total cholesterol. This study also examined the effects of nuts on endometrial function in type 2, diabetic patients. After 8 weeks, participants were assigned to any of the three groups: 1) acontrol diet; 2) an enriched almond-enriched meal; and 3) tidbits from coconuts. These results suggest that consumption of these nuts may be beneficial in reducing the risk of developing Type 1 or Type 2-disease."
28785411,"In this paper, the effects of intense training on triathlon-tenders are compared. The results indicate that there is a significant increase in the free testosterone tocortisol and glutamine ratio after six weeks of overtraining. Athletics with varying levels of recovery from previous bouts of heavy training show signs of ""overreaching"" in these two groups. One group completes six weekly of normal training while the other is deliberately overexhausted through intensifying training. Athletic performance changes are measured by the multistage fitness test as well as an assessment of mood states. Twenty-eight semi-pro Rugby League players were assigned into two pairs matched groups; eighteen male endurance athletes were invited to both groups for comparison. All 18 men showed remarkably marked decreases in their performance during the first month of the experiment. This study was used to determine whether NFO or Overtrained athlete's performance was influenced by resting and/or exercise-induced changes in cortinsol, lutenizing Hormone, and growth Hormonium. These changes were not observed in either group. However, they were found to be associated with reduced response time, reaction time capacity, body mass, strength, etc."
22387009,"The results of the pre-tests show that the Least Severity Pedring group has more favorable changes in blood pressure, body mass, and body composition than the other two groups. In addition, the pedring program improves fat free mass by increasing the amount of time it takes to train. A further study is needed to determine the effects of exercise training on lean muscle Mass, Body Mass Index, Fitness, Resting Heart, Systelic Blood Pressure and Lipid Profiles in Obeyed Children. This study uses a Delphi round to collect information about the quality of trials used in this study. It shows that both groups have improved their health and reduced their risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes."
10796152,"In this paper, we report on the safety and efficacy of a combination of pre- and post-pregnative treatment of mothers with iodinated oil during their pregnancy. We examine the effects of this treatment on newborns and conclude that it is safe for pregnant women to use it."
26897342,"This paper focuses on the effects of an intervention to reduce childhood obesity in girls and boys. In this study, parents reported reduced screen time, increased fruit and vegetables consumption, and increased physical activity among girls. A culturally-tailored after- school dance and screentime reduction intervention for poor-educated African American girls does not significantly reduce body mass index as compared with other measures of health education. However, it produces potentially clinically important changes in lipoprotein levels, hyperininemia, depressive symptoms, or total energy consumption. The results of this trial suggest that a schoolbased intervention can prevent excessive weight gain and improve eating habits at homes."
21438991,"Gastric bypass has a better weight loss than gastric partition, but the complications are more serious. A prospective study compares the efficacy and safety of two different types of surgery for patients with severe obesity. The first type is laparoscopic adjustmentable gastroplasty, while the second is vertical b-and-ed Gastrostomy. Both procedures result in significant reductions in body weight and improvement in health. However, there are some drawbacks to the newer technique because it involves longer hospital stay and greater risk of complications."
26882490,"In this study, we report that percutaneous penile reection improves in patients with non-ned spinal cord injuries. We conclude that the use of intracaversal needles and prostagl in these patients has improved their erectility. This is significant because it leads to an improvement in latent period. Furthermore, there is no side effect or other complications from the treatment. The efficacy of Sildenanafil was found to be superior to placebo in terms of improving oestrical function."
20012073,"The mean proxital (+)/distal stem of the uncemented knee is -0.14) mm at three months follow-up. In this group, there are no complications after surgery; however, full weight bearing does not affect the migration pattern. After two years, the average load on the leg is 39.0 g for the Uwb and 25.08 for PWB. Both groups have no significant differences in the rate of assication during walking. Aiming to improve muscle strength after total hiparthroplasty, Wollstonecraft suggests that patients should be given more time to rest and recover before the operation."
30088015,"In this single-arm, idiligence study, we examine the safety and efficacy in Japanese patients who are at risk for stroke. We conclude that aspirin may be superior to other anticoagulant regimens because of its lower risk of fatal complications. The primary point of the study is to determine whether three-leaf screening improves detection of atrium fibrillation. This trial was stopped early because there were 26 primary endpoint events: 3.1 %) per year; 95 p. CI / 2.1 0% to 4.7 % Per year. A total of four26 patients were treated to aspidin group or without antiplatelets or antithropper therapy. Methods Patients with natrifican atrial fibrillation were randomed to an aspriin band or control group without any treatment. Metamorphisms Atrial fibrilation is common in elderly people and a commonly cause of Embolic Stroke. There are no significant differences between stroke risk profiles among patients detected through obportunistic or systematic approaches. However, rates of rate control are not inferior to those of strict rate controls."
32216045,"The effects of water and N-sucrose sweeteners on body weight were not equivalent to weight loss during a year-long behavior treatment program. In contrast, drinking sucrose added directly to the diet did not lead to significant weight reduction. However, this was true for overweight women who consumed as partame or sucralose in addition to their usual food. This was especially true when it was given blindly. For example, forty one healthy obese women were divided into two groups: either consume sucrea or aspartamie over four weeks; they were then assigned to consume whatever they ate afterward. They lost more weight than expected by the National institute of Diabetes and Digestion and Kidney diseases model. A further study examined whether replacing sugar-containing drinks with soft drinks would improve weight gain and Fat accumulation in children. When subjects were no blinded, there may be some effect on mood but no change in appetite or mood. To investigate how obesity can compensate for consumption of artificiallysweet drinks, we studied forty-one normal-women aged 20-50 years who were neither currently dieting nor currently eating. After 4 weeks, each group gained an average of 10 lb at the beginning of the experiment. There were also no effects on hungry or feeling. Expectancies only affected mood only during the baseline week. Aspartume had no effect upon hunger or feelings."
29189928,"The results of this prospective cohort study indicate that almost 60 % of young adult women remain in the healthy body mass category from 1996-2012, with 29 p.m. gain over the next 16 years. This is an important outcome because it indicates that physical activity may be beneficial for weight loss and prevents weight regain. In addition, resistance training does not increase weight gain but may increase Fat-free mass; thus, reductions in fat mass are associated with reduced health risk. A further aim of the study is to examine 16 year trajectories of weight and body Mass in young adults who had remained in their healthy BMI from June 1996 to December 2012. Only three factors were positively associated: low alcohol, moderate/ high physical activities, having 'a university degree'. The mean rate of annual weight gains in each group was consistently over time."" Therefore, the present study will focus on sixteen-year age differences in weight between men and women who have a healthy Body Mass Index in 1996 and determines whether or not there is any level at which exercise is effective forpreventing weight gained."
30369810,"In this study, we examine the strength of two different types of orthodontic braces bonded to one another in vivovio. The shear bonding results are similar between the two groups. For example, the first group has a stronger bond than the second group, which is precoated by Transbond Plus. This study also uses xenonic light to determine the effect of different debonding techniques on bond strength."
24217903,"In patients with acute coronary heart disease, elevated Papp-A levels are associated with increased risk of death or infamyria. A randomized, double blinded trial is performed to assess the effects of lower dose GH replacement for exercise capacity and other echocardiography parameters in adulthood. The mean lean body weight increases by 2.2 pounds; fat mass decreases by 1.17 kg after 6 months; and percent body Fat decrease by 2.5 %). After 15 years, GHD adults show significant improvements in fasting lipoprotein concentration and LDLcholesterol. This study also confirms that growth hormone replacement may be an effective treatment for hypopituity. It has been proposed that this treatment might be more beneficial than statin therapy because it reduces the burden of both inflammation and atherosis. However, studies have not yet examined the effect of such a regimen on blood pressure and body composition."
29399794,"In this paper, Barlow focuses on the flaws of the trial design and reporting. For example, in one study, it was found that patients with epileptic disease had higher bone mineral content than those who were not treated. The results suggest that treatment with a high-dose of vitamin D may be more effective in preventing falls from occurring in epilepsy patients. This is important because there are no well-established methods for predicting bone mass status in older patients after hip injury."
25409296,"In this paper, we examine the effects of moderate- intensity physical activity on body fatness and weight gain in a sample of high school students. The results suggest that vigorous exercise is associated with improved health outcomes for both boys and girls. We conclude that ""higher intensities of physically activity"" are more likely to prevent overweight than resistance training does. A higher score on the CVF test predicts higher amounts of vigorous activity; more variance is explained by vigorous exercises than by moderate ones. This study also suggests that young girls from minority backgrounds may be at greater risk of being overweight when they fail to meet the recommended 60 minutes of active leisure time. Although there is no clear relationship between vigorous activities and body mass, it is suggested that skinfold thickening during adulthood may help predict excessively high bodyfat."
28228371,"This paper describes the effects of dance-based exercises on patients with chronic chest failure. It is compared to other forms of exercise, such as swimming or dancing, in terms of improving functional capacity and quality of life. In particular, it suggests that dancing may be more effective than physical exercise in reducing pain and improving mood in older adults."
28340030,"Sweet Talk is a new type of self-management system that uses text messages to help patients learn about their health and improve their blood glucose. In this paper, we describe the results of an eight-month study in which subjects with Type 1 Diabetes receive daily instructions on how to use sweet talk to manage their condition. After six months, they have improved their A1C scores by reducing their hypoglycies and improving their knowledge of their disease. This paper also discusses two other studies: one concerning telemedicine and another concerning web-based diabetes management. The first was published in 1932; the second was written in 1857. We are now at the point of publication of our final paper."
15846630,"A prospective, i.e. open-label study compares the extent of anal pressure after either technique of subcutaneous or open sphlorotomy on twenty-eight patients who have chronic analysis. The mean value for time was 6.6 min in group A and 9 1 min for groupB. In all patient the fissions healed at One month with significant reduced anally canal pressures: 52 mm Hg after subcution and 47.5 / 35 105cmH 2O after open shphinctery; a 51 per cent reduction in their respective pre-operative measurements. All patients underwent both methods. There were no major differences in continence before surgery in two groups. Preoperative stay, pain scores, complications, and Fissure Healing were prospectively assessed by independent observer. After operation, there was no significant change in continence in both groups but more open patients experience minor imperfections at one week. Cost saving per patient is 1,119 pounds compared with control subjects. This trial examines whether preoperative education during elective color censure is cost effective. It results that shorter times to postoperative scoma education are obtained than conventional post surgical stewardship."
28060187,"The results of the ""Prospect i-ve Study of Prvastatin"" were published in the British Medical Journal. In this trial, prava statin reduced the risk of dying from any cause or major macrovascular event by 19 % over a mean period of 3.2 Years. This was followed by solitary treatment with perindopriml or an angiotesin-converting Enzyme inhibitor for patients who had left ventricular failure or heart failure. These patients also showed significant reductions in death and hospitalization after completing their follow-up studies. A further study was performed on elderly patients with hypertension. It was found that there was no difference in blood pressure during the trial but that it was not sustained throughout the follow up period. Progression into severe heart failing was less frequent than in other groups. That mortality is reduced in r and Omized study inviting 25 percent of subsequent patients screened to attend annual U.S. clinics for first 5 years, but no effort was made to maintenance their previously assigned treatments. There was increased relative risk reduction among any diabetes related end points, diabetes-retrieval death, microvascular diseases, and stroke within the group receiving stricter control. However, they did not have sufficient time to maintain their previous assigned therapy. Thus, the aim of this extended trial was to test whether very elderly people without hypertensives obtain early benefits from antihypersive treatment. They were invited to participate in either double blind treatment or immediate or sedentary control at the conclusion of Hyvet. After two weeks, all deaths due to myocarital infastrutal disease or non-causemyocardial Ion were reduced; however, these events were not associated with long-term benefit. For example, when treated immediately, both fatal and nonfatal attacks were significantly reduced. When delayed treatment was used, such as fasting plasma glutamine, which improved bloodglucosation, then the rate of sudden death was reduced considerably. Furthermore, rapid treatment resulted in shorter durations of life. Finally, we concluded that immediate treatment may be more effective in treating older patients suffering from isolated yopportunities. We extended the doubleblind placebo controlled Systoic Hypertension in France by an open label follow Up program lasting 4 years. Although the outcome was similar to those observed in active treatment, only the delay caused greater mortality. Further analysis was carried out"
20459784,"In this study, we examine changes in physical fitness and body composition among school-aged children from Portugal, Denmark, and Estonia. The results suggest that exercise training may be able to improve health of these children. We also examine the association between physical activity and risk factors for Type 2 Diabetes mellitateus in children aged 9-16 years. This study is a prospective, observational study designed to determine whether or not an exercise intervention can prevent or delay type 2 disease in young adults."
31067200,"In this study, we examine the effect of an ARB on blood pressure in patients with hypertension. We find that it does not seem to have any significant effect on the blood flow response of the sympathetic nerves. However, there is a significant increase in the maximum cross sectional area for both men and women after 24 months of follow-up. The results support the notion that sympathetic activity contributes to excessive vasolation seen in obesity associated hypertensives. Bariaric surgery represents aneffective strategy for bloodpressure control in briskly populated patients who are at risk of developing hypertorture. This paper also discusses the effects of weight gain on changes in body composition, health, and risk factors. It shows that fat loss increases heart rate, blood vessel function, as well as muscle sympathetic nervous activity. These findings suggest that increased sympathic activity may be involved in some pathophysiology of excess blood tension."
28380067,"The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a structured exercise program, called ""tai-chi,"" for improving balance, coordination, fatigue, and depression in patients with multiple sclerosis. In particular, the results suggest that it may be useful for treating symptoms of multiple disease. This paper describes the effects of two different forms of physical exercise on various types of diseases: breastcancer survivors suffering from fatigue and other conditions; and people with chronic fatigue who are not treated by conventional medicine. Aiming to determine whether these practices can be used as an alternative treatment for pain or other symptoms in women with recurrent chest pain, Wu Gan Jian pi has been shown to be particularly effective in relieving such symptoms."
20459783,"In this paper, the authors describe a hip fracture that occurred among women who did not engage in any physical activity during their follow-up. They conclude that moderate levels of activity, including walking, are associated significantly with lower risk for coloncancer than less than 1 hour per week. The results suggest that leisure-time activities may reduce the risk from colon cancer by hormonal mechanisms. Physical activity is also associated with reduced risks of stroke and other diseases. Women who do not participate in vigorous physical exercise have fewer cases of coloncy disease than those who engage only in moderate or high intensities. This study suggests that regular and frequently active lifestyles protect against colonosal disease because they increase the body massindex-associated risk. However, there is no association between frequent and moderately vigorous activity. A comparison of men and women's health at different ages indicates that older women tend to be more physically active. For example, one year after age 55, young women had an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Walking has been shown to reduce these risk factors as well."
29478682,"In this study, the authors describe the quality of patient life compared to that of patients with fixed prostheseses. Forty eight patients agree to participate in all treatment modalitys. The results are described in terms of time efficiency and antibacterial effects. A comparison is made between cleaning efficaciously by using h-files or K-fils and FlexMaster rotary instrumentation. This study also compares the effectiveness of stepback instruments for sterilizing root canals as well as an assessment of the influence of prognostics on the healing ability of teeth treated with Niti rotilated files. It was found that there were significant differences in the amount of bacteria removed from the roots when comparing tooth preparations with file systems. Proposal errors were less frequently observed than those caused by other methods. When fractures were discovered, they were reported. All techniques reduced the size of infection but no significant difference was seen in how much debris was present. Both technique resulted in ""variable presence of residual simear layer."""
28182680,"Preterm infants exhibit more frequent behaviors, indicating ""tear defensiveness"" and ""difficult temperament,"" than their full-term counterparts. In contrast, preterm children's behavior is similar to that of term babies: they have mild problems with sensory perception and temperament. The effects of the infant behavioural assessment and intervention program are compared in very low-birth weight prematurely referred to as IBaip. After follow-up studies, 80-six early-preterm newborns receive stand and ard treatment. A further study examines the effect of quality of experience prior to term on brain development. This study compares late preterminal patients with termborn patients who were not born before. Although there is no difference in outcome for brain volume or short-lived medical outcomes, it does suggest that prematuration may benefit from an individualized care regimen."
30948819,"In this study, the effects of morphine and amlopidine on blood pressure were investigated. The antihypertinesive effect was dose-related and sustained throughout the 24 hours dosing period. A new beta1 blocking agent, bisoprolel, was studied for its efficacy in treating patients with hypertension. It was found that it was more effective than placebo in reducing blood flow to the heart."
17253466,"This paper presents the results of a prospective, observational study of patients with generalized anxious disorder. The subjects were divided into three groups: 1) Cognitive behavior therapy; 2) relaxation-only treatment; and 3) anxiety management training. Although both conditions are effective, they have significant negative effects on quality of life. In addition, there is sensitivity to other anxiety disorders, including major depression. A second paper discusses the efficacy of psychological therapy for older adults with Generalized anxiety disorder in primary care. It reports that CBT-Gad/PC was more effective than usual care in improving mood and depression after six months of follow-up."
25109883,"This study uses a population-based survey to estimate the prevalence of scaropenia in elderly New Mexico. The results indicate that there is significant association between self-report physical disability and health status, independent of race, age, poverty, and other characteristics. In this study, 102 older people aged 60 or 94 years were assigned home-base resistance training as an intervention for improving their health. They showed improved strength, gait Speed, endurance, muscle mass, bone mineral density, mental well-being, etc. These factors were not included in the outcome of the study."
28787537,"The results of this study suggest that a long-term regimen of c and amlodipines can be used to control blood pressure in elderly patients without serious side effects. This is particularly important because older patients with bps above 160mmHg are at greater risk for stroke, myocarial infarction, or heart failure than younger patients who have an SBP over 180mm Hg. In addition, the shorter treatment period leads to lower rates of adverse events. A subset of 415 aged 85 years old were included in the Japanese trial to assess Optimal Spystoic Blood Pressure in Older Elderly hypertensively patients. These patients had better matched mean age 76.1 years; mean bloodpressure 169.5/875 mmhg). Although strict control was not superior to mild control, it was still necessary to determine whether these patients would benefit from more intense treatment. Alone with other patients, however, there was no significant trend toward reduced risks of stroke or death among those with less stringent controls. However, we did find that ""strict control"" was superior when compared to moderate control. We also found that people with high systelic blood levels were much more likely to develop cardiovascular disease after being treated with either type of antihypersive drug. Thus, although some evidence exists regarding the benefits of both types of drugs, such as ramipriml and alpraxin, physicians should continue to use these two different drugs until they reach their target blood level."
26198702,"In this study, we examine the association between microbial composition and the development or severity of epilema in children. We find that Lactobacilus GG is safe at early age and can be used as an anti-atopic disease treatment. The results suggest that it may be useful for infants who have a history of allergic disease to use probiotics. Aproposal of using proliferating strains such as Lactus RhamnosusHN001 has been proposed for the treatment of severe opportunistic epilepsy. However, there are still concerns regarding the efficacy of procultures in preventing recurrent outbreaks of acute ear itch."
25984731,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed description of the aspidin-tolerant patient population. They conclude that the risk of heart attack is higher in patients who are aspirin resistors than in those who have an acute coronary disease. The study also establishes that platelet function is improved by aspartin resistance. Aiming to determine whether lower urinary concentration levels could reduce the risks of stroke and death, we examine the association between asprin tolerance and major adverse events. These results suggest that there may be some modifiability or intervention that can reduce these risk factors. We compare two point-of care test methods for predicting outcome after percutaneous chest surgery: VerifyNow Appropriateness and Multiple Electrodes Platelet Agglomerometry. This study was designed to assess the effects of asprain on platelets function. It showed that although it was not possible to predict future events with either method, both tests proved useful in prediction of outcomes."
17312231,"Epidural anesia reduces the risk of death in patients with major thoracolectomy compared to general anaemia and post-analgesis.

Post-surgery pain management techniques were also studied for their effects on immune function. In this paper, we examine the effect of epidual analga on blood flow in multivessel heart disease. The results suggest that early intervention may reduce the severity of adverse events in older adults with hip fracture. This trial compares multiplemodal optimization with traditional periodic management in consecutive series of patient undergoing colorectric procedures. Adverse cardinal events occurred in two groups during the initial period of study. On the second day of surgery, all patients tolerated surgical well. All 20 treated patients received either local anesthesia or continuous epidramatic analsies. Only one category of morbid outcome occurred less frequently among patients managed by epidasical technique. Most adverse Morbid outcomes in High-risk patients are not reduced By use of combined electroderinum and general Anaesthesia and Postoperative epidural analisa."" There were no important differences between control values in both groups in circulatingcortisol, plasmineogen activator inhibit 1, and betathrombogo Bulin "
26561616,"In this study, we examine the effects of two different dietary sources on blood trigllyceride concentration and lipophosphorylation in patients with hypercholesteremic disease. The results suggest that eating nuts can reduce the risk of heart attack by reducing the amount of fat consumed. We also investigate the effect of coconuts on body weight, blood pressure, and total cholesterol. Consuming them over a period of four weeks is associated with improved lipid profiles as well as reduced risks of cardiovascular disease because they are rich in polyun-saturatedfatty acids. This suggests that consumption of nuts may be beneficial to both men and women who have moderately high glycemia."
30599499,"In this study, we describe the effect of a single arm treatment of patients with severe nondo-refractory spinal cord injury on bladder function. We report that the first two doses of bontoninum toXin A were more effective than placebo in improving urinary tract function in patients who had detruser overactivity. The second dose was even more successful in treating these patients. This is significant because it reduces the risk of infection and other side-effects associated with conventional anticholineric treatments."
30616454,"In this study, we report the results of two different total hip replacement procedures. The first is a conventional technique using femorodal guides and the second is an advanced navigation technique that uses acetabulous cup placement to improve the stability of the patient's limb. Both methods achieve similar results in the early post-survival period. This study also compares the efficaciousness of three different anesthesia approaches for patients with hip arthrostomies. A comparison between these three approaches shows that they can be used to increase the relative precision of both leg length and globe offset as well as reduce outliers during the recovery phase."
30177287,"In this study, 117 patients with peyronie's disease are enrolled in an open-label, placebo-controlled trial to determine the safety and efficacy of IFN 2b therapy. The results suggest that interferon treatment can be used to reduce penile curvture and improve pain."
26416579,"The British Heart Study, a large observational study of heart disease risk in England, found that high-denity lipophosphoproteins were not related to non- cardiovascular disease mortality. However, the relative importance of these two factors was increased by covariate adjustment. In this study, we examined the association between low levels of HDLC and elevated risk for major adverse events in middle-aged men. We also investigated the effect of statin on Pon1 activity in subjects with hyperlipidemia of Type IIA or Type IB. These patients showed an increase in both PAP-AH and PSA-AA activity but did not show any association with atherosclaotic disease. A genome wide association study identified single nucleome polymorphismms within the paraoXonasen 1 gene that were strongly associated with serum paroxonane or arylerase activities but these variant had not been associated either with three-year mechase risk nor with history of either chest disease or myofacial infactoria. This study investigates the relationship between PON1 action and lipid Peroxidation and Antioxidative Stress in patients with type 2 diabetes. After 6 month of treatment, blood levels were reduced and fasting sugar significantly increased in group I and group II. MDA, total cholesterol, and LL levels significantly improved and glutathone reductatases activity significantly declined in groups Iand II when comparing control groups. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the effects of sim vastatin therapy on other diseases such as predialysis. Finally, it was concluded that increasing POM activity may be beneficial in treating hypercholesteremia."
24794372,"After four years, the gains in height are 3.2 +/-.1 in the Quadrel group compared with 0.5 + and / -- 0.6 in Tiw group. The advantage of this treatment in patients with poor growth is that they have greater annual growth velocity during each of the four yrs. In addition, there is no significant dropout bias. A double blinded placebo-controlled study was conducted to determine the effects of gh on adult height after 6 months. It showed a similar effect on last observation height Sds ; 3.4cm vs pretreatment predicted tallness. At study end, adult measurements were available at 33 patients after means treatment duration of 4. During this period, GH has been used to treat short children with ""idiotic short stature"" despite the absence of definitive long-term trials of efficacious treatment. Children treated with GnRha had fewer final heights than controls. However, their final gain was larger than those treated by control groups: 4.4 x 4.9 versus controls : 5. 4.7 & 6.4 mm, respectively P = 0.001"
24808490,"The high-fructose diet produces no changes in blood levels or phospholipoproteins, but it produces a significant increase in the trigllycerides in nineteen men. It is speculated that the effects of sucrose on producing hyperinsulinism may be more important to its potential role in heart disease than their effect on bloodlipids. A study is made of consumption of either cornstarch or fruit juice for five wk and then compares these two diets with those from the United States. Both groups achieve their target for fat and sugar respectively. In children, body mass is similar among all four groups, except for parents who differ in body weight. Consumption of sweetened soft drinks has been reported to be associated with obesity, the metabolic disorder, and cardiovascular disease. However, few studies have investigated the association between added sugar consumption and risk factors for heart attack. This study examines the effect of four equally low-sucosal diet regimens on body composition and health before and after 12 weeks. There is no change in waist circumference during the intervention group; however, there is an improvement in HbA1, only when consumed at fructosic level. After six months, both diet are compared using repeat measures ANOVA. They do not show any differences in fasting blood glucose nor in diurnals. Two diet plans are studied: one consisting of ""fat"" and ""scarce"" fat; the other consistling of starchy foods. These diet results in lower total cholesterol and higher lipoproprotein concentrations than the control diet."
18029834,"Walking is shown to improve blood pressure, body fat, and gait efficiency in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The active group significantly increases physical activity during the intervention period of the study. In addition, there was no significant change in the exercise behavior of control group. After a further six weeks, subjects were roated into two groups: controls and active. This study tested the hypothesize that walking activity followed the American Heart Association's ""physical activity recommendation"" would lower systelic BP in women with type 2 disease. A total of 46 overweight/obse adults aged 52.7-5.2 y were recruited through taverns. They were assigned to walk either 3,000 steps per day or 6,000 steps every day. Their energy expenditure was not increased, but they did not increase their food consumption."
21339335,"In this study, we examine the effects of long-term gh replacement therapy on visceral and lipoprotein concentrations in patients with abdominal obesity. The results suggest that a low-baseline GDR is associated with improved insulinsensitivity. This suggests that short term GH treatment may be beneficial for postmenopauseal women with an increased waist size. We assess the effect of statins on vascular disease in the elderly. However, there is little evidence to support the use of these anti-angion drugs in older men. A prospective, randomized, placebo-control study compares the efficacy of ten-year-old patients receiving rebuffaged ginseng over two years. It shows that both regimens have significant effects on muscle strength and function."
24384894,"A population-based survey was conducted of 883 Hispanic or non-Hispannic white people and women living with New Mexico. The overall mean body mass Index was calculated as a measure of ""appendicular muscle mass"" which is less than two deviations from the mean of an elderly reference group. In this study, we assess the prevalence of severe muscular depletion in patients with lung disease. We examine the use of objective physical functional assessment to predict the severity of these patients' symptoms. This study determines the association between sarcocia and overall mortality in breast cancer patients. It also investigates whether diet can improve survival in advanced staged lung diseases. Megestrol Acetate reduces weight loss by inhibiting tumor necrocisis factor while improving quality of life for patients who have been treated with other treatment regimens."
23419910,"This paper focuses on the effects of eight-week resistance exercise on strength and functions in persons with parkinson's disease. The results indicate that there is a significant change in leg press strength after timed up training, as well as an increase in the maximum relative strength of the body mass. In contrast, the control group shows no significant changes in falls risk scores. A six-month intervention was used to assess the effect of this exercise program on patients with mild or moderately PD. Both groups showed improvement in their performance at rest and in gait speed."
30225547,"In this study, we systematically compare the efficaciousness of four different drugs for treating prematurely ejuculation. The first drug is sertraline, which has a longer mean ielt than the other two groups; the second drug uses sildenalfil citrate as an anaestism to improve early-ejaculations. A single-blinced placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 150 men with premature earcuffs who had been treated for at least one year. All patients completed the study and were divided into 5 groups: 30 patients each. This paper describes the safety and efficiacy of parodytine alone or paroxen plus tame solution in pretermierally ill patients. After six weeks of treatment, Paroixetine improved the latency time by 4.9 minutes compared to that of placebo. Another study examined the effect of phophosphodiesterase inhibitors on premature infanture. It showed that parometine combined with Mirodonafil increased the delay time but did not lead to significant changes in the severity of the disease. Finally, another study investigated the use of topical ananesis to treat premature immobility. Sildenalifil seemed to provide better delayed intercourse satisfaction than parophine and squeeze technique. Furthermore, it was found that there was no significant difference between three or six months after starting treatment."

Results Increasing physical activities had a substantial grade d relation to functional performances."" In this paper, we use an extended framework to investigate the cross-sectal and Longitually relationships between health factors and exercise behavior in adults with osteoarthritis. The results suggest that increasing levels of physical active activity are associated with improved function in older adults who have knee pain."
31415611,"In this paper, we examine the association between unsaturated fats and total fatty acid concentrations in relation to Type 2D risk. We conclude that there is no significant association with these two riskfactors because of their different lengths of chain and because they are not related to incident type 2 disease. A check list of crossover trials is used to evaluate these studies according to Cochran's recommendations. The results of this study do not match those of previous studies. However, it does show that palmolein has a beneficial effect on both blood lipid levels and lipoprotein composition in healthy individuals. This study further investigates the effects of coconut oil on body composition and liver fat accumulation during over-eating. It shows that coconut oils have pronounced effects on fasting and post-fasting glucose levels."
30700025,"The association between 25-hydroxyvinculin D concentration and risk of death in a middle-aged population is established. In this cohort, low levels of 25HhD are associated with all cause mortality. A multivariate adjustedhazard ratio showed that the lowest level of serum 25 Hhd was 1.31; for the highest level, it was 2.32. This suggests that magnesium plays an essential part in maintaining health. Further studies are needed to examine the mechanism of these relationships. All-caluse mortality among diabetics is not associated by 25OHD but rather by other risk factors. Vitamin D has been shown to reduce the risk or mortality of many diseases. For example, one study found that higher levels had an irrational relationship with blood disease. Another study reported that lower levels were more likely than high levels to predict all causes of deaths. These results suggest that vitamin D may have an importance on improving overall mortality as well as some types of chronic disease such as heart disease and hypertension."
25431132,"In this study, the effects of six-month exercise on women's health are compared. The results indicate that physical training can improve menopause related symptoms and quality of life. Women with regular menstrual periods have greater annualized rate of bone loss than those with irregularly regimentd bodies. Two studies in the 1990s suggest that breastcancer is not associated with increased risk of death or recurrance of stroke in patients with previous breast tumors. Estrogan therapy does not reduce the risks of dying alone; relative risk : 0.8 to 1.16; 95 percent Confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.4. A pilot study suggests that restorative exercises may decrease hot flusheses and improve qualityof life among overweight women. This study also examines whether exercise training induces changes in vasomotion and other postmenopalasal symptoms. It finds no significant differences in severity between the control group and the intervention group. However, there was an improvement in sleep quality in both groups. Furthermore, exercise seems to improve mood and mental health in older women who have been preoccupied with their own health problems."
28686645,"The results of this study suggest that a daily dose of 50000 IUs of vitaminD could help prevent hypertension and aid control in patients with elevated blood pressure. In the treatment group, 42 patients were assigned to two groups: the first group received 100 ng. hcg of chollecalcifererol weekly and the second group was assigned one capsule  contained 50 000 iu of paraffin as usual for 8 weeks. After four years of follow up, the relative risks of incident hypertensiveness among men who measured 25-hydroxyvinmin D levels were compared with their predicted levels. Men deficient in 25,OHD were at an increased risk for myochondria after controlling for factor known to be related to coronary arteries disease during 10 years' follow-up. This conclusion supports the use of high-dose Vitamin D to improve bone growth but does not reduce the risk of severe morbity or death from young low birth weight infants. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials is performed to assess the effects of either daily dosage of 500 nmol./L on depression symptoms. There are no significant changes in mental well being in the placebo intervention group. However, there has been no improvement in mood scores in both groups."
26548872,"The bond strength of two different types of resin cement are compared in this study. Alumina and silica-coating increase the bond strengths of both groups, but no significant differences are found among the other groups. Bond strength is measured using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey tests. Shear bonds were calculated for all specimens after 24 hours dry and thermocycling. In addition, there was no difference in the fracture strength between Groups B, C, and D. After three ageing regimens, each specimen was exposed to ten days of water."
24514899,"This study focuses on the use of statins in patients with high-risk heart disease. In this study, we find that there is no significant difference between the percentages of patients who have achieved low-Dcholesterol goals and those who are not at these goals. We conclude that both regimens produce similar effects on lipoprotein levels. Both groups show a significant decline in major artery events; however, the combination group has fewer deaths than the single-blind placebo group. A post-hoc analysis examines switching to eztimibe after switching from simvastain to bastardly atorvastationin. The results suggest that treatment with escallation does not reduce the risk of death from acute coronary disease or stroke. However, it does lead to improvements in other lipid profiles as well as in changes in proinflammatory activity. Two-hounded and forty- three patients were assigned to receive either statink dose or colesevalam hydrochode. These patients showed improved endothelic function when ezetimbe was added to their usual dosage for four weeks. They also showed greater reductions among LDL-lowering effects. Furthermore, they demonstrated an improvement in ApoA1 level during the 12 week follow-up time."
17988396,"This paper describes a social-marketing program for distributing insecticides to malaria-infected children in 18 villages of the Kimbollero and Umlanga districts. It was particularly successful in improving the distribution of essential material by 34 %) and increasing the availability of necessary supplies by 19 0%. The objective of study was to determine the effectiveness of governments regulation of private pharmacist practice in 'low- income country'. Sixteen percent of patients were treated in private practices, and most were moved to public health service within six months after treatment. In this paper, we describe an ort intervention campaign that used ""local perceptions of disease management"" to improve the efficacy of Ort therapy in rural areas of Western India. We conclude that it is possible to use commercial approaches as well as mass communication techniques to further treat diarrhaeal disease in low-income areas."
20524996,"In this study, we examine the effects of artificial sweetener on body composition in overweight and obese women. The subjects were assigned to either a free living control group or an intervention group. After two-weeks of treatment, the subjects lost significant amounts of their body weight but did not show any changes in appetite or mood. We conclude that increasing the mineral content over twofold by drinking large volumes of aspartamine or high-factor sugar syrup does not increase body fat or abdominal fat among postmenopauseal women; however, there is no significant relationship between these two groups."
30302558,"In a double blinded, placebo controlled trial, Lipid levels decrease significantly in the aggression group. Ezetimbe plus rocuvastatine 10mg reduces LDL cholesterol less than did  Rosuvacin 20mG; no significant change is seen in high density lipodyprotein or hepatosis levels between groups. A prospective Indian patient study determines whether adding ezeptimibe to statin therapy can improve patients' health by reducing their total cholesterol and improving their lipid profiles. The results of this study are described in terms of improvement in both low-dension lipoprotein and acylcholestrolemia. Both regimens are well tolerated for 16 weeks. For measure of cholesterol goal attainment, treatment arms are compared with logistic regression analysis. This study compares the effects of two regimen treatments on lower-DL-C levels in patients at moderately risk for heart diseases. These patients were treated with open- label rosuvastatiin 10 milligrams per day but not at higher doses because they were at very high risk of cardiovascular disease. They were divided into three groups: 1) patients with coronarry heart disease, 2) patients without atherotic vascular Disease, and finally 3) patients who had already been treated using statinates. After 12 weeks, these patients received either ezetamibe or sim vastatin. At least half of them achieved their LLD-c goals after switching to one of the other two schemes."
29397561,"The effect of the combination of statin and ezetamibe on Type 2 diabetes mellitus is studied in this study. In addition, it was shown that adding ezetimbe to simpvastatin improves lipoprotein profiles in type 2 patients with hypercholestemia who fail to achieve their recommended lipid goals. This study also showed that a combination treatment of ezetimibe-and/or placebo significantly reduced both total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations in subjects with Type 1 or Type 2, although no significant differences were seen between groups."
24954489,"The prosthesis is fixed to the patient's bone in a double blinded randometric study. After two years, there is no difference in migrating of the prostheses except for an early subsidence at 4 years. A comparison between cement and polyethylene cements shows that the Simplex-AF cement is more viscoused than SimpleX-P; however, it does not show any significant differences in stem rotation or translation. In addition, the patients with uncemented complete knee replacement have less bone mineral density after 3 months. They also report that they do not loosen during bearing. However, their recovery is improved by partial weight bearing from the first year onward. This suggests that this type of prothesis may be useful for younger patients who are still recovering from hip fractures."
29739343,"In the elderly, relationships between physical activity, body weight, and circulating inflammatory markers were examined. The relationship was not significant for either of these groups; however, in older women, it was significantly related to less dependence with less inflammation. A cross- sectional validation study was performed on four patients aged 65 or more who had been participating in a population-based study. When asked about their self-reports of exercise, they reported that forced expiratory volumes were associated with interleuvinin 6, phosphorus, insulin, Cortisol, Epineprihrine, glucose,and insulin. Postexercise did not lead to any change in muscle glycogen content. Because inflammation may be part of many old age-related chronic diseases, which frequently cause disability, high circling levels of ill-interferon may contribute to function decline"
24714894,"In this study, we examine the association between body fat and blood pressure among schoolchildren in a Latin American city. We find that overweight and obesity are associated with elevated blood-pressure levels in boys and girls. This is an important finding because it suggests that schools may be able to help children control their weight and improve their health. The results of the study suggest that school should be used as an agent for change in order to prevent future cardiovascular disease."
25427719,"The study consists of sixteen patients with moderate to severe hypertension who were treated with either metoproll or a combination of two different drugs for 6 weeks. Arousement was significantly reduced in the first treatment, but it was not significant during the second and third treatment periods. Metorolol did not have any significant effects on blood pressure. In addition, the combined use of dihydralzine and hydrogenchlorothazide led to greater reductions in heart rate and pulse resorption. These results suggest that pind OXprenosolola does not influence noradrenin or adrenaline concentration at all. Major side effects occur in three patients each treatment is given for four weeks after adequate period of withdrawing from any other hypotensives and one week out of placebo washout. Sixteen patients had mild to moderately hyper tension. Thirteen untreated men received placebo treatment while they were roused and ommized. They were then divided into two groups: 1) continued placebo treatments for three weeks; 2) repeated double blinded placebo runs-in/ screening periods; and3) treatment with ACEbutoLOL 400mg twice daily. Blood pressure fell rapidly as compared with the placebo regimen. This showed that both antihypertines could be effective in reducing blood flow. However, there was no difference in mean stystoic or diaspital bloodpressure between 200mc celiproliole daily and 400 mg per day. No serious adverse events occurred. Only minor side effect was noted. There was only slight improvement in patient satisfaction."
19683859,"In this study, we examine the expression of seven P2X-receptors in male patients with symptomatic detrusosor instability. We compare these receptors to those found in control bladders. The results suggest that they may play a role in curing or arresting overactive bladder."
26561769,"In this paper, the authors examine the effect of a daily cap-ac solution on tooth decay and bond strength. They conclude that Cpp-Ac is superior to other anti-cavity agents in preventing teeth from decay because it prevents formation of cracks while also reducing the need for additional cement. The results of the study are presented as an outcome of histological analysis. Both groups have similar success rates after four to five years. A new universal adhesive system has been used to restore primary dentinal surfaces. It shows no significant difference in bonding strength between intact or caries affected dentine. This study compares two different types of self-etched and totaletch systems to denitin. All three show higher bond strengths than one-up bond F. However, mixed failures are frequently observed. These include: 1) Mixed failure due to secondary Caries; 2) Unusual failure caused by fractures; and 3) Poor quality restorations."
16933148,"In this study, we examine the effects of an ergonomics training program on workers' pain, symptoms, and functional limitations. We find that both groups experience significant reductions in pain from pre-to-post measures after three months with improved results continuing to twelve months post baseline. The primary risk factors for WRUE are female gender, age, ethnicity, prior history of shoulder or neck pain; and workstation size and posture. Both groups report improvements in discomfort during the first two months of follow up. However, there is no difference between groups for any other outcome measures. For example, patients who have been working at a desk for more than fifteen hours per week show signs of improvement in their pain over the course of six months. This suggests that they may be able to improve their health by improving their workstyle habits. A parallel group design has been used to evaluate the effect of one work station and one postural intervention on the incidenceof musculodyskeletal symptoms among office workers. Twenty two participants were assigned to alternate intervention groups, 25, 20.2 %) in the alternate intervenment group, 25 % inthe conventional intervention group: and 25 11.7 p.m. reported incident arm or leg and symptoms. Conclusive results suggest that it may reduce the risk of these conditions by encouraging specific sitting postures keyed with elbow height above the height of ""J"" key. These results indicate that the risks of such disorders may not be reduced by encouragement of specific seated positions. After 6 weeks, only small changes in headache and visual discomfitment are noted. An experimental group consisting of 12 control subjects receives no training. No improvement occurs in worker productivity or well being. Musculoskeletal complaints occur more frequently in those under forty years of age. There is also evidence that eye drops can be useful in treating computer vision syndrome. Itone does not cause any side-effect but seems to be helpful in some cases."
28251287,"We examine whether a progressive exercise program and nutrient-enriched food can further augment an adaptive response to resistance training in elderly people. Type II muscles fiber size increases over time in either placebo or protein groups. Strength was measured regularly by 1-Repetitionmax, strength testing. Muscle mass and strength were measured on whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptionsorptometry, limb, computed tompiometry; and muscle fiber body composition was determined after the training program. The narrator reports that leucine has been shown to increase gains in fat-free masses during recurrent resistance type exercise training. In older adults, however, there is no significant change in their muscle strength at both age and gender. A recent study suggests that consumption of glucose may be beneficial for improving muscle function in older men. This study also shows that it does not lead to changes in body mass but rather improves muscular strength and performance."
28215182,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective observational study on patients with acute pain over time. We found that there was significant agreement between the VAS and the Numeric Rating scale within one hour of arrival. The mean difference in pain intensity was significantly greater for older patients than for younger patients. A further study is performed on children who have had an episode of severe or chronic pain. This study determines whether changes in scores on the Pain Relief Score are related to changes seen on other measures of health-related outcome such as perceived need for medication, pain relief, and satisfaction with treatment."
25577154,"Losartan is more effective than Atenolal in preventing heart attack and mortality in patients with critical hypertension. In the All-Haven treatment to prevent Heart Attack trial, we found that perindoprime reduces the risk of heart failure by as much as two times its usual rate. The reduction was even greater in older subjects who had left atrial mass less than other drugs for the treatment; however, this did not lead to any significant changes in blood pressure. A sub-study was performed on 6083 people with hypertensives who were aged between 65 and 84 years old. They were followed for an average of four years. Their main outcome was MyoCardal Infa Rct Ion, Stroke, or Cardiovascular Death. Both treatments reduced the major cardiovascular events but also reduced myocarpal infacultation. These results are similar to those reported in the previous studies. This study concludes that both antihypertinesive agents have different effects upon cardiac and largeartery remodelling. Angiotesin-converting inhibitors seem to be superior to diurestics because they can lower blood flow better than calcium channel blockrs. However, there is no difference in their effect on cerebral hemodynamo and cognitive function. Furthermore, these results suggest that neither amlopidine nor chlorthalidene are superior against diuretics."
29088103,"In this study, we investigate the efficiacy of a probiotic in preventing enterocololitis and death in very lowbirth weight infants. The results suggest that the use of boulardisii reduces the risk of necrotising Enterocolitis but does not lead to fatalities. This study also confirms our previous observation that feeding preterm babies with bacteria improves their gut health."
31835340,"Forty three consecutive patients with recurrent shoulder pain undergoes a series of examinations, including MRI, sonography, and ultrasound. The results suggest that the severity of the disease is related to bone march odema as well as to the extent of disease activity. In addition, the sensitivity of both methods for detecting bone erosions is very high. For example, when compared to plain radiography, it is found that large fractures are more easily detected. To further determine whether musculonoskeletal radologists can predict whole body health at six years, they perform rheUMATOID arthritis-specifically magnetic resonance imaging. This technique has great potential for early detection of bony lesions in RA."
31907492,"In this paper, we examine the effect of feeding infants with soy formula on regurgitation. We find that feeding a fiber-based formula reduces the frequency of repeating bouts after 7 days, but it does not increase the risk of developing cow milk allergy. The aim of this study is to determine whether consumption of such an enriched formula can be associated with increased risk for cowmilk allergy in young children. Our results suggest that feeding soluble fiber at least partially increases the rate of infantile relinquishment by reducing the severity of early pubertinal signs. Thus, our study suggests that adding sory to infant's diet may improve their health."
29480736,"In this study, the effects of psylium on fat and lipid profiles in overweight patients are investigated. The results suggest that prebiotics may be effective in reducing blood tyrannical levels as well as improving body weight. A double blind, placebo controlled trial was performed with thirty obese women who were treated with either ITF or maltodeextrin for three months. After treatment, both groups showed modest changes in their gut merriment. They also showed an increase in Faecalbacterium and Boridobacculus prausnixii. This study included a participantblind, rand and Omized control crossover trial. At baseline, 44 %) of subjects were overly overweight or obese. However, after the feces period resulted in more short chain fatty acids than the CD period. Both groups had reduced fasting blood sugar and insulin concentrations. There was no significant change in total cholesterol or lipopolity-phosphorus ratio between the two groups. These results did not lead to any improvement in other measures of health. Fat percentage is calculated using Jackson's and Pollock 7, caliper methods and Siri equation. Alginate supplementations do not improve body mass index or fat percent. Although they have been used in various studies, these studies have not yet been published in the Middle East."
15145632,"This study focuses on the effects of relaxation training on patients with Type II who are not intolerant of conventional medicine. The results suggest that stress-relief training may be an effective treatment for these patients. In this study, we examine the effect of progressive relaxation and EMG Biofeedback on blood glucose control in subjects with type 2diasis. Although both treatments produce significant weight loss, neither group achieves significant changes in body weight. We conclude that ""progressive relaxation"" training does not improve diabetic controls in mildly stressful subjects."
16299094,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effect of a participaatory ergonomics program on workers suffering from back pain. The results suggest that an early intervention is necessary to prevent long-term pain disability. This intervention has aided in the reduction of work-related sickness absence and has been associated with improved return to work for workers who have returned to normal work after six weeks of the program."
27605376,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of long-term illness on health-regarding quality of life in patients with severe obesity. After five years, weight loss is 27 % to 11 %) and a return on investment is estimated from the results. The study concludes that there is no association between medical problems or work-related factors that lead to poor employment for obese subjects. However, it does suggest that bariaric surgery may be an effective treatment for severe overweight."
24318196,"In this study, we report the results of an eight-year follow-up period for patients who received either cementless or cemented prostheses. The mean knee scores were excellent in both groups. After comparing the pre- and post-opportunity factors, it was found that there was no difference in the rate of survival between side of operation and age. There was only a slight difference at the age of 55 years; however, when compared to the other group, the mortality rate was very similar. A series of 512 total knee replacements were performed with either cement or cementlessness. At the end of the chapter, ""The Knee Society Clinical Score showed significant increase from75"" before surgery until 180"" after 5.6 years. This is due to patient's functional component. Cement less prosthesis seems to provide comparable early results. We compare the effect of cement placed beneath the tial component of freeman-samueleon totalknapped knees as well as cruciately retained prosthetics using press fit condyllar prosthes."" The result of these two studies is that they have equivalent early outcomes. For fifty-five complete knee archplasties, all are performed by screwless fixations."
31136527,"In this study, we examine the effects of meto Clopramide on the resolution of colorectastomy in patients who had elective color bowel surgery. The results suggest that early feeding can be an effective strategy for reducing post-operative discomfort and improving recovery. We also assess the duration of hospital stay and complications in both groups. Early feeding is associated with improved patient satisfaction and reduced morbidity. A double blind controlled trial was undertaken to determine whether or not Metoclopream improves the time to pass flatus after colorectomy. It was found that it did not alter the severity of postocular ileus but increased the incidence of fever, haggardness, and pulmonary infections. This study concludes that metoprolamine does not significantly change the course of Postoperative Illus. However, seven patients were excluded because of death, one small intestinal obstruction requiring Laparotomie, two anaspistic leakage resulting in laparostomy, four protocol violations and four protocols violations. Prolonged Ileus was seen among 7 patients in group 1 and in 8 patientsin Group 2."
18278178,"In this study, we examine the risk of a stroke in patients who are taking aspirine. We find that those with intermittent atrial fibrilation have lower rates of stroke than those without sustained AF. Consumption of alcohol is also associated with reduced risk; however, women and history of hypertensity may also increase the odds of an icroscopic stroke. A recent study reports that new thrombolic strokes occur in 162 patients with non-rheummatic atrium fibrillation. These patients were assigned to placebo treatment for 1.3 years. The results suggest that these patients can be stratified into low-risk groups by age, gender, heart failure, and other risk factors. For example, elderly patients treated with antiplatelet therapy could be compared with controls who had no previous stroke or systemic embolism. Anticoagulant therapy was more effective than warfarin when preventing stroke from occurring in older patients."
29119371,"In this paper, we describe the frequency of revisions for primary total hiparthroplasty in patients under age 55. We examine the results of a five-year observational study among 321 patients and assess the outcome of surgery with use of an acetabulous cup. The result is that there are no complications or major fractures during the follow-up period. A tripotol constrainedliner was used to cemented into one well-fitted cementless ACEtabular shell. There were only 113 consecutive hip archplasties, either primary or revision. With the rates of asepticloosning around two % and dislocation around 1 p.m., the cup seems to be as effective as any other available device."
31684688,"In this paper, we describe the results of a large number of trials that have not yet been published in journals. The majority of these studies are well-received and do not mention outcome reporting bias. All patients receive either human growth-hormones alone or in combined with oX and rol one. After three to six years of treatment, all subjects exceed their expected adult tallies. For girls with Turner Syndrome, starting growth promotion before 9 years could not be the most effective way to increase final height. This study is an attempt to assess the effects of spin on meta-analyses by comparing the effect of both treatments on absolute height and bone mineral content. At year 4, the change in Absolut Heights and height Scores was greater in group 1 compared to group 2 ; at year 3, the difference in absolute Height and Elevation Score were larger in the gh/Ox group versus  G/pl group. A follow-up trial of young adults who received GH treatment for Turner syndrome showed that it resulted in improved bone health but did not affect breast development. Although there was no significant difference between the control groups, the mean gain in total height was significantly higher in women receiving rhG alone than in those receiving placebo. Furthermore, short-term ginshad increased body composition but reduced relative impairment of sugar tolerance and insulinsensitivity. Short- term gandowry was associated with advantageous changes in bodily composition as well as relative improvement of glucose toleranceand insulin sensibility. Thus, after 12 months of long-lived chivalric treatment over two years, subject's height reached about 3 cm above the predicted adult height when matched controls. Finally, another study examined the influence of voice function in patients with Type 1, Turner Seizure. It found that speech frequency was relatively low in females treated with glutinary therapy because of the high frequency of reported voice problems among untreated patients. Another study looked at the impact of somatretem on height gains in children with type 2, especially in terms of social adjustment. These studies suggest that early intervention may prevent further growth failure in some patients without any sexual experience."
25701331,"In this study, we examine the effects of glucosalan on blood pressure and body weight in overweight subjects. The results suggest that it may be an effective treatment for patients with primary hypercholestemia. We conclude that using soluble fiber can be used as a preventative measure against primary hypocholesterol disease."
28251861,"In this study, we examine the effects of a whole body vibration treatment on lower musculosity, muscle strength, and balance among stroke patients. We conclude that exercise is superior to other forms of exercise for improving both leg and arm strength in older adults."
23736734,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates that the use of modified Roux-En-Y bariatic surgery to treat Type 2 diabetes is safe and efficacious. He concludes by stating that patients with severe obesity who have undergone such a procedure are likely to benefit from it. The results suggests that severe weight loss in an obese population may be beneficial for improving both health and long-term outcome. This report is published in the journal of the American College of Anaesthesy. It reports that there has been no significant change in blood pressure or changes in body mass over two years after the surgery. However, several patients experienced complications during the follow-up period. These included early gastric bypass wounds, loose stools, and delayed gallstones. Although these complications were rare, they occurred frequently."
29520083,"In this study, we investigate the effects of a daily folate depleted diet on neurologic and memory function in elderly women. We conclude that folic acid is an effective treatment to prevent carcinogenesis because it reduces the amount of ""methyl groups"" in the body's nucleus which are involved in autocylation. The results suggest that moderately-folatedepleteed older women should be given two different dietary regimens for their maintenance. After seven wk they each receive 200 or 500 mg/d of foleretion. These treatments have no significant effect on mood or memory performance. However, there are some positive effects on certain measures of mental function only. Furthermore, these studies show that short-term consumption of B12 has been shown to improve brain function. A recent study suggests that long- term folicacin treatment may be more effective than other forms of anti-cancer therapy. This study also shows that patients with elevated blood levels of homocychsteine appear to be at increased risk of stroke and heart disease."
30050958,"In this paper, we extend our previous work by comparing the effects of l-carntine and placebo on quality of life after 8 weeks in patients with severe dialysis. The results suggest that licortine may be useful in improving qualityof life for patients who have been unable to maintain their normal health. We also examine the effect of carnine on lipids and anemia in hemodylysis patients. There is no significant change in the values of these two groups; however, there is a significant reduction in total cholesterol among the control group. Furthermore, both groups show signs of reduced trigllyceride and increased levels of LDLcholesterol. This suggests that leptiner treatment may suppress inflammation in sick patients without kidney disease or in chronic peritoleal diaticulation."
22719834,"In this study, we examine the effects of olazapine on weight gain and severity in patients with schizofid disorder. After six weeks of treatment, subjects are assigned to either a placebo-controlled or rand-omized regimen. The most frequently adverse events reported were headaches, nausea, somnolation, and insomnia. A mean change in weight was noted for haloperidomel at the end of the trial. There was no difference in any outcome measures between stayers or switchers. This study is designed to compare the safety and efficacy characteristics of both drugs. For example, patients who switched from one drug to another during their initial treatment period had greater weight gains than those who did not. Both groups showed significant improvements on the Hamilton Depression And Anxiety Score, ClinicalGlobal Impressions Improvement, CgI-I, scale, as well as laboratory examinations. These results suggest that there may be some confounding factor involved in the decision to switch from an antipsychotic to an overdose of other anticholinerics such as bupropion. However, these studies do not reveal any differences in patient response after 12 weeks."
29292213,"The effect of atorvastain on lipoprotein, lipids, and blood flow in patients with mild to moderate CKD is described. In this study, we compare the effects that bezafisibrate 200mg twice daily has on plasma levels of glucose, endotriumal function, inflammation, factor VII, pachiotene, interleukin-2, and tumor necroseisfactor- in subjects with severe hypertrigllyceridemia. Both treatment results in improved insulin sensitivity but do not lead to improvements in other risk factors. This study concludes that fibrate administration improves fastness and postporr and aial end Othelial Function in Type 2 diabetes. It also reports that gemfibrozel reduces major cardiovascular events among persons with type 2 disease. Fenforibe therapy was associated with reductions in major Cardiovascular events in persons without diabetes, but not in those with newly diagnosed diabetes; however, it was reported that fiber therapy reduced major Heart Disease death, stroke, or Myocardial Infastrutal Infection."
20739918,"A prospective, i.e. blinded study is designed to identify the prevalence of low back pain in 15-year old schoolchildren and to determine which findings relate to age or prior back symptoms. In this study, we examine the frequency of MRI findings among patients without current lowback pain. We conclude that there is no relation between the severity of the pain and the presence of nerve root compression on a lumbar spindle. This study also establishes an association between hearing difficulty and finger blanchment. It is reported that people with severe hearing difficulties are more likely to have disc hernitation than those with no such condition."
23959778,"In this paper, we describe the results of a double blinded placebo-control study of children with autism who had been followed for 13 to 22 years. Six of the 12 patients had died at follow-up, and six were declined participation in the study. A similar study was performed on children without autistic disorders. This trial examined the efficacy or safety of liquid flicit in treating repetitive behaviors in children aged 9 to 18 years old. The subjects received no significant changes in their behavior after treatment. Further studies are needed regarding the use of psychotropics among young children as well as health system characteristics related to drug use."
25345420,"The effects of a daily intervention on children with newly-diagnosed attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder are reported. There is no significant change in behavior, cognition, or qualityof life; however, significant adverse events do not occur. A study has been conducted to evaluate the efficaciousness of group hypnosis for children suffering from separation anxiety disorder. In this study, forty-five children aged 8 to 14 years old were treated with either morphine or placebo during their first three months of treatment. They showed improvements in self-efficacy, quality of life, and other measures of well-being. After two weeks of continuous treatment, patients' scores improved by an average of 26.2 points. This suggests that there may be some value in broadening the treatment beyond core symptoms. Children with both types of disorder show improvement in their health after eight months: ADHD/DCD groups showed more improvement than those without ODD. However, they did not show any changes in physical health or mental health."
25044052,"In this paper, Festinger et al. concludes that payment in cash is associated with improved follow-up participation and reduced tracking efforts. However, the mode of payment -- cash or gift card -- does not increase new drug use nor perceptions ofcoercion. A previous study found that attention-defiant hyperactivity disorder creates 'a higher riskfor adverse driving outcomes' among adult males who have an excessively high level of ADHD. This study further extends those results to higher payments magnitudes. Furthermore, it shows that there are no significant differences between age groups in symptoms over treatment. The efficacy of combined treatment was evaluated by ADHD symptom scores from apprehension and parent report along with objective measurements of inattential driving errors. Methhylphini date improves driving performances of adults with ADHD; they perform better when receiving Oros MPH x.d..compared with placebo condition. Both dosages significantly improve driving performance for subjects aged 19 to 24 years with ""AD/HD"" but do not show any apparent improvement in driving behavior. Lisdexamfatmine Dimesylate has been shown to reduce driving behaviors in patients with both Type I and Type IV ADHD"
9470890,"Back pain is a common cause of back pain in many different occupations. A study evaluating the efficacy of an exercise program for back injury in geriatic patients was performed. The results showed that the calistherics program was more effective than the other two treatment groups because of the increase in abdominal muscles strength and trunk forward flexing. In addition, there were no differences in lost time or workday injuries between the two groups. Another study examined the effect of wearing belts while working. This study found that wearers who did not wear the belt during their work day had fewer days of missed work due to low back discomfort."
29609665,"In this paper, Shycle demonstrates how to use the cochrane's risk-of-bias assessment tool to assess the effect of diet on pigs. The results suggest that microbial feeds increase phytate concentration in a consuming hog and that it may lead to greater digestibility when compared to conventional feeding. This is an important step in the development of animal intervention studies."
27550905,"The Consot statement, a guide to reporting of random-effects in vivo and spectral studies, was revised in May 2000. It now includes ten items, including 'a 22-Item checklist' and nine flow diagrams. Although the response rate for this request was good, it is not enough to prevent bias from occurring. Only 18 trials have been completed during the survey period; only 395 un published trials were reported."
31264084,"In this study, we investigate the effects of acute trans-Reveratrol consumption on endotolhelial function. We conclude that it does not improve fasting blood pressure in patients with endogeneal dysfunction. A double blind rand cross-over, doubleblind omize-controlled trial is performed to investigate whether an acute dose of aqueous reversal of propterinics can be used to treat hypertensively obese subjects. The results indicate that there is no significant change in brachial and iary inflammation response after mealtime in abdominally obesity older adults. This study was registered at Ct.1st date as NCT03964846; there was also an increasing amount of evidence supporting curcumin's role in proinflammatory processes."
27898180,"In this first study, we examine the efficacity of a negative-apic pressure irrigation in dogs' teeth. The results indicate that the treatment is more effective than conventional irrigation methods for reducing the amount of bacteria in the canals. We also compare the effect of two different types of irrigation: 1) passive ultrasonic irrigation and 2) positive-pressing irrigation. Both systems result in significant reductions in both the number of colony formations and the size of the root canal."
27124611,"This study examines the effect of a physical-activity intervention on patients with multiple Sclerosis. It is found that changes in physical activities are associated with improvements in symptoms of depression, fatigue, pain, and selfefficacy. The results suggest that an accelerometer-bearing device may be useful for predicting whether people will fall or not. A second study investigates effects of an exercise program on walking performance in stroke survivors. In this study, subjects wear an electrode for seven days to assess their progress during the courseof their recovery. After six months, they wear another device as well to measure their activity. There is resemblance between the electrodes' values and those of other measures used by physicians."
23002379,"In this study, Anderson demonstrates that cloza pine can be used as an antipsychotic in patients with mild to moderate disease. He concludes that it is more effective than rispirone in treating severe and poor-response patients who have failed to respond to other antipsyotics. The primary endpoint of the study is reduction in the severity of symptoms for positive and negative syndrome on the Positive or Negative Syndrome scale. This results in a significant decrease in both groups. For example, half of those treated with cynical treatment showed improvement in their symptoms after 10 weeks of addition of 600mg/day bristol. However, these patients were not included in any efficacy studies because they had no response to previous treatments."
29228348,"In a prospective, obliquely manipulated study of 100 prediabetics, the results suggest that flax seed can be used as an effective and early intervention to prevent disease. The effect is not significant in terms of changes in blood pressure or body weight. Flax'seed also improves insulin resistance but does not lead to any change in other markers of disease such as C-reactive lipoprotein or TNF-inflammation. This suggests that fat may be useful in reducing these risk factors. A double blinded crossover study compares the effects of coconut oil on fasting glucose, total cholesterol, and gycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Both groups show marked improvement in their blood sugar levels."
27278232,"Estradiol and progestesterone levels are increased in women who use oral contraceptive drugs. Estrogin levels increase after consumption of alcohol. Menstrual cycle duration is shorter than that of women using conventional contraception. Women with a higher body mass tend to have longer menstruals, but this is not seen in the study of patients with severe menopause."
11279762,"The efficacy and safety of morphine in the immediate treatment of acutely ill patients is described. A prospective, open-label, random-experimentation study was conducted to determine whether halopridol or flunitated promethazine were superior to placebo in treating patients with severe psychosis. In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to the use of an untested, unpredictable drug for the management of patients who have been subjected to aggressive or violent behavior. They conclude that these patients require rapid tranquilization but are not likely to respond well to conventional approaches."
28126565,"The results of this study indicate that men with low levels of 25 hydroxyvinculomin D are at increased risk of developing nonfatal heart disease. In contrast, those with high levels do not develop myocardial infascibility or fatal chest disease after controlling for other risk factors. A parallel-group, doubleblind, placebo controlled trial was conducted among 45 HIV patients in Clevel; and the primary outcome was changes in flow-mediated brachial blood pressure. The mean reduction in spitting blood is -6.6 mm HG compared to 1.29 % of the daily dose of vitaminD. Meta-Aids We conduct a parallel group,double blinded r and Omized control trial wherein no change inflow-median dilatation occurred in the treatment groups relative to placebo. There was also no improvement in circulatory function measured by pulse wave velocity, insulin resistance, elevated lipids, circulating signs of inflammation, etc. This study investigates the effects of alpha-cholecalcificerol on serum MCP1 concentrations in patients with chronic CKD who have been deficient in their 25-hydroxyvitamine D levels. Although there were no significant differences between groups, they were still significantly different even after controls for baselinecovariates."
23633374,"This study aims to determine the prevalence of atrial fillation in patients aged over 50 general practices in the Westmidland. The intervention practice is divided into two groups: 1) systematic and 2) opportedunistic. In the intervention group, physicians receive education on how to detect and interpret atrium fibrillation. More than half of the patients are not on anticoagulants or aspirin for stroke prevention. A total of 1,500 subjects aged 70-years and over live at home. Anticoagulant drugs are less effective in stroke preventment with aspidin being able to be more effective. Cardiovascular disease is major causes of Morbidity and Mortality in older people. Atrial Fibrillations has been recognized as an important risk factor for heart failure and stroke. However, there is no evidence that this condition can be prevented by routine medical care. There is also little evidence regarding the efficacy of different methods of testing for attritial fibrilation; however, it is reported that one strategy may lead to earlier detection and appropriate treatment when used together with other approaches."
28407810,"This paper describes the cost-efficiency of a combined intervention of health workers and trained GPs to prevent malaria in children. Costeffectiveness is determined by comparing the three different treatment regimens that are used in this study. The most cost effective regimen is community-based volunteers, who achieve the highest cure rate. However, the overall cost for each patient is higher in the health facility than in any other treatment arm. In addition, there is an increased risk of counterfeit medicine due to the high quality of pharmacists employed in South Africa."
26420598,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of one y of calcium and vitaminD on bone mineral densiputation in patients with low energy fractures. After 9 mo, there was significant loss of bones in all groups; there were 136 treated subject, 52 strictly controls and 73 controls altogether. Bone turnover relative to base line value was significantly greater for the active group than the placebo group, but it did not reach significant significance. Calcium-supplementation reduced bone loss in older women who had a recent lower-energy fracture. In addition, the effects of cavitamin D plus 1,000mg elemental changes were also significant. Cacalcitonine increases bone mass by increasing the amount of trace mineral intake that can be obtained from the diet. A double blinded prospective trial examines the healing process between parathyroidhormone, crosslinked teopeptide or procollagen, and osteocalcin in postmenophausal women at age 57. Thirties healthy post menopausals aged 59 are assigned to either 1,800 IU vitamin C plus 1 gram calcium or placebo. They do not lose any bone during the first two years of treatment. However, after three months, they have no significant change in total body bone material content. This study determines whether long-term cedarate will prevent bone losses in Japanese women without Ost"
30746868,"This study aims to prospectively compare the results of robotic-arm assisted total hip replacement and conventional manual arthroscopic surgery. The United State study is controlled, and randomed with 136 patients at three centers; the Length Of Stay Also was not different, but theSurgical Time and Blood Loss were greater inthe control group. Other complications also were comparable with traditional techniques. In addition, there was no difference in hip scores or short form health survey outcomes. Both groups had significant functional impairments. However, they did have significant differences in abductor functions. They also showed that the use of robot milling resulted in improved bone remodeling. A further study was performed to assess the effects of this technology on the accuracy for short famoral stem positioning."
31933471,"The results of this study indicate that women have a lower risk of developing atrial fibrillation than men. However, the quality of life and treatment of these patients differs. In particular, there is no difference in the severity of the effects of attrital fibrillation on qualityof life. A new device called the MyDIAgnostick has been developed to help detect such conditions."
27395329,"The aim of this study is to determine whether the effects of four different nutrients on children's growth, morbidness, and mental function are associated with the use of fortification in school lunches. This intervention has no significant effect upon anthropometric measurements over 31 days but reduces the incidence of asthma-related illnesses. In addition, the treatment results in improvements in the quality of blood, iron, ferritin, urinary odine, hemoglobin concentrations, as well as changes in brain function. Children receive more than one hundred milligrams of iodin per day; however, they show little improvement in their performance on tests of information processing, working memory, visual problemsolving, or fine motor skills."
10796331,"In this study, we examine the effects of a combined combination of calcium and 1,25-hydroxyvintin D3 on hip bone loss in elderly women. The treatment group is better than the placebo group at maintaining bone mineral densesities. We also compare the effect of different doses for improving muscle strength in patients with aging. All three groups differ significantly from each other at the spine: 1) estrogen replacement therapy; 2) estrogen replacement intervention; and 3) calcitario therapy. This study concludes that all three treatments are highly effective in treating older women who have normal bone mass. A double blind trial was conducted to evaluate the safety of an extended regimen of vitamin D and CaCliferol. After two years, no significant changes occurred in body mineral Density. Two hundred eighty men and women were entered into another doubleblind trial. Serum cacerinine concentrations before the trial were 24.1 mol/L as the subjects living independently received only 12.6 nmol per day. Both groups were assigned into trial or control groups. Four hundred ninety five healthy people aged 41 were followed for additional two yrs during which no studies were given. They were divided into four groups according to their age. Bone Mineral Dension Measures were measured by Dual-Energy X-Ray absorpatiometry. Biochemical Variations related to Calcium metabolism and Bon turnover were calculated. No differences between serum 25-HhD levels were seen. An ongoing long-term follow up was being undertaken to assess the recurring fracture rate and safe profile associated with Low-dose calitriol vs."" At their 1- year anniversary of participation, CT women could be further mized into ""the calcium"" and vitamin C trial component,"" which is expected to include 4,500 women"
28332506,"The results of this study suggest that telemedicine can improve blood pressure in primary care patients with uncontrollable systelic hypertension. In addition, the number of phone calls per month is associated with social functioning, vitality, and mental health. This study also suggests that weight loss may be an effective intervention for improving blood control in overweight or obese patients. A pilot study was performed to evaluate the effects of short-mesages-based communication on blood tension control over 12 weeks in postmenopatras with abdominal obesity. Results showed significant reduction in mean pulse pressure among the intervention group as well as improvement in other outcomes. Further studies were conducted to determine whether ""home-centered monitoring"" could reduce patient risk of heart attack by using short messages sent by a cell phone and the web. These studies found no difference in bloodpressure control between the two groups."
28249299,"This is a first-in-man study to determine the effects of exercise on body weight and blood lipid levels in overweight women. The subjects were divided into three groups: aerobic exercise, resistance training, and control group. After 8 weeks, they lost 5.3 percent of their weight with the exercise group losing 2.8 percent. In this study, we examine the effect that exercise training has on inflammatory markers, oxidative stresses, leptenin,and other body fat mass in obese children. We found no significant differences between mean change in Leptin at baseline and after 9 weeks of physical training. However, there was large variation in individual response. Finally, it was concluded that an eight-week exercise program would be sufficient to prevent or delay osphagus development in males who had Barrett's ostomy."
25879093,"After 24 weeks, the frequency of sexual episodes in the group that received 300mg of testosterone increased significantly. In contrast, those receiving placebo did not receive any improvement in their sexual function. A sub-group of women followed for another year. The results showed a greater increase in satisfaction at four weeks' time in both groups than in either group. Women who received only 100mcgs of dehydromepi or rosterone experienced no significant changes in body weight and were more likely to experience vasomobility symptoms. This study was designed to examine the effects of an acute dehoepis and rosteron treatment on female sexual dysfunction. It was found that this treatment improved all domainof female Sexual Dysfunctities. For example, Dhea had been shown to improve all three of these domains: desire/interest, pain at sexual activities, and fatigue. Furthermore, it has been observed that there is little change in quality of life after 12 weeks of therapy. However, safety issues were also investigated. These included hot Flashes, blood lipid levels, insulin resistance, etc."
24464831,"The French-Languistic Society of Papediatric Anaesthemsiologists, ADREF, conducts a one-year prospective study on the effects of local anesthesia on infants. In this paper, we examine the effect of general and spine anesis on short-term outcomes of newborns who have elective cesaren section. There is little difference in postocular morbidity among the two groups; however, there is significant differences in blood loss and length of patient stay. Postoperative complications are similar in both groups. All patients receive morphine for pain relief but no major side effects. After total hip replacement, all patients undergo spinal analysis with either epidal or intrathecy. This results in improved recovery after total knee surgery. Epidual analgesies reduce the risk of convalescing during the first few days of the operation. However, they do not result in improvement in mental status. These studies also suggest that some types of patients may benefit from epidical analsia."
24513112,"This study aims to compare the results of two different pulpotomic techniques, formocre sol and ferric silfate, on teeth with no direct contact to the vital pulp. The success of both treatments is similar, but there is a slight difference in the success rate between the two treatment groups. In addition, the failure rate for either technique is significantly lower than that of the other methods."
29498201,"The results of this trial confirm that weekly cisolate is safe for patients with head and neck malignant squampous cell carcinoma. In addition, it shows that CRT has superior efficacy to resection alone in terms of survival. A retrospective review of the Italian cohort showed that per cycle toxicity was more likely to be associated with grade 3 to 4 tumor sensitivity than with febrile neutronia. This study also suggests that higher doses may be required for early-stage colon cancer."
24406123,"This paper focuses on the use of shoulder pain-related sick leave as an outcome measure in primary care. It uses a novel prediction rule that predicts the risk of injury for individual workers during their first consultation. The results suggest that this prediction model is accurate and can be used to predict the severity of patients' shoulder symptoms. In addition, it has been reported that there are several prognostics measures for poor shoulder function, but no comprehensive evidence exists regarding them. A patient-reported shoulder score, the Oxford shoulder scale, was introduced 10 years ago; however, its popularity has grown rapidly since then. Some recommendations have been made about how to use the score in future trials. All patients with shoulder problems between 20 and64 years of age were included in this study. They were divided into five subcategories: pain, daily activities, recreational and Athletic activities/work, satisfaction, and areas where improvement could be made. These qualities would make it useful for the prospect ""i ve assess the outcome of treating disorders related tothe shoulder""."
28196512,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates the efficacy and safety of a weight loss intervention for people with schizophrenia. After six months, the patients lose an average of five pounds in the sat group and gain an additional two pounds after three months. This suggests that the treatment may be more effective than other approaches. The results of the study indicate that there are no significant changes in body weight or waist circumference between the two groups. Although the overall risk of mortality is higher relative to the population, it is not entirely clear whether these differences are due to disease or lifestyle factors. However, some patients show improvements in their BMI and waist-circference. Aripisprazole treatment does not improve blood pressure or heart function. There is also evidence that cloza pine therapy may reduce metabolic risks associated with steroid treatment."
27738515,"In this study, we examine the efficacy of a single pill strategy for improving adherence to statins in patients with mild-to-diseased heart disease. We conclude that it is possible to increase relapses after stroke by using an intervention consisting of multiple daily doses of antiplatelet, blockers, and angiotenson-converting enzyme-inhibitors. The results suggest that full prescription drug regimens may be more cost effective than other approaches for reducing blood pressure andcholestrolemia in high-burden countries."
22041335,"PVI significantly improves LV function in patients who have a history of heart failure. After follow-up, the odds ratio for improved survival is 0.51, with no difference in eject fraction or quality of life after 16 months. The results of this study suggest that ablation may be an effective treatment for patients with symptomatic left ventricular fiasco. In addition, it has been reported that only acei can be used to treat AF. A control group of patients was selected because of their high risk of mortality and severe left ventric dysfunction. They were randomed to rhythm control or continued medical therapy. Although rate control did not improve valgusal function, RFA did lead to improvements in cardiac function. This study aims to evaluate the effect of catheter Ablation on atrial fibrilation. It showed significant improvement in Left Ventricular Fillation in depressed vs normal femotypes. At 6 months, there was marked increase in right venous function as compared to those treated by conventional methods."
23219100,"In this paper, we describe the results of a two-year observational study on pre-primertal children. The primary outcome was that boys who walked to school consistently had lower body mass than those who did not walk or cycled. We also examined the association between physical activity and other measures of health, such as height and weight. Our main aim was to determine whether overweight and middle-aged children are more physically active when compared to their normal weight peers. This is an important finding because it suggests that there may be some relationship between high-quality physical activities and higher levels of general health."
26546969,"In this study, we examine the efficacy of pravastain as an anti-seizure agent in asymptomatic young women with hypercholestrolemia. After 24 weeks, there is no evidence of any reduction in exercise capacity or cortosol or catechoamine responses. The results suggest that simva statin may have some negative effects on mood during stress events. A doubleblind, randomed placebo controlled trial investigates the effect of vastin on blood concentrations of all steroid Hormones and Estradiol. There is not significant change in total cholesterol, low density Lipoprotein, and TTriglyceride levels. This study concludes that pruvastatin can be used to prevent heart attack in patients with high-cholesterol status. It has been reported that it can reduce the risk of dying from coronary disease or stroke by inhibiting the intermembrance of C1H1 and CD54 at the cell level."
23796797,"In this paper, we examine the association between genetic variants involved in mu-opiomed receptor-interacting proteins such as ARRB1 and Hin1. We find no significant association for either genotype at either end or 6-month intervals. Furthermore, our study finds that HINT1 allele is associated with higher risk of abstention after smoking cessations. This may be due to the fact that the participants are drug free during these time periods. Further evidence suggests that there may also be a role for certain genes in smoking behavior. For example, several studies have found that one or more copy of the Taq1 Allele can lead to an increase in the likelihood of quitting smoking. These results suggest that some other important molecular traits may play influencing smoking response."
27727432,"The results of this study suggest that the use of sadenosoline, an over-the-counter drug, may be an effective treatment for mild to moderate depression in patients who are not depressed. Although there is no significant effect on blood levels of histamine or carnirine, these results do not seem to have any significant effects on either group. A sub-study of adults with major depressant disorder was recruited from April 13, 2005 to December 22, 2009, at the Boston General Hospital and Butler Hospital respectively. In addition, it has been reported that S-adrenosel methione appears to be more effective than placebo in treating Major Depressive disorder."
30455832,"The safety and efficacy of a new approach to treating patients with atrium fibrillation has been reported. In this study, we enrolled 207 patients who had recent-onset acute atrial fibrillation or frolicking. We found that the treatment of these patients was safe and well tolerated. A total of 13 patients were excluded from the study because of their pre-existing heart disease or other medical conditions. All patients received an appropriate dose of procainamibilide in order to prevent further complications. Out of those patients, only six failed cardioversion. Thirty-five patients completed the procedure. Sixtiously, thirty-seven cases were studied. This practice guideline was established for the care of patients suffering from atary fibriliation. It was recommended that patients be treated with either direct current or wait-and-watch therapy. No significant morbidities occurred; however, no mortality or significant Morbidity occurred. For patients not treated according to ""the multidisciplinary pathway"" for which propaftenone was used, there was reduced rate of hospitalization. An observational pilot study was conducted on 100 consecutive patients receiving convalescent care after they had successfully managed their attriotic condition. After follow-up, patient satisfaction was improved by increased frequency of symptoms during the first three months of treatment."
28477308,"In this paper, we present the results of a number of different studies on the benefits of exercise for patients after myomyosm. The most important finding is that there is no significant difference in sudden death between the two groups. For example, one group has an odds ratio of 2 to 5 and the other group only 1 or 2. This study tests the hypothesis that vigorous multiple risk factor decline over four years would significantly reduced the rate of progress of atheroseclerosis in the chest arteries of people and women who were assigned to usual-care or multifactorrisk reduction. A total of 773 patients were randomized to either outpatient care or home-based care. After three months, the improvement was much smaller in middle aged and older persons but smaller than in very old individuals. Another study compares the effects of ""home-base"" and ""outpatient"" care on blood pressure, body mass, and physical function. Both groups showed improvements in their health-related life scores. They also showed improved performance in heart rate, blood fat, lipoprotein level, as well as quality of life. These results indicate that postmenostopausals can make lasting changes; and that these change may reduce the needs for cardiac medication and improve risk factors andquality of living. However, after 6 years of mixed-factorial risk treatment, there seems to be persistent improvement in Lipophosphoryl levels and bodily capacity which results in retardation of diseases progression."
11574449,"Four articles discuss the use of controlled trials in practice. The first is a review of four articles that have been published since the beginning of the twentieth century. In one article, it was reported that patients receiving control of their disease were improved by using ""the Computer-Altered Management Protocol"" to manage their condition. Another article reports that there are no significant differences between the three forms of care for patients with diabetes: general practitioner care, shared care between two doctors, and conventional care. This study compares three types of follow-up: 1) general practitioners care; 2) 'a system of Care shared between General Physicians and Consultations'; and 3) an integrated care model. After nine months, blood pressure improves significantly in both groups. A further study examines the effect of integrating care into regular routines for adults with Type 2 diabetes. Although this approach does not lead to improvement in patient health, several studies have suggested that it may be useful for physicians to train their staff on how to effectively treat patients who have type 2 or other serious medical conditions."
17846060,"In this study, we examine the risk of stroke in patients with intermittent atrial fibrilation who receive aspirin. We find that those with a sustained AF have fewer strokes than those without thrombosis. Although there is little known about the danger of sudden ischemic or fatal stroke after aspidin treatment, our results suggest that warfarin may be an effective treatment for these patients."
26501062,"In this study, we examine the performance of a risk estimation system that uses the patient's pain perception scale and the Low Back Perception Score as predictors. The results suggest that patients who receive an early intervention for low back pain have better outcomes than those who do not receive such treatment. This paper also describes the use of ""mini-intervention"" to reduce daily pain symptoms and sick leave without increasing health costs. A cluster-randolf and Omised control educational trial is used to assess the efficacy of small intervention strategies in treating patients with chronic lowback pain. After follow-up, no subjects had daily painful pain in groups A or B than in group C; P 0.002; G vs"
26725071,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective, open-label, random-experimentation study on two hundred twenty boys with pymosis who received either topical or placebo creams. After six months, all patients in the treatment group completed the two treatments without interruption. The efficacy was found in 65.8% of cases in both groups. A further study is performed to determine whether topicals can be used as an effective treatment for children with paediatric disease. This study involves two groups of 40 boys aged 4.1 years old and 20 boys age 3 - 6. They are treated with topically steroid cream twice daily. Both groups show significant improvement in their condition within 2 months. We suggest that they should use stretching exercises to prevent circumcision."
25300397,"In this study, we examine the performance of patient-specified instruments in total knee aoroplasty. The results suggest that these newer devices may be more accurate and less reliant on surgeons' preference for specific instrumentation. However, there is no significant improvement in the accuracy or reproducibility of the component positioning of patients treated with PSI compared to conventional instruments."
30293906,"In this study, the effects of combination therapy with a mixture of tansulosesin and mirascabegron on men with moderately to severe lower Urinary tract symptoms are examined. The combined treatment is superior to either monotherapy in terms of improving quality of life during four years. A double- blinded 12 week phase 3 study was conducted in 1334 patients with over active bladder who were subject to mild to serious storage symptoms and ""voiding symptoms."" Both groups improved their efficacy by improving the severity of each patient's urinary symptoms. Menstrual dysfunction increased at 1 year for women who had been continent at baseline. This study also included an investigation into the safety and effectiveness of alfuzon and soLifenacin in treating benign prostatichyplusa. It was found that there was no significant difference in the rate of repeat acute Urgency Retention after one month or three month follow up period. However, both groups showed improvement in other measures such as urine flow rate and time of residual urine volume. These changes were not observed in any particular way. Furthermore, they did not show any significant differences between treatments for satisfying dosing nor side effects. Finally, it was concluded that alphablockers and 5alphareductaze inhibitors were medical treatments that were being used as alternative to surgical intervention"
32149404,"The results of the first three years of follow-up in a cohort of 163 children who undergone complex heart surgery are described. In particular, the treatment group has lower scores on motor function and oromotion than the control group; however, they have more severe speech defects at all times. Brain structure abnormalities are also seen in patients with congeniital heart defects. Children with open heart surgeries tend to have worse neurocognital and brain development outcomes than those with conventional surgical techniques."
23360949,"In this first study, we examine the efficability of individualized neurofeedback for children with attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity disorder. Parents report significant improvements in their child's behavior when they receive either active or passive attention-monitoring training. Children who receive both treatment show significant reductions on symptoms but do not show any improvement in other measures. A second study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of combined parent-child training as an intervention for patients with ADHD. The results suggest that parents may be more effective than those given only community care; however, there is no evidence that these two approaches work. For example, one study suggests that using a combination of parental training and self-control training can lead to improved behavior in children without having to resort to medication. Another study reports that ""parental training"" does not reduce the severity of symptoms in adults with mild-to-mid-thirties disease. However, it does improve some of the symptoms of adulthood."
27489205,"In this paper, the results of a three-year observational study are presented. The cumulative survival rate for primary morals treated with amalgam or traumatic restoration is reported. There was no significant difference in the overall survival rates of single- surface restorations and multiple-surface replacements over an extended period of time. Both treatments have higher survival times than multiple surfaces. A higher percentage of failures due to mechanical reasons were caused by secondary caries. This study also focuses on the long-lasting performance of conventional glass-Ionomer composite resin Dyract as compared to other materials used in primary teeth. It is concluded that  trauma-restorative treatment is more cost- effective than conventional restourative methods."
22992251,"The results of this study suggest that maternal consumption of n-3) fatty acids during the first half of pregnancy reduces the risk of nonsydrocole in infants. However, there is no evidence for a protective effect from these folic alpha-regulfing chemicals on placental growth. In contrast, women who begin using multivitins after pregnancy are at least twice as likely to have limb defects."
29453672,"In this study, we investigate the effects of fish oil on adonoses and atherogen markers in type 2 diabetes patients. We find that rats fed the ""SF"" diet have greater leptiin concentration than rats treated with the control oil group. This suggests that fat mass is inappropriately high in both groups for an appropriate amount of time. The results suggest that consumption of omega-3 fats improves blood lipid levels in Type 2 diabetic patients but are not as beneficial to their health as other forms of fat-soluble fatty acids."
28063111,"In this large, prospective, controlled study, we demonstrate non-inferiovity of cryoblation against rfa for treating patients who have paroxysmal atrial fibrilation. We also compare the safety and success of two different methods of ablation for patients suffering from acute fist pain. The first is using a balloon to perform ""touch-up"" osential cryostablation in patients with severe atrium fibrillation; the second uses an electric catheter as an electrode to ablate blood into the veins. Both methods lead to similar results in terms of long-term freedom from atarrhythmic medication."
30627080,"In this study, we examine the association between low-respective physical activity and risk of cardiovascular disease in adults. We find that men with low levels of fitness are at a higher risk for both short-term and long- term events, particularly for those with high blood pressure. Furthermore, our results suggest that black and white young men who engage in moderate to vigorous exercise are likely to be fit and healthy."
26912127,"In this paper, the authors describe the efficaciousness of haloperol in treating asymptomatic patients with acute mental disorder. They compare the use of either 5 or 10mg per day for immediate control of symptoms and assess the severity of each patient's behavior over time using the Becky-Imperiatric Rating scale. Acutely psychotic subjects were assigned on double blinded basis to receiving either five or 10, mg per days of fluntrazepum during an aggressive incident. The results suggest that these two regimens seem comparable; however, they are not necessarily effective. Most patients have nonpsychiatary triage complaint, drug/ alcohol use, severe mania, and anxiety. All patients had significant improvement from baseline to final visit. Thirty six adults who met two of six establishedclusion criteria for high violent risk and sensitivity of illness were observed for at least 28 days. This study was based on repeated measures methodology. Both groups improved significantly: PANSS EXICIED Component score increased significantly after 5 days; Lithium treated patients improved considerably than placebo; and quetiappe combined with both Li or DvVP has superiorefficacy as compared with other antipsychotic treatments. Adverse events were noted within 24 hours After the intervention, using selection items from the UgvalG Klinisk undersgelsers side effect scale."" Although clinical practice advocates the treatment of several drugs -- including promethazines, Hlp, PMZ, halopridola -- there are still few controlled studies concerning the effects of different agents that induce tranquility. For example, Quetitia pine is superior to lazepam when it is used alone because of its rapid action. However, some studies have suggested that paramuscular injections may be more effective than parenteral ones. These studies also include comparisons between alphamorphine and midasolam for the managementof acute agitations in patients suffering from schizophrenia. Alphapotene produces greater changes in the Positive And Negative Syndrome Score by 2 hours after their first dose. Other studies indicate that suicide occurs after 14 years of disease. Suicide tends to occur after about 14 months of duration. There are many options available for improving health in older people with dementia.

Eight of them fulfill the 1990 international headache society's classification for cerviogenic headache. In this study, we examine the frequency of headache episodes and their severity by using a validated hand-effacing test. The results indicate that there is less range of neck flexion and extension when compared with the other subjects in the migraine group. There are also more painful upper neck joint dysfunctions measured by manual examination. This study suggests that kinesicotherapy may be an effective treatment for these patients."

In patients with BPH, the mean improvement in the Urodynamic Measures of Prostatic Dysfunction was not significantly affected by baseline symptoms or PSA categories. Furthermore, no significant changes were seen in either the IIEF domain or the IVD domain. Tadalsuloshin did not lead to significant improvements in these measures."
24307487,"In this study, we examine the effect on walking distance in patients with persistent claudicious disease who are treated with either metoproll or ramipriml. The results suggest that these two drugs may be useful for treating hypertensives suffering from intermittent paddling. A double blinded crossover trial is carried out in which 28 patients were divided into two groups and each group was given one capsule of metorolol per day. After 48 weeks, ankle-brachial index andabsolute knee bending distance improved greatly in both groups. Both treatment groups had no significant differences across treatments. They also showed no difference in the time to pain free walk distance. This study investigates the effects of celipriolole on large-artificial stiffness in peripheral arterial diseases. It shows that it reduces blood pressure more effectively than amladipine but does not increase the risk of heart failure. These studies furthermore show that angiotensol-converting enzyme blocker can be used as a preventive measure against cardiovascular events."
29474713,"After six months of follow-up, the mean adherence to prescribed statins is compared among patients who received short message service, via short word service and micro letter or via phone alone. This study compares the efficacy of two different approaches for improving blood pressure control in patients with acute coronary disease: 1) an intervention that delivered messages via a smartphone was able to improve medication regimens; and 2) an incentive-based approach was used to determine which group of patients would benefit most from the intervention. In this paper, we examine the effect of ""mobility-mhoned"" self-management systems on improving patient fidelity to treatment. The results are similar to those seen in other studies, including lower blood levels and greater frequency of missed doses."
26225902,"In this paper, the authors report that munlessepristone, a potent antipsychotic, produces significantly higher response than placebo in patients suffering from major depression. The mean reduction of Hamilton Rating Score for depression is significantly larger in imipramine than in fluoxamine group. This suggests that short- term use of glucotonicoid antagonists might be more effective in treating major depressives. A recent study reports that treatment with amitraline or perphenaziine does not lead to significant improvement in symptoms when compared to standard treatment. However, there are some confounding effects on the outcome: resistance to serotonein relapse inhibitors or monoamine oxinase inhibits do not seem to predict poorer outcome."
27113121,"In this study, we examine whether vitamins B6, B12, folicace and zinc improve response to treatment for major depression over 52 weeks. The results are that the risk of relapse is lower in the vitamin groups than placebo. We also assess severity of symptoms using the Montgomery-Sberg Depression Rating scale. A double blinded randozed clinical trial of chlorimipramin combined with L 5-Hitp 300mg/day was conducted in 60 patients who were not depressed but had other serious medical conditions. This study was supported by the fact that no significant differences were observed between the two groups at later points."
26626069,"A cluster-randomed control trial is used to assess the effect of a walk-to-school program on student travel. The results show that students in the intervention group are more likely to walk to school than they are in controls. In contrast, the control group has no significant differences in step counts amongst themselves or among other students. This suggests that there may be an advantage in using self-regular strategies to increase physical activity for young children."
30462233,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of 14 patients who had undergone ICD therapy. They report that during an average follow up of 1.4 Years, ""high-rate therapy"" and delayed Icd therapy were associated with reduced first occurrences of inappropriate therapy as compared to conventional device programming. Conclusions These results are important mechanist information indicating that worsened clinical condition and cardinal instability are subsequently associated with an increase in risk for appropriately IC therapy -- for ventricular throngs or death -- and that these changes are related to the severity of the patient's heart failure. The German DeVice registry shows that patients with severe heart failing have more comorbidity than those with normal heart function."
21901722,"Major care reforms are being introduced in England, including financial incentive to improve quality of care. Most scores were significant higher for the Chronic illness sample's than for other samples of patients in the same time period. This paper describes a cross sectional design study that examines the impact of financial incentives on patient satisfaction, access to care, and frequency of visits to quit smoking. The results indicate that payment for services is cost-effective when compared with those offered by general practitioners in Germany. Physicians who have been very engaged in quality improvement practices tend to be more frequently referred to as quitlines. A pay-per-promotion program increases the number of tobacco cessation visits among physicians who are not currently involved in high-quality improvement activities. In addition, these physicians receive an additional bonus or enhanced feefor service from their patients. Coverage was determined from all sources; this resulted in increased numbers of immunizing patients within the control condition. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two experimental conditions."

They find that there is a high proportion of hypovitaminisis D in these women over 50 years and that most of the women have low levels of vitamin D at all. The results suggest that adequate sun exposure and fortified dairy products can be used to prevent bone loss."
23126575,"The results of this study suggest that the use of a cement-less stem for total hip replacement is preferable to using an all-porous stem. Although there are no adverse effects on full weight bearing after operation, it does not seem to affect the prognosis of the new prostheses. A hundred consecutive Anatomique Boulogne hip arthrooplastys in 97 were evaluated prospectively with ten years follow-up Time of 4 to 10, 6 years; the mean Merle D'Aubigénie score improved from 9 preoperately to 17.4) at 5 years. There was little improvement in pain and function over the first year. After six years, the average survival rate for the four different components dropped by between 73 percent and 94 percent. In addition, patients with loosening problems had better long-term outcomes than those with cemented stem or noncemented Steerforth. This report describes the outcome of three-year post-survivor studies regarding the performance of single-celent stem fixation. It also reports that although the surgeons who performed the entire procedure did not perform as well as the general surgeon, their practice surveillance has been used as he/she would have liked."
32322969,"The aim of the study was to determine whether symodbiotics can be used as an anti-inflammatory drug in patients with tidbits of disease. In this trial, 66 patients received either a BifiDobacterium Longum or lifestyle modification and were divided into four groups. After two weeks, subjects were assigned to consume one type of bread, one probiotic, or one control bread. No significant effects were seen on blood phosphorus levels; however, no significant change was seen in the control group. This study is designed to evaluate the effect of prebiotic consumption on weight loss in elderly patients. It was found that both groups had significant reductions in body weight and total fat mass. However, they showed significant changes in steatopsis and other liver functions."

The results suggest that daily dosages of vitamin D may improve athletic performance and reduce injury. We conclude that these studies are important for understanding the effects of both physical and mental training. A double-blindend, placebo-control trial is designed to determine whether or not daily amounts of either 1,500 IU./day or 1,800 m.i.D. can be used as an effective preventative measure against acute disease."

Apolipoproproteins are also reduced. After two months, however, there is no significant change in other markers of inflammation. Consuming fish oils does not reduce arterial stiffness among Latino subjects with hypertension. This study was designed to investigate whether consumption of coconut oil or a combination of it would improve health. It showed that both diets had similar effects on heart failure. However, after eight weeks, the results were not different."
27611008,"In this study, we compare the effects of a single dose of sildenalfil to those of an eight-week regimen in men with severe Erectile Dysfunction. The results suggest that treatment with dandy will be more effective than placebo in improving erectility after radical retropubicic surgery. Tadallafil is most effective on patients with mild to moderate ED following nsrp and suggests that it may protect from penile changes. Avanaf is safe and efficacious for treating adult males who have recurrent obstructive or acute urgatory after nerve sparring radical prostatutes. After four weeks, there are significant increases in Sept2 and Sexe 3 and change in Mean IIEF-F domain score with 200 and 200mg tadasalafil as compared to placebo. This was followed by another double blinded, placebo-controlled multi-centre study wherein all patients were assigned to receive either 100 or 200 milligrams vardenalifil. Both studies were well tolerated and showed good patient satisfaction."

They conclude that there is no significant difference in pre- or post-confussion symptoms between African Americans and white high school students. Athlettes demonstrate similar performance on Immediate Prior Post-Concursion Assessment Cognitive test as well as differences in response to fMRI. This study furthermore examines the relationship between corroborated neurocognition and recovery after conjussion. The results of this study suggest that early brain recovery may be delayed because of risk factors such as age, skull fracture, and posttraumatic nausea."

The results showed no difference in morbidity between the two groups. Several patients were studied for epitomes of endomymetritis; eighteen vagilially delivered women developed late post partum endogenitis seven to42 days after delivery. Prophylactic antibiotic regimens were used as prophylaxes in these patients. However, they had less wound infection and a shorter hospital stay than those who received their anticipatory treatment. Postcesarean delivery with extended-spectrum ampicillin was associated with reduction in postpartum disease. This study population was 55 % black, 25.5 years of age, and 43 percent nullipparous.

26120361,"This pilot study establishes that children with anxiety disorders are willing to be randomed and run in parallel for seven weeks. The outcome measures are acceptable, the content of the group is feasible within the United Kingdom, and the intervention is appreciated by families. Children with high-functionaling anxiety disorder complete 16 sessions of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy with their parents. Both transfer-of control and parental anxious management techniques significantly contribute to improved clinician and parent scores of childglobal functioning withinFCBT. In this study, we examined the efficaciousness of a Modified Cockpit-based treatment for anxiety among young people with ASD who were not at risk of severe anxiety. We found that both treatments produced significant reductions in symptoms of anxiety; however, more responders than waitlist groups did not show any difference in severity after two months. Our purpose was to evaluate an alternative version of Coping Cat's program for treating patients with moderate-to-high-functioning autistic disorder. Twenty-four children aged 8 to 14 years old were assigned to either immediate treatment or waitinglist comparison group. These results indicate that the experimentation, parent training, school consultation, as well as multiple treatment components designed to accompanies the social and adaptable skill deficiencies of children With Autism Spectrum Disorder that could pose barrier to anxiety reduction. After three month follow-up, they showed significant decreases on parent-re reported anxiety symptoms at pre-treatment and post-waitlist levels. At follow up, these results suggest that factors such as frequent sessions in "
25721432,"In this study, we examine the impact of a tablet-based balance training program on gait performance and fall risk in older adults. We compare two groups: one group is assigned to an outpatient treatment setting; the other group receives 12, 30 minute sessions delivered one-onone over four- six weeks in anoutpatient therapy setting. The results show that the tablet group's gaits are improved under single task conditions while the brochure group has no significant differences. Both groups receive 12 minutes per day for their exercises. A single-blinded trial will consist of 44 individuals within twelve months of stroke. Fes-I does not change significantly in the control group but falls do not improve. After 12 days, the effect seems to be increased with walking speed at fast speeds or cadence during dual task tasks. This study also shows that both groups have similar effects on postural reserve as well as physical function. It concludes that ""this balancetraining program, including twin-and multi-task,"" improves fall related selfefficacy, Gait speed, balance performance, and physical functions in elderly people with osteopororosis. Although many studies confirm positive effects of cognitive and physically training on older adult health, few studies have examined the benefits of simultaneously performed mental and bodily training. One group includes dance video games, which reduces stride length by reducing the step-To-step variability between the two sets of steps. Another study focuses on improving balance among older patients with knee Osteoartritis. Elderly subjects receive twice weekly cognitive motor exercise that includes progressive strength/balance training and dance-video gaming. Walking speed is measured using an automaticity score. There are significant improvements in walk speed after completion of the intervention. Furthermore, there are changes in total and highdensity muscles cross sectional area. Functional status is assessed before measures with the barthel Index. These studies were conducted in three different groups -- the first group received only traditional physical exercise and the second group included dance entertainment. They all showed improvement in balance and mobility when they completed the program. However, these studies did not show any significant difference in functional status. Finally, another study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of double-tasked balance movements in healthy older men with aging shoulder injuries. Two trials were carried out in Swedish communities. First, it found that age-related declines were reduced in those who had been trained to move more quickly than usual"
28236962,"A novel lifestyle intervention for type two diabetes is presented in this first-year study. The main outcome measures are weight loss, body mass index, blood pressure, and psychological distress. In the second year, the results show a significant improvement in fasting glucose, insulin resistance, Body Mass Index, as well as waist circumference and body weight. After three months, both groups receive health counseling and follow- up visits. Both groups lose their weight at different intervals. They also have greater changes in high-dental lipoprotein content than control subjects. This trial compares group-based diet and exercise delivery by the Young Medical Care Association to brief counsel alone in adults who attend 'disease risk-screenping events' at two semi- urban ymca facilities. Although only two of these two matched sites can adjust for possible clustering by location, it is not possible to adjustment for potential clustered by site."
27595415,"In this study, we examine the effects of pre- and post-conceptional vitamin D on asthma in pregnant women. We find that those who receive a higher amount of daily doses have an increased risk of experiencing colds than those with lower levels. This is due to the fact that they are more likely to be wheezed during pregnancy. Pregnaned women were divided into two groups: one group was assigned to receive 1,000 iug/day; the other group received only placebo. The results of the studies indicate that there is no significant relationship between blood levels and severity of asthma attacks over the course of four years. A pilot study was performed to determine whether combined effect of vitamins D and omega 3 polyunstained fatty acid could prevent the developmentof asthma and allergic reactions in children. Results showed that 30 ng VD-3000 was sufficient to prevent asthma from developing as well as reduce the odds of receiving an emergency department visit for at least 4 years after birth."
29659440,This study focuses on the association between low-back pain and school-based measures of pain severity. A pooled cross-sectional analysis of 50 students with low back pain indicates that there is good confounding evidence for the validity of this measure.
23506544,"This paper focuses on the effects of an energy balance intervention for recent retires. The results indicate that physical activity and exercise are associated with increased weight gain in men and women who have recently retired. In addition, changes in lifestyle behavior from preretirment to post-retirement are analysed with simultaneously increases in body weight. A one year low intensity energy balanced program is used to prevent accumulationof abdominal fat mass by increasing awareness ""of energetic balance."" It is shown that this program has a significant effect at six, twelve, and 24 months. At these intervals, there is no significant between group-disferences; however, it does not seem to be as effective as other approaches. For example, among participants who report high confidant/emotionally support, they are more likely to maintain recommended levels of long-term physical activeness. Furthermore, those who experience high practical support are also more highly likely than others to report recommended level of Long-Term Physicalactiveness at follow- up. Further evidence suggests that emotional support may help individuals maintain the recommended amount of Lentative Walking Per Day. However, patients with higher age, lower body Mass Index, or higher intention are unresponsive to such measures. These findings suggest further evidence that emotional support from the nearest person may improve the individual's health."
24879789,"In this single-arm, rat-controlled study, we find that ablation of the venerable ventricular fist using a pentaray catheter reduces the incidence of myomyocardial shocks in patients with scarred VT. We conclude that these patients can be safely ablined with rapes or pulsed electric currents after only two to three procedures. The results suggest that an advanced approach of catheter ablate may be more cost effective than conventional methods for treating thrombotic heart disease."
22513945,"In a multicentre, prospect ive ve v, controlled r and Omized trial, we compare the symptoms and quality-of-life of patients with atrium fibrillation. At three months, the same seven SF- 36 scales are significantly higher in the Ablation group than that of the Adling group; however, symptom frequency and severity score were significantly reduced. The results suggest that ablation is superior to second-line therapy in patients who have paroxysal or persistent atrial fillation because they do not require additional drugs for their maintenance. This study also examines the effect of electrodes placed on the left attic wall as an alternative treatment for patients suffering from parosmal arrhythmian disease. It was reported that this approach improved the cure rate by reducing the incidence of interferential pulmonary vein isolated by PV isolation. Furthermore, it has been shown that circumferent pulmonary vein separation can be more effective than segmental plenial vein isolation when used alone. However, these two approaches have different advantages: first, there is no need for antiarctic drugs; second, although some patients may suffer thrombosis, most patients experience no relapse of attriotic drug use after ablating either method. Finally, several studies have examined the efficaciousness of both methods in treating acutely agitated patients. For example, one study showed that transvenous crystalloid could reduce the risk of postcoronary heart failure but did not improve the safety of any particular regimen."
28851509,"In this study, we examine the results of left and right testis volume after 1 year in a group of healthy young men. The treatment group has better results than the untreated control group. We also find that there is no association between age and severity of the disease. A prospective observational study was performed on 88 patients with an initial poor testicular molecular condition. After follow-up, both groups showed similar results. Both groups had different results in their sperm quality. They were divided into two groups: ""normal"" and ""abnormal."" This study compares the performance of laparoscocelectomy with open surgery. It found that the double-port procedure was superior to the single-site operation because it required no special instruments. However, the outcome was not as favorable as the open surgical procedure."
28229164,"In this study, we examine the association between leisure-time physical activity and atrial fibrilation in women. We conclude that lower family income is associated with an elevated risk of occurrence of incident atrium fibrillation after controlling for weight gain and body massindex. After adjusting for age, gender, race, and sexe, our results suggest that there may be a relationship between exercise intensity and increased risk among women who achieve the federal government's recommended 7.5 m.h. per week of ""patriotic"" time. This does not seem to be related to any other atherogen lipoprotein or disease. However, it seems unlikely that these effects are caused by direct cholesterol changes.

The results showed significant improvement in both measures of pain and fatigue, as well as improvements in the Unified Physician's Rating Scale scores. In addition, there was an association between more physical exercise and improved health status in people with this disease. This study also examined whether or not gentle Hatha Yoga might be effective for treating fibromyalsgia. It was found that it was safe and could be used to treat women with breastcancer."
31722229,"In this study, we examine the effect of motivational incentive and MPH in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The results suggest that these two may be useful tools for improving or restoring memory in these children. All children participate in two sessions one week apart. Adolescence is characterised by an inappropriate level of hyperactiveness, impulsiveness and inattention. Eighty-eight children aged between eight and 13 years are individually age-matched with control groups. This indicates that there is an anomalous mechanism for impaired arousals in AD/D. A single dose of caffeine was used in doubleblind placebo controlled repeated measures across-over study. Eyes closed resting electrodeencephalogram were EEG and autonocic data were SCL, heart rate, respiration rates, and spitting blood pressure.

21276215,"This paper focuses on the effects of a Type III fission-sealant sealant, which is used as an anti-caries preventive material in children. It compares two different types of sealants: glass iomer cement and resin-bonded composite materials. The results indicate that both are effective at preventing pits and cracks in the teeth. In particular, they show that one tooth only develops caries after three years of use. However, when compared with other non-repairable fillers, such as fluoride, the effect seems to be even better. A group of patients receive treatment for their first morals from four dentists. After six months, however, there is no difference in how long it takes to remove the sealed product."
29594349,"In this paper, we describe the results of a number of controlled trials that have been published in recent years. The majority of these studies are from older studies with potential report bias and longer follow up periods. We aim to compare the performance of two different types of restorative materials for patients with carious lesions: Quixfil-Ceram posterior composites and Tetric Cram-Alfa scores. Both restorations show good results with high predominate alpha scores; however, both changes are only effects of score shifts from Alpha to Bravo. This study evaluates the efficacy of an ""incremental fill technique"" on posterior teeth using flowable resin material. It is reported that the newer generation Dentinebonding agents show fewer incidence of postopherical sensitivity than early generation dentine bonding agent. A clinical followup is conducted on 329 resin composite replacements made in final year of undergraduate program over three years period. Thirtey-nines percent of the restoreds had no protection layer but increased with depth of cavity restored with the Responsive Composite Material group. Conclusions Postoperative  sensicity in resin veneers was not caused by absence of protectivelayers but increases withthe depth at Cavity restored With the deeper deepest cavities restored it showed remarkably lower incidence Of postoperative sensitiveness than the Early Generation group. Consciety On average, all of those who were treated with bulk fill technology received excellent results during their follow-up time. All of them performed well after four years except for one patient who failed because of Bulburb fracture or partial tooth fracture. Two other dentists used modified USPHCS criteria to assess the relative merits of various treatment approaches. After six months, most of his patients returned with either QuiXfil EvoCceram or Teter Ceram anterior composite restores. They also demonstrated good success with PredominatingAlpha scores within both groups. However, neither change was entirely due to changing scores from Alpha to bravo. Clinical assessment of Stress-bealing Quiixfil and Ttric CerAM posterior reinforcements exhibited Good clinical results without pre dominating alpat scores."" These differences were mostly effects solely of scoring shift between alphosis and brava. Although there was some improvement in marginal discolouration among the two groups, they did not affect each other's scores as much."
30770235,"AMSTAR is a tool for evaluating systematic reviews of rand and ommized trials. It has been used to evaluate systematic Reviews of all kinds of interventions, including long-actable antipsychogen acetylprazole as maintenance treatment in bipolar I disease. The safety and efficacy of AOM 400 are described. In addition, there are few adverse events reported with this drug. For example, weight increase, akathiasis, insomnia, and anxiety. However, the effects observed mostly on manic symptoms were most likely due to mood episode type. Another study was carried out using depot flupenthalixol as an adjournal treatment for patients with biphosphorus disorder. All patients proceeded on Lithium. At the end of the trial, 14 patients improved according to CGI. Perphenazide decanoates were also studied. After six month of treatment, no other side effects occurred or changed in blood chemisty. Bipolar patients received either short-term RLAT or adjunctive placebo. Both regimens significantly delayed their relapse rates. This study involved two cohorts from the systematic treatment Enhancement program for biphobic disorder; they had poor adherence to medication. They included patients who had rapid cycling, suicide attempts, earlier occurrence of illness, alcohol use disorder, or current mental health problems. These patients did not report any nonadherence at follow up visits. Their behavior was inconsistent. There were many confounding factors that could lead to unsatisfaction. Poorly adherent patients had higher number of prior hospitalizations, but reported less previous episodes. Type of treatments were not associated with compliantness. Knowledge of these clinical factors would enrich clinical management"
23737033,"Estrogen therapy improves genital and sexual health in late post-masopal women without previous hormonal treatment. The study is a blind, ivy-blind, placebo-control trial of 48 patients who received either progestine or conjugated estriol during the first three months of their treatment after menopause. Women were assigned to different groups: estrogen alone; progesteron plus medreoxyprogestesterone A/C; and combination regimens. After two years, there was no significant change in quality oflife or sexuality in the combined regimen. In addition, vaginala dryness and trouble sleeping were reported more frequently than in other groups. Hot flushes are reported less frequently by both groups but more frequent symptoms such as breast tenderness at night and vainl discharge. This study concludes that ""combined HRT"" can improve health-related qualities of life for postmenopanal women."
12917933,"In this study, we describe the effects of atenolal on fetalizinololation in pregnancy. The effect is similar to that of placebo. After 10 weeks, there is no difference in blood pressures between the two treatment groups. There are five perinatal death events in both groups; however, after increasing length of treatment, the differences diminish. Both drugs have significant effects on haemostasy parameters. Pregnant women receive either methyl dopa or labetalool during their first three days of pregnancy and they develop significant proteinurication. They also have more frequent side effects than those receiving either drug. All three groups treat pregnant women with severe hypertension as well as those with mild-to-moderate disease. No differences in maternal symptoms can be attributed to any of the treatments. Fetal outcomes differ among the three different groups: for example, patients treated with preeclamprosia had greater risk of premature labor but were not given medication. Women with moderately serious hypertensives received either pindolic or propranolel. Acute complications occurred only in one patient who received an antihyperpentine."

This study aims to evaluate the benefit of iron as Ferric Carboxymaltosese in patients with heart failing. The primary outcome was the self-Reported Patient Global assessment and New York Heart function class at week 24. Both groups showed significant improvement in their performance, fatigue, and overall mood after six weeks of treatment. In this study, FCM significantly improved fatigue and mental quality of life in subjects with low serumferitin concentration. Acute thrombosis occurs over the short term but does not cause major side effects. Intravenous iron loading improves exercise capacity for patients without irondeficiencies."
25605408,"In this paper, we present the results of an eight-week exercise program in a heated swimming pool. The patients are compared to control groups and their performance is reevaluated after four months. A significant improvement in quality of life was found in both groups. Balneothérapie improves the patient's maximal exercise capacity and shoulder abduction as well as improved the performance of his heel lift. Furthermore, there is no difference in the number or duration of repeat episodes in either group. This study compares balniotherapy with topicalcorticosteroid therapy in treating asthma. It has been reported that these two treatments have superior efficacy in terms of improving severity of disease. However, it is not clear whether they can be used for other diseases. For example, studies have suggested use of heat water inhaled inhalations to treat upper airway diseases such as common cold, allergy rhinits, Nonallergic/vasomotor Rhinitis, acute and persistent rhinosinous disorder, and nasal polyposs. These studies were performed by males older than twelve years of age. Thirteen patients were divided into two groups: one group treated with warm vapour irrigations and the other group received normal spouting. Both groups showed improvements in blood flow, gastric motor function, pain relief, etc. They also showed reduction in heart failure symptoms. All patients took 20 minutes baths in 37 degrees C water daily for 10 occasions entirely."

The results indicate that men aged between 65 and 74 years receive lower mortality rates when they are invited to have an immediate assessment of their condition. Men with greater than three-cm in diameter are followed up with repeat scans for at least 4.1 years. This confirms previous studies that there is no significant difference in the number of men who attend one of four different community-based screening programmes. A comparison of age-standing attendance was made between 73 % and 80 p.m., and it was found that participation in these four programs compares favorably with other published studies. Cost effectiveness was determined by calculating the proportion of patients who received an invitation to undergo an abdominal ultrasound examination as opposed to comparing control physicians. Over four months, the mean incremental costs ratio for screening were pound 2840 /pound 15000 to pounds 146000 per life year gain, equivalent to over ounce 36000 P.M."
24847960,"In this paper, we report the results of a large-scale observational study of patients with Parkinson's disease. We examine the association between increased bone mineral density and reduced blood levels of vitamin D as well as the risk of fracture in elderly women. The results suggest that low concentrations of this important mineral may be involved in the pathophysiological consequences of such deficiencies."
18348591,"In this study, we investigate the association between falls and physical activity in older adults. We found that men with reduced levels of physical activities, stroke, arthritis of knees, and increased gait were more likely to fall than those with greater strength. The risk of falls was compared among patients receiving additional exercise or conventional physio therapy. A significant increase in strength was observed in both groups. This is due to the fact that people with lower initial strength are more at risk for falling. Furthermore, there has been no improvement in balance, strength, or quality of life after an eight-month exercise program. Another study suggests that a long term strength training program might be effective in improving health and function in elderly subjects."
21810228,"The results of this study show that the intervention group has a positive effect on function, pain, psychological strains, and return to working rates. In addition, they have an improvement in work-related quality of life. A prospective longitudinal study is conducted to evaluate the effects achieved by these measures in contrast to 'control group' with usual care. This study compares the efficacy of an integrated treatment program for patients with back pain who are not returning to work after their initial injury. The mean duration of work disability was 88 day in the integrated therapy group versus 207 days in control group. However, when compared to the standard care group, the mean length of sick leave was significantly lower than the functional restoration groups. Furthermore, there was no difference in depression at any time during the follow-up period. Finally, it was concluded that using obtrusive medical treatment did not improve depression but improved productivity without increased work stress. Major depression had far-reach consequences for work functions and absenceeism. These conclusions lead to significant increases of indirect costs which can far surpass the medical costs"
22789023,"A randomized, controlled trial comparing the effects of weight loss and physical activity on patients with schizophrenia. In the treatment group, patients gained less weight than they were assigned to routine care during the initial phase of the study. The results suggest that weight gain may be prevented in people with mental illness. However, there is little evidence for the long-term efficacy or safety of this type of treatment."
21203852,"The Compassionate Questionnaire is a good-too-excellent measure for measuring the extent of side effects and other limitations in regular living activities that interfere with quality of life, patient satisfaction, and patient compliance. A prospective cohort of 250 Japanese patients with open-angle or obstructive glaucosis was studied. Although latanomeprost showed greater satisfaction than Bimatoprostasm or Travoprostesn regarding conjunctional hyperaeemia, eye irritation, as well as visual disability, this study does not reveal any significant association between vision-related symptoms and health-of-lives scores."
28640907,"In this study, we examine the relationship between physical activity and risk of developing a heart disease in young Korean boys. After controlling for age, gender, and annual household income, an hour of watching entertainment was associated with the risks of overweight. We use self-reported questions to determine whether or not there are any association between time spent watching leisurely entertainment and blood pressure risk. The results suggest that lifestyle changes may be more beneficial in terms of reducing risk than improving fitness. A quadratic functions of age were used to predict which factors were independent of baseline exercise and changes in body mass over time. Physical activity is best modeled by comparing it to quadratic functions at age 10, increasing until early childhood and declining later in girls. This paper uses observational longitudinal studies to assess health effects on children with asthma. Girls with active asthma have lower moderate-tortureous physical activities than their peers. Children with no asthma report higher levels of activity than those with healthy controls."
25994094,"The results of a prospective, cross-sectional survey of 15,219 French patients with suspected or unrecognized RA is presented. A mean age of 55 years was considered appropriate for the study because of the high prevalence of SpA in France. In addition, some patients had significant disability. Although there are no differences between physical activity and exercise intensity at 24 months, both groups show improved health status. This study aims to evaluate an 8-week patient education intervention designed to increase physical active activity among patients without meting with current treatment recommendations. It does not lead to improvement in quality of life or disease activity."
21109400,"In this paper, we present a method for calculating the proportion of pain responders in four pain-controlled trials. We compare pain intensity and severity at zero, eight, sixteen, thirty- two, forty-two hours after surgery to determine whether analgesis or opioid sparing effects are more effective than other treatments. This method is used to calculate the mean change in pain scores from one patient to another over time. The results indicate that patients receive better pain relief in the treatment groups than they do in control groups. For example, Cbm has no significant difference in perceived pain during the first three weeks after post-surgery. Acupination with clonine does not reduce breakthrough pain on the day following surgery. However, there were no differences between group for all of the variables examined. Premedication was recommended for knee replacements; however, it did not improve pain or quality of life. Another study investigated the effect of gabapanentin on plantar fasciitsis. It showed improved pain and function in patients who received it. There were also improvements in blood pressure and activity among patients receiving gabanenthin."
18493163,"A paper titled ""In which evidence is used to predict the efficacy and safety of implant-based prostheses"" describes the use of two different types of implants, the Astratech Implants Dental system and the Brinnemark Implant System. The difference in bone level between the two systems is not significant; however, there are no significant changes in the marginal bone levels. This paper discusses the importance of using observational rather than experimental methods for finding out whether or not an intervention will work. In this paper, we examine the effect of photodynamic treatment on periimplantitious bone loss in dogs. After three years, all animals are sacrificed. Hetology continues to show that healing occurs during the initial phase of healing. Bionichesis remains unaffected by the placement of either type of device."
22947230,"In this paper, the results of a large number of recent studies on the long-lasting effects of treatment for children with hyperactivity disorder are presented. The most important risk factor for antisocial behavior is the presence of an overly severe form of attention-disordered hyperactive disorder. Children who have been initially treated with medication do not fare well in their academic performance. However, they show significant improvement in other aspects of their lives after treatment. For example, when combined treatment and drug management groups are used together, there is greater improvement than that of either group in terms of symptoms. A comparison between delinquincy and early substance abuse is made. This study concludes that it is necessary to continuously track the progress of patients with ADHD as they enter adulthood."
30022830,"In this study, we compared the effects of two different forms of treatment on children with autism: atomoXetine and parent training. The first group was superior to placebo for improving symptoms in children who had severe behavior problems. After eight weeks, both groups showed significant improvement. Both groups also showed improved scores on the Children's Real-Life Rating Scale. Rispurdone was more effective than placebo in improving social and communication functions in autmatic disorder. This is an important finding because it does not involve any additional side effects. A doubleblind, placebo-control study was conducted in which patients received either drug or placebo at a once-daily dosage. It found that there was no significant difference in the severity of the symptoms between the three groups. However, when the subjects were divided into two groups, they each received one dose of medicine. At the end of their treatment, however, only half of them experienced improvements. Furthermore, these results suggest that if further studies are needed, then halopridol may be even more promising."
26692005,"The primary safety endpoint was all-caus mortality, non fatal myo Cardiol infatriate ion, congesive heart failure, arrhythmies and hyper-and hypotensives events. In this study, we compare the efficaciousness of ferric caroxymaltosese to iron sucrose for patients with iron deficientiency or Nd-CKD. This is an important first step in treating irondeficiencies in patients who have low levels of blood ferritin. FCM improves fatigue, mental quality-of- life, and cognitive function in iron-deprived women with normal nor borderline blood concentration. Here, We want to test whether iron replacement can improve platelet count as well as activity in IB-related thromboticsis. All patients received either treatment or placebo on Day 7; no significant differences were found between the two groups. There were only Grade 3 or 2 adverse events after treatment. Parentseral ironcarbaciltose improved anemia in postpartum Anemia: A new Intrvenous Ferric Caroxymoltosole regimen was safe and effective treated with superiority to Oral Ferrous Sulfate/FeCrm in reducing Iron defiction anlysis in men with pre-existing iron dissipation."
26717446,"Orlistat reduces body weight and improves blood glucose levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes. In this study, we examine the effects of either orlistate plus diet on changes in body fat, gycemic, and lipid profiles in overweight patients. The results are mixed: there is a significant decrease in leptenin levels after treatment; however, both groups have improved their anthropometric values. This study also investigates the effect of one year of oristat on different circulating leprotin concentrations in type 2diabotic subjects."
29776983,"In this study, we systematically assess the risk of late infection in patients with total hiparthroplasty and compared the results of conventional and robotic-administered total knee replacements. We conclude that there is no significant difference in the severity of the complications between the two treatment groups. Aim Robotic assisted complete hip surgery remains controversial because wider exposure ofthe proxial femu and placement of an external rotation using rigid legholder equipment may impair greatly the hip abducttors. The benefits of these techniques might affect bone remodeling. Only female osteoarthritas patients who have no other drugs that might influence bone metabolism are enrolled. In addition, the effects ofrobotic milling on cementless full hip arthrosis are reported. This improvement has been shown to improve the accuracy of preoperative planning for both manual and robot approaches."
24123139,"The purpose of this study is to assess the reliability of the motor function measure, or MFM, in a prospective group of patients with Du Chenne muscular Dystopathy. This instrument has been used for assessment of severity and progression as well as for prediction of future events. A novel treatment for Duchenne's muscular disease is described."
30338697,"The results of a prospective, observational study of patients with carpal tunnel disease are presented. In this paper, the authors describe the use of patient-reported measures to predict the outcome of ankle surgery. They conclude that these measures are more sensitive to changes in severity and function than traditional measures of strength or sensibility. A significant increase in the response to self-assessment is noted for patients who report improved health status after their initial procedure. This indicates that physicians should be concerned about floor or ceiling effect when evaluating outcomes of treatment. Responsesiveness is calculated by correlating change in scores with external measures as well as an assessment of the most responsive body part on the SF 12 health survey. The relative responsiveness of different measure groups was determined by Correlating the changes between external measurements with the greatest responder subscale of ""the Bodily pain sub scale"". Furthermore, it was found that patients were more likely to achieve improvement after surgery than before. Four approaches were employed to interpret the collected patient reports: 1) preoperative functional status score; 2) lower extremity functional scale; 3) Rasch model; and 4) single-impedient knee pain relief scale."
28542867,"This study focuses on the effects of an eight-week exercise program on motor skills in children with severe spastic palsy. The control group performs 45 minutes of therapy twice a weeks for eight weeks, while the experimental group improves on all tests. In this study, we investigate the effect of balance training on children who have poor motor performance. Twenty-two children were assigned to an experiment and two were more successful than the other. We conclude that the use of Wii Fit training is safe and can be used as an adjuvant treatment to other proven success rehabilitating children after an acquired Brain injury. A pragmatic, quasiexperimental design was employed. Neuromotor task training and Nintendo WiI Fit Training were both used to improve performances in patients with motor coordination issues. Both groups showed significant improvements over the study time. These results suggest that they are suitable for treating children suffering from cerebral maltreatment."
22820555,"In this paper, we describe the effect of one single dose of a selective serotonine re-uptake inhibitor on amygdasis. We conclude that it is possible to delay the effects of these drugs for several weeks in order to determine whether they can be used as an effective treatment in patients with severe psychological disturbances. The efficacy of modaffinil has been reported in some studies; however, there are few reports of its use in treating mental illness. Modafiel improves short-term working memory and executive functions in healthy volunteers. A double-blindind, parallel group study employs 60 healthy students who were assigned to receive placebo or 100 or 200 milligrams ofmodafinill. Although no significant changes were seen in verbal recall or short term visual recognition memory, both groups did not show any change in mood or fatigue before the test session. This suggests that modanfinit may have potential at improving cognitive function in people suffering from schizophrenia. Antidepressant medication such as cloza pinetin improved behavior in depression but was not associated with improvement in learning or performance. Furthermore, antidepressedants had similar effects upon emotion-related task performance in normal healthy subjects. However, their effects were not clearly dose related. These results indicate that modulaprimil increases certain aspects of cognition and subjectively improvements participants' ability to attending post-night shift didactic sessions but makes it more difficultfor them to fall asleep during opportunities for sleep awaken. Meditates performed by 31 centers in United States between March 2002 and March 2006. Objective and subjective measures of sleepiness were also disturbed, but to less extent than those of other stimulant medications. Morbid symptoms were core features of disorder that are functional debilitated, associated poor outcomes, and resistantto existing pharmacologies. Brain Functioning and quality of Life were measured using the Functional Outside-of-Sleep Questionnaire, Short-form Health Survey /Foolish Outcomers of Sleep Questioner &Questionnaire Scores respectively. Narcolepsy sufferers often have excessive sleeplessness and fatigue. They received either 200 or 400mg daily for weeks 1 through 6 after which only seven patients abandoned the study due to adverse side effects. It is believed that all three types of stimulants work to restore brain activity and reduce fatigue in methmphetamine dependent individuals. There are no differences in"
24723255,"The aim of this study is to determine whether Lactobacilus acidphilus or Bifidinobacterium can reduce the incidence of necrottizing enterocotis in preterm babies. Induction of probiotic into infants with low birth weight was associated with reduced risk of nosococial infection, but no significant differences were found between the three group. A double-blindend trial was undertaken to assess whether Bfidophagus Lactis reducethe incidence and severityof necrotizing EnteroColitis in newborns at very lowbirth weight. No difference was detected in terms Of NEC riskreducing; RR / 0.54.95 % compared with placebo. Late-onset Sepsis remain an important riskfactor for death among verylow-bawn infantses and for prolonged Hospital stay among vaginal survivors. Epidemiological and growth outcomes are assessed at follow-up visits at 18 to 24 months of corrected age. Context Neonates received to the centers of the national institute of child health and human development over a two-year period. Two years later, strategies to reduce late start sepsions and its medical, social, and economic Toll need to been addressed urgently. Preterm Infants were studied at various stages of gestation from birth to discharge. There was little difference in the proportionate number of resistant bacteria per gram negative enteric isolateds. Probiotic feedings improved growth velocity in extremely lower birthweight neonates. However, there was not improvement in rate of growth delay at 35 weeks PMA. This study was furthermore designed to evaluate the efficiacy of LacTobacillus Acidophilus in preventing theoccurrence of UTIs, bacterial sereptis, as well as ""necroaching enteromecolitis"" in premature infanthood. It was concluded that these effects could be prevented by using prophylactic antibiotics during the first days of life."
17394228,"The National Hospital Physicians' disease-specific scores were not a significant predictor of age or disease severity in rhomboid arthritis. They also did not relate to the age and disease duration of the disease. Two hundred patients with relapsed musculosity were recruited. This study included fatigue, an assessment of chronic illness therapy, and measures of physical activity. Fatigue was found to be good internal consistency, as well as strong association with other measures such as vitality and pain. A pilot study was designed to teach patients who had RA that they could use rest periods to improve their health. After six weeks of exercise, there were no significant changes in joint count nor sedimentation rate. In addition, those who received more frequent exercises reported less fatigue. These results suggest that people with severe arthrosis may be better able to manage their symptoms without worsened their condition."
28743192,"This study focuses on the effects of an eight-week intervention on obesity and its associated risk factors. In this study, we examine the relationship between fat mass and aponectin in obese African American and Latino youths. We conclude that there are significant inverse relationships between these two groups. Twenty-one overweight and lean young adults were studied cross sectionally. After two months an adaption of the eating habit to food restriction is observed Methods and Procedures One hundredand and twenty children aged 10 -18 years were assigned to either lowcarbogeneous diet or lowfat diet for 2 month. The results showed that fasting insulin was reduced but leptmin was not. A high-prolonged breakfast promotes loss of weight in corpulent young men. Although there was no significant change in appetite sensation after mealtime, it was found that physical training did not improve blood levels of glumness. Furthermore, both treatment groups had different changes in their body mass index as measured by waist circumference. They also revealed differences in other measures of health such as body fatness, lipid profile, and concentrations of certain inflammatory chemicals. These findings suggest that exercise may be effective in reducing the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes."
27837440,"In this study, we examine the effect of combined nurse-care and health worker intervention on patients with Type 1 diabetes. The results suggest that the combined intervention has a greater reduction in Hba1c than the usual care treatment group. We conclude that it is possible to improve blood sugar control in African Americans without increasing their physician visits. A pilot study was conducted in an underserved neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania between 2000 and 2005. This trial examined the effects of two different types of patient management: 1) community health workers; and 2) nurses-led case management. After three years, the improvement in both groups was not statistically significant. However, there were improvements in body weight and insulin resistance among the intervention group as well as in satisfaction with care at one year's follow-up. Funging Diabetes England and the United States Department of Heath Purpose To evaluate the effixicacy of ""collaborative casemanagement"" for people with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes who have been newly diagnosed. At three months, confidence in diabetes education was significantly higher within the intervening group than in controls. For example, when asked about self-efficiecacy, participants in the empowerment group showed much better changes in physical activity and weight loss than they did in control subjects. They also reported less symptoms of Poor Glycemic Control than control patients. These results confirm previous reports of improved quality of care in Australian primary care."
27623982,"Is the use of prebiotics to treat obesity a safe and effective strategy for weight management. In this study, we examine the effect of freezed dried powdered inuline on blood microbial community composition in overweight women. The addition of short-chain fructoligosacides to an excessively high fat diet reduces total cholesterol concentrations but does not lead to any significant changes in lipid profile. We conclude that these results are due to the consumption of fermentable fiberinulin, which escapes digestion in the tiny intestine as it is fermenteled by the colony of microflorains into short chains of fatty acids. These effects are related to reduced fasting blood glucose levels. A doubleblind, placebo controlled crossover study was conducted in which fifty young healthy subjects received either FOS or surose for four wk. After two weeks, they were divided into two groups: one group with Flies and the other with controls. Both groups showed marked improvement in their appetite and side effects. They also showed improved glycemia and lipophosphorylation when compared to control groups."
11687163,"A study evaluating the effects of physical exercise on pain severity, stiffness and function among patients with irritable spondies was performed. The results showed that back exercises were more effective than supervised exercises in relieving pain and improving quality of life for patients suffering from ankyllosing sternoid disease. In this study, we examined the effect of recreational exercise or back-exertion on patient- reported pain intensity, tenderness severity and functional disability as a prospective longitudinal study of two20 patients who had rheUMAtoiD Arthropathies. After three or four weeks of intense treatment, all patients improved in their health but no improvement was seen in symptoms. This study furthermore investigated the efficacy of home-based exercise to treat patients affected by rickety neck injuries."
32307935,"The Women's health initiative Calcium and VitaminD trial is a prospective, i.e. random, observational study of post-mopalausal women over the age of 51 to 80 who have been taking either daily or placebo for menopause. This study focuses on whether there is an association between levels of 25-hydroxyvitamine D in relation to menophasal symptoms. In this study, we find no significant relationship between 25HVD levels and overall number of Menopausally symptoms at follow up. We conclude that 1000 mg of CaD plus 400 IV of vitamin D do not influence menoupause-regarding symptoms over an interval of 5.7 months. Furthermore, dryness and palatability are reduced significantly in treatment group compared to control at 56 day follow-up. A double-blinded clinical trial was conducted in which women were enrolled as soon as they had their first menouncement. They were divided into three groups: 1) patients with vaginal disease; 2) patients without vaginal drynness; and 3) those with bone turnover. There was an increased population of superficial cell populations during the study period. Estrogant deficiencies were the major cause of the pathophysiology of Postmenopusal Osteporoseis, the most commonly metabolic bone disease. These studies aim to evaluate the effects of different forms of estrogen replacement therapy on vaguinal health, prolapse, bladder andbowel function, and infection. After four years, changes in vaganl drynes were observed. At 12 weeks, mean vagal dryenness was reduced by 38.7 vs. raloxifedene groups. As expected, these results suggest that high amounts of both cad and vitamin C may be associated with lower risk of premature menopsis."
32152747,"The mini-meditus approach of total knee replacement is a promising new approach for patients with knee pain who prefer the parapatellare approach. In this study, we compare the results of two different approaches: the minimally incisioned medial parapellar approach and the miniature-medial subvastous approach to complete knee surgery. We conclude that the approach can lead to improved long- term knee function without increasing risk of componentmalalignment, surgical time, or  Complication rate. This study also examines the biochemistry of muscle damage during total Kneearthroplasty by measuring the levels of creatine kinsase, myogloin, glutamy oxalsoacetic Transaminases, interleuin-6, and interlesukin-1A on post-operative days 1 through 3; further studies are needed to determine the relationship between these two groups. After six months, no significant differences were found regarding range of motion at all. A prospective double blind trial was conducted to assess the early clinical andradigraphic outcomes of both approaches. It was concluded that there was no advantage to either approach in improving functional outcome after TKA but that it did not confer any substantial advantage in longer-term function."
25031196,"In this study, we examine the relationship between knee load and the annual changes in medial knee cartilage volume. We find that patients with knee pain who complete a weight-reduction program show significant improvements in their symptoms after one year of wear. This is due to the fact that they are more likely to have hip and knee osteoarthria than other patients."
29317216,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the effects of auditory-sensual information on reading performance in children with and without language learning. The results suggest that there is a strong relationship between autistic and childhood-onset mental disorder. This paper also discusses the role of the social reciprocity scale in determining the distribution and general structure of traits in the population."
30154381,"In this study, we use a genetic variant to predict whether or not vitamin D might have an anti-inflammation effect by examining the association between blood levels of 25-hydroxyvindal and C-Reactive Protein. We find that men with higher levels are at greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes than women with lower levels. A further study is performed on schoolgirls who have hypovitemia. The results suggest that there may be some relationship between high-choleric concentrations of serum 25HhD and insulin resistance in males."
31582860,"The effects of conjugated lipoic acid on the immune system are not studied in humans. In this paper, we report that a daily consumption of three g of CLA does not alter the production of chemokine by Pbmc or whole blood. This study is designed to compare the effect of two different forms of fat-soluble fatty acid, rTFa and iTTA, on total cholesterol and other cardiovascular risk factors for healthy subjects. Both groups have significant reductions in body weight after 12 weeks of treatment. A double blind, parallel- group trial was conducted to determine whether either group could improve body mass and reduce body fat. After 24 weeks, the control group showed no change in waist circumference or body composition. However, there were no significant changes in serum concentrations as measured by anthropometry. These results suggest that Cla can be used to improve strength gains and increase body size in overweight adults."
21146772,"In this paper, we describe the results of a two-year pilot study of an exercise intervention for overweight and obesity-prone Latino children. The first year is very successful; teachers receive high levels of satisfaction at training sessions and enjoyment in classrooms. A second year of the program improves physical activity by improving body mass index, waist circumference, and blood pressure. This worksite intervention has also been shown to have significant effects on weight reduction. For example, one group of workers reports that they are able to stretch during only 25 percent of conventional breaks while another group reports no effect. However, there is evidence that stretching does not increase pain or fatigue. Another study compares the effects of short intervals of physical movement on concentration in school-aged boys. Both groups show improved changes in height, weight, bone mineral content and bone area. These studies were conducted in three different cities: Somerville, California; Los Angeles County D.C.' worksites; and Two Soci-demographicly-matched cities was control communities. Children who participated in the intervention showed better performance on the Woodcock-J Johnson test of Concentration than those who did not participate. They also found greater gains in muscle strength and total body. Their main aim was to compare change in proximal femor bone geometry and spine between prepubertal men and controls. We examined differences in size, age, maturity, BMC, etc. among these groups. There were substantial gains as well as improvements in goal setting, satisfaction, selfefficacy, commitment and intentions. After six weeks, participants in both groups exceeded 9000 steps per day and 300 weekly minute of moderate intensity physical activities. One week later, smoking absolution symptoms were reported. To further reduce these symptoms, students were assigned to either daily or weekly walking strategies. At the end of each week, their sitting times were measured. When asked to sit again after 11 minutes of overnight smoke absorption, they responded with ""21 minutes/day"" and ""thirty minutes sustained walking every workday."" Thus, it is clear that walking can lead to reduced desire to quit smoking."
25271203,"The study consists of three factors mixed-design with 1 between subjects and 2 within subjects factors. In the first group, subjects were in a quiet posture while breathing increased dead space to induce hyperback pain; in the second group they were voluntarily increasing their respiration. This study examines the effects of both tasking and one-footed motion on postural control in patients with low Back Pain. Both subjects had poorer Posturo-Kindle control than healthy subjects. A motor was used to move the seat from one side to the other. There was no difference in body balance between the groups except for the mean change in center of pressure. These results suggest that chronic low back discomfort may be associated with altered body position."
20482475,"This study focuses on the effects of combined endurance and muscular strength training on patients with chronic chest failure. It is shown that resistance training induces similar changes in central hemodynamics to aerobic exercise when heart failure is present, but it is not yet known how these changes occur. In this study, we aim to determine the roles of skeletal Muscle mitochondrial Apotex production rate in relation to health-related psychological factors in patients who suffer from chronic heart failing. We examine the effect of eight weeks of resistancetraining on left ventricular structure and function among patients suffering from congestive Heart Failure. Six years after participating in a home-based rehabilitation program, patients had slightly better outcome than control subjects; maintained exercise capacity, engaged in activities exceeding the minimal amount prescribed by guidelines for Cardiological health Setting."
19508728,"A two-year early intervention pilot program for back injured nurses is compared to that of a similar treatment regimen. The patients receive prompt assessment and treatment, while the control group receives ""treatment as usual."" In this study, we describe an evidence-based approach to treating back pain in women with mutilated neck and back injuries. We report that the patient's return to work significantly faster than expected after six months of participation in the participatory exercise program. This paper reports on the use of active rehabilitation to improve workers' health by reducing their time off work due to lowback pain. It also reports that there are no significant differences between the severity of the injury and the length of sick leave."
28627214,"In this study, Wu et al. demonstrates that green tea extract has anti-obesity and weight-reduction potential. The subjects are assigned to three different treatments: 1) 50mg of green juice; 2) 100ml of epigallocateschin gallate; and 3) a placebo. After three months, the subjects' urinary excritation is higher in the green capsule than with the control group. A positive relationship between body mass and mineral concentrations was observed. This study examines the effects of red tea on fat loss in overweight patients. At the eightth and 12 weeks of the trial, body weight losses were significantly different. Both groups had significant changes in body composition. Green tea did not reduce body size in obese Chinese women who had pre-diabetes. They also showed no change in their blood pressure or other bodily functions. However, they did show an increase in total fat mass during the treatment period."
21690453,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates that the use of laparooscopic gastric boling and surgery can be used to treat patients with severe obesity. He shows that weight loss is associated with improved blood pressure, hypertension, and other risk factors. The study also suggests that bariatic surgery may be more cost effective than conventional medical treatment for patients who are Type 2 or Type 3 because it reduces the need for long-term medication. Anderson concludes by stating that ""gastric bypass"" is safe and effective in treating both types of patients. However, there are still some concerns about the safety of such an operation since many patients are seriously ill."
23913339,"The mean followup time for total hip aoroplasty is 6.2 years. In this study, the authors report that there are no complications associated with early hip migration. A total of 29 cups show remigration of less than one mm within two years; 13 of them have to be exchanged. This study reports on the results of 590 hips treated with cementless ACEtabular components between March 1996- December 1998. There was no asepticloosening of the Cup and no defects around the cup. After 18 years, two patients with 3 or more hip sockets died. Nineteen hip joints had osteoarthrits secondary to developmental dissipation. To evaluate how different methods of cup fixing affect cup survival, we performed on 87 knees in 82 patients. Fixation did not differ from the other groups because of their different types of fixation: press fit technique only, pegfixation, or hypoapatites. Cup survival rate was assessed clinically, Histologically/radiographically, and laboratory-assigned Ebra method."
23337783,"In this paper, we describe a method for reporting the results of studies that use ""r and Omized design"" or ""non-rand and OMized designs"" to determine whether or not treatment of fractures is cost effective. We conclude that using case managers for patients with low-energy hip fracture can increase the rate of appropriate treatment by up to 30 percent. This suggests that systems such as ours will be able to reduce fracture rates, gains in lifetime expectancy, and substantial Cost savings. A retrospective study was performed to establish the frequency of treatment for low energy fractured patients. The percentage of complying with the protocol increased from 887 to 57.2 per patient. Although Osteoprasis is strong associated with hip breaks, the onset of osteoporrosis treatment follows hip falls at remarkably low rates ofbetween 5 %) and 30 0%. These conclusions suggest that system implementing an intervening intervention similar to those we have seen should expect to find reassurance, gain in life expectancies, but substantial cost savings"
30787096,"A prospective cohort study is designed to assess patient response to an exercise intervention in patients with shoulder pain. The results of the study are compared to those obtained from other controlled trials. In particular, the Danish Shoulder Score and the English Constant Score are used as predictors of patient responsiveness. After a follow up assessment of 112, the minimal clinically important difference between these two scores is determined. This study will determine whether the effect of this exercise regimen can be extended to patients suffering from shoulder cuff injuries."
30799194,"The Shanghai Women's Health study is a prospective, population-based cohort of 73,942 females aged 40 to 70 who were divided into six groups. In this study, the aim of the study was to investigate whether Cinnamon can improve blood glucose levels in people suffering from Type 2 diabetes. This study included 60 patients with Type 2, 30 men and 30, women aged 52.3 years. A total group of 60 people had type 2 disease. After two months, fasting bloodglucose declined significantly in the Cinnnamol group; however, there was no change in body fat mass or systelic blood pressure after intervention. Furthermore, cinnamon improved both blood sugar levels and lipid concentrations in subjects with type 3 diabetes but not in those with low-dental lipoprotein content. Thus, this paper suggests that using coconut as an anti-diabetic agent may be useful for improving blood vessel health in individuals with high-risk pregnant conditions."
21059667,"Preoperative physiotherapists were found to be less likely to develop postoperative complications than patients who did not receive preoperative care. A prospective cohort study was conducted to determine the effect of short- term preoppressive exercise on functional recovery and quality of life in patients with acute obstruthive pulmonary diseases. Short-term pulmonary rehabilitation was shown to improve function before and after surgical intervention, as well reduce the risk of severe complications. In this paper, we describe an eight-week program of physical therapy for patients scheduled for hip arthrosm surgery. After two years, both groups improved their performance in Harris hip score but no differences in pain or function were seen between the two groups. This paper concludes that ""integrated programmes of premobility and early rehabilitation"" are more cost effective than standard care alone."
22437353,"A prospective, i.e. single-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of two novel approaches to treating atrial fibrilation in patients more than 6 month's time. The results are similar: both groups undergo mitral valve repair or replacement with an intense rhythm control strategy. Both groups have similar age, gender, and other characteristics. In the control group, only one patient dies during the follow-up period. After six months, however, all patients return to normal sympathetic response. This is important because it indicates that there is no significant difference in the severity of the disease between the two groups. For example, after surgery, patients who had undergone epicardial la cryobation were better able to regain their sinus rhythm. However, this first trial showed that using Mvs. alone system is significantly better for eliminating permanent af than MVS combined with epicartal cryostablation. At 12 months follow up, 73.3 percent of patients received regaining their SinusRhythm. More than half of these patients returned to good health. Another study was designed to compare the success of new treatments over conventional methods by calculating the mean gain from each treatment. It found that innovation was relatively constant throughout the study design but that some trials did not use double blinded designs. Most importantly, they reported improved long-term performance when compared against those treated with traditional methods. These studies also included comparisons of innovations with ""st"" and ""ard"" therapy. They measured the gain on the basis of how much improvement was gained as well as the proportion of successful outcomes."
29309554,"The reviewers agree on the final set ofdomains that adequately, completely defined everything, that reasonably could be used to assess biases. Of 14062 patients with persistent atrial fillation, 11 546 had paroxysesmal AF. Aimantithropy prophylaxes for stroke are recommended for at risk patients without persistent or parosmal atrium fiilation. Over 370 days follow-up acute hazard was found in 40 th of patients who had 11 times more likely develop thrombolysis complications than those without detectable ahre. In addition, over an annualized mean rate of stroke was similar between those with sustained and non-fatal stroke. Although intermittent affliction is common, relatively little has been known about its attendant risk of death. Heart failure, hypertension, age older than 70 years, diabetes, or prior heart failure were also associated with increased risk factors. This prospective observational study will determine whether pacemaker devices can accurately predict blood pressure and severity. It will use machine-generated information to predict major bleeding and stroke events."
26180255,"In this study, the effects of a combination of calcium and Vitamin D on hip bone loss are examined. The results indicate that the active treatment is more effective than the placebo group in reducing hip fractures. A1C values predict the development or severity of Type 2 diabetes. Conclusions In individuals with Prediabetes/hypovitaminoses D, doses to raise serum-25-hydroxyvitaminid D levels into the Upper-Normal range for 1year have no effect on Insulin secretion, insulin  sensison, or the developing of diabetes comparing with placebo administration OgTTs were done 3, 6, 9 & 12 months later. This study was based on standardized methods used to assess changes in body composition among postmenopalusal women. After 15 weeks, there were significant age related decreases in fat mass, percentage body fat, height, waist circumference, and total body weight. There were considerable age-related increases in Ffm and height and increase in total bmi, percent BF, weight,and BMI. Estradiol Vlerate combined with vitamin C reduced the risk from having at least one fall over one year after adjusted for height. Both groups received ergocaliferol, which was associated with an 18 % reduction as compared to other treatments. However, both groups lost their weight during the course of the study."
21880286,"This study focuses on the association between blood pressure and cardiovascular events among postmenopatras. The results of this study indicate that weight loss after laparography is associated with improved blood flow, reduced body weight, and improved quality of life in patients who undergo gastric bypass. In addition, there is no significant difference in the severity of their pre-surgery complications. A prospective case-control study compares the effects of weight reduction on mortality from atheroscian heart disease and other risk factors. After an initial period of observation, all endpoints were found to be significantly different between the two groups. For example, one group had a lower risk of death than the other; however, the relative risk was not as high as it had been for the control group."
29718689,"In this study, the authors compare a Mediterranean-style diet to 'low-carbogeneous' diets for weight loss and risk factors in type 2 diabetes. The results are similar: patients lose more weight than those on the low carbohydrate group after 24 months of follow up. A comparison of the two diet groups is made between the lower fat group and the high-moleculiarity group. This study also examines the effect of moderate-fat diet changes on blood pressure, body weight, and body composition in older adults with Type 2 Diabetes who are not treated with Insulin."
31367297,"In this study, we examine the effects of simvalstatin on oxidation stress and taurine in patients with chronic kidney disease. Simvastain is more effective than either statin or placebo in reducing blood concentrations of cholesterine by inhibiting HMG-Glutaryl-CoenzymeA reductases, the ratelimiting enzyme in lipoprotein synthesis. We also investigate the role of taurin in hypercholerolemia. The results of this trial are described in this paper. A total of forty subjects were included; of which 39 complete the trial. This study was performed on 50 patients from different age groups and 20 healthy subjects. There was an increase in their serum basking in the glow of the sun. After treatment, there was significant increases in hisald activity and vasodelaxation. Urine samples were collected for assessment of proteinurian status. These studies were carried out on fifty patients without hepatic disease who were not treated with nexphropathy. They were divided into three groups: control group, which consisteted of 30 healthy people; group I, consisting of 20 type 1 diabetic Egyptian patient with or without Nephropathia; and group II, comprised of twenty type 2 dialysis patients that were assigned to either drug or cerivatin. All three treatments significantly reduced protrophmbin fragment 1, 2, and 3 levels from their respectively baselines. Endotothelium dependent vasolation improved by 46.7 %) after 3 daysof Statin therapy comparing with before therapy. Both drugs showed marked reductions in both lipid levels as well as in endotility function. Ascorbatin combined with Amlopidine reduces blood pressure to greater extent than Atorvastin alone. Insulin levels increased significantly after 12 weeks but did not alter insulin sensitivity. Biomarkers such as Apo B and Thrompmodulin were found missing. Thirty two patients were given atorvatatin 20mg per day or amlorodipine 10, 10 mg perday. No significant changes were obtained in these two groups."
24977635,"In this paper, the effects of thoracusal epidural Analgesis on post-operative complications are examined. The results indicate that there is little difference in blood loss and volume replacement between the three groups. Post-opportunities for patients with severe fractures are similar to those for other types of surgical procedures. Acute hip surgery is performed under spinal anesthesia or by general anessia. There is no significant differences in the severity of pain at rest and after physiotherapy. After hip replacement, patients receive either patient-controlled epidural analgy or generalane. This study compares the efficacy of both methods in terms of long-term outcome. It concludes that it is not possible to predict the exact effect of each method on the length of stay during the hospital stay."
25169459,"This study consists of two controlled trials. The first is a double-blinded trial in which 153 children are randomed to receive either chemometrist or placebo for the treatment of attention-defiant hyperactivity disorder. In both groups, there is significant improvement from baseline on the Doctor's Rating Scale for ADHD and no significant changes in other health-related measures. Both groups have similar adverse events; however, they do not show any significant differences in quality of life between the two groups. A reduction from base on an investigator-rated assessment of ADHD was found with Oros methylphenis date treatment comparing with placebo. Children who received this treatment were better tolerated by dosages as high as 72mg/d than those receiving placebo during the first four weeks. However, most patients experienced mild to moderate side effects during their first 4 weeks after starting treatment. After 2 years, combined treatment did not result in superior functioning but improved overall function. Another study examined the effect of atomomexetine once daily on symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyteractivity Disorder. It was performed between 2000 and 2003 and showed that it was much more effective than usual in treating adults with ADHD. All subjects were either responders whom were much improved nor nonresponders. They also had no demographic or medical predictors about response. For each point we review three important areas that we believed are important for appreciate of the findings: definition of efficacy from the MTT, interpretation of serial presentation of findings at every assessment point with different definitions of long- term effects, and qualificationof the interim conclusions regarding long terms effects of treatments"
22574624,"In this study, we examine the efficacy of a single daily dose of iron orfolic acid for the treatment of children with anemia. We conclude that it is more effective than either group in terms of improving their health. The results of this trial suggest that LeuCovorin may be useful in treating Down's Syndrome. Children who receive leucocounoin alone or mixed with folate have higher haemologlobin levels than those treated with placebo. A double blind, cross-over test was carried out on 196 children aged 6 to 12 years. No significant difference was observed between either groups in respect of change in weight, Haemogloin concentration, serum Folate, Red cell Folation ; or evidence of disease."
16034862,"The rate of post-operative infections in the two arm groups is compared. In patients who have acute appendicetis, the infection rate is significantly lower than that of those who receive no prophylic antibiotics. This suggests that adding an outpatient course of IV antiseptics does not decrease infectious complications after appendictectomy. A total of 374 children requiring emergency Appendicectomy were entered into this study. No differences occur in wound infection in either group. Wound Irritation with 1 percent cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium brodmide was also ineffective in preventing wound disease in all grade grades ofappendicitiis. When wound contaminants are difficult to avoid, as in preforated appendingix, topicalampicillin should beused to reduce the frequency of wounded infection. Prophylus for acute and gangreous applications has been shown to be superior to cefam or ole when it comes to treating wounds without perforations. Although there is no significant difference between these two treatment regimens, we conclude that they do not offer sufficient protection against wound outbreaks during surgery. We suggest that single dose antibiotic prosphylaxes only in those with high risk from speptic complications After apppendicatorectomy, which is reduced to 44 percent by a one-dose of clindinamycin, are recommended. There is some evidence that using metirondazole alone can improve the effectiveness of such treatments; however, many studies have suggested that combination of aerobes and metronidrazle may be more effective in preventing postopéranificant wound infections."
23867731,"The purpose of this review is to identify methods that assess the quality and validity of prognosesis studies and how well current practices assess potential bias. In this paper, we describe a study in which patients with low-back pain receive motor control exercises for eight weeks. There is no association between improvement in pain and change in disability. A further study investigates the relationship between muscle strength and changes in transversus abdominis during rapid arm movement. This study also focuses on the effect of motorcontrol exercise on pain relief. It was found that there was no significant difference in injury after treatment. However, it was noted that subjects with lower back pain did not respond to either type of exercise. Another study examining the relation between abdominal muscles and their response to fast arm movements was carried out. These results suggest that an exercise program may be useful for patients suffering from low back Pain."
25746842,"In this study, the effects of green tea on blood lipids and fasting glucose in patients with Type 2 diabetes are investigated. The results indicate that green-teared treatment is more effective than placebo in improving both glyceric control and blood sugar levels in type 2 patients. A large Indian population has been used to cultivate an extensive variety of anti-disease agents. Antioxidants have also been shown to be beneficial in treating Type 1 and 2 disease. For example, they have been reported to reduce blood glutination and improve insulin sensitivity. However, there is no clear evidence for any benefit from flavonoids in postmenopatusal women with T1D. This study furthermore investigates the effect of flavonoidas on other risk factors such as lipoprotein concentration and body mass. It was found that consumption of these polyphenols was associated with reduced risk of heart attack and stroke."
32225172,"Infants who receive Oral Colstrum Priming after birth have a reduction in the length of their hospitalization. The aim of this study is to determine the rate, characteristics, risk factors and outcomes of ventilation-associated pneumonia during preterm infanthood. In addition, it is shown that there is an association between ventilator-related pneumonia and mortality. A total of two29 patients were enrolled in this trial. Nineteen chapters of VAP were studied in 19 mechanically ventilatid patients. Thirteen episodes occurred in 19.3 % of 67 Mechanically Ventured Patients. Probiotics were significantly lower than control patients; 36.4 p..1 v. 50.4 percent, respectively; P= 0.031. This was followed by studies on the incidence of severe sepsies and the costs of neonatal care unit. These studies are further investigated in terms of the severity of convalescent pneumonia. There is no significant difference in late-onset or necrotizing Enterocolitis among either group."
29341831,"In this study, we report the results of a phase II trial in which 54 patients with myelostasis were treated with zoleldronic acid 4mg. At the end of the trial, all patients improved their bone mineral denition by an average of +15.0 %. The overall survival and skeletal related events were also reported for the entire trial population. Overall survival is similar between the treatment groups. A safety study was performed on thalidide and chlorophosparic acid in myelsina patients receiving these two drugs. No significant differences were found in either group during the 16-month period; however, no significant side effects were noted. This study supports immediate treatment with soledronic alpha in patients who have newly been diagnosed multiple myaloma. We concluded that vaginal tether consolidation post asct reduces bone regurgission but is associated with low incidence of skull-retrieval events after the first or second valiant block. Only one patient developed any skeleton-related event at the beginning of VTD therapy. Another study showed that denoumab reduced mortality by16 p.. However, it did not improve survival in terms of risk factors for Onj development."
12076233,"In this study, we assess the effect of single doses of silicdenafil on erectility in patients with ""spina bificida."" The results of this treatment are as follows: improvement in all four parameters after treatment; increased frequency of eryections and improved response to questions 1 and 15 of the international Index of Encemented Function. This study is funded by PFFizer. A comparison of diary results shows no difference between groups with respectto the mean number or erectors hard enoughfor penetration. We conclude that goal-oriented therapy is highly successful in men with impotence."
23190278,"The survival rate for different restorative materials is compared in this paper. For example, the success of composite resin-based restorations is better than that of conventional crowns. A fourth study adds results on which material will be the best option to replace amalgam in primary teeth. This paper reviews three published papers with additional results from another four study which aim to determine which Restortive material would bethe best alternative to amalgam ""AM"" inprimal teeth."" The first study was an intervention study whereby dentists were assigned between two groups of lesions and treated by one group of surgeons while the other group was free to choose the most appropriate material. In this study, patients were divided into six classes: Class I, Class II, class III, and class IV. After 6 months, they were evaluated by two experienced assessors using USPHSRyge Criteria. The results show that large ClassI cavities had significantly higher survival rates than do small ClassIII cavities. Purpose To evaluate the effects of a Chhexidinegluconate solution on the performance of glass-iomer cement after the art approach under field condition after 24 months. Results showed that the 24-month mean Cumulative survivalrate of Ketatc Molarwithout the use of Disinfectant was 97. 7 % and 70.4 %) while in the disinfected category, large Classes II cavities have significantly better survival speeds than did small Type II Cavities. PURRPOSE To compare the effect of two tooth-isosolation methods on recovery of root caries in children, we used two isolation methods; rubber dam orcott wool rolls, 3 br and silicacid cements are used by the operator's hands. It was concluded that there was no difference in pain during traumatic restourative treatment but that it was less painful when the technique was used. Both approaches resulted in improved long-term patient survival. Caries lessions in 103 institutions in Hong Kong can be treated according to either method: 1) the conventional approach --caries removed by drills and the cavityfilled with light-cursed resinmodified glass/ionomers; or 2) the Art Approach --Caries remove by hand instruments and fill with chemically curled high-treachery glass ionicOMer. There was not significant difference among the eight operators in terms of their ability to perform multiple-surface repairs."

This paper also compares the three-year survival rates of glass posts and compositecores with those of gold-alloyed posts in endodonticly treated teeth. It shows that there is no difference in success time between different types of posts."
30823873,"This study focuses on the validity of the Veterans' Physical Activity Questionnaire, which is used to assess physical activity in older adults. It uses an accelerometry approach to track changes in strength and energy expenditure over time. The results of this study suggest that exercise training for older patients with aortotic aneuriesm may be more effective than self-reporting measures."
27820218,"In this study, the effects of group-based care on patients with type two diabetes are compared. After six months, subjects in the group receive better health and behavior than those in their usual care. This is due to improvements in patient education, self-regard, and improved quality of life. The goal of the study is to determine if an educational program can be used to improve Type 2 diabetes management by using group visits as a preventive measure. A pilot study was conducted in Mexico to evaluate the efficacy for delivering group care to patients who had been previously treated without improvement in blood glucose control. It was found that groups were more effective in improving both physical and mental health."
22005864,"A double-blinded trial compares the use of cruciate bearing and posterior-strutted total knee replacements. The results show that there are no significant differences between the two methods of fixation. After 5 years, both types of implants have good survival. In contrast, cementless knee prostheses fail at an average survival rate of 80.7 percent. This study is followed by a prospective randoment in which patients receive either cemented or metal bearing. No difference in functional outcomes is seen between these two groups. There is no evidence of Ostelysis nor loosening during follow-up. Three different means of Fixation for Total Knee Artroplasty were studied: 1) fixed bearing with cement; 2) uncoated components; and 3) rotating platform. Both designs showed improved function and survival after knee surgery. These results suggest that self-alignment might improve patellor tracking and decrease the prevalenceof lateral retinacul release. Self-Aligned may improve Patellar Tracking and increase the frequency of motion under the ""tibial"" part of the knee. Two hundred knees were entered into this prospect ive ve i v'blinded/r and Omized surgical trial in where 50 patients received Genesis II PS Insert and 50 those received HF insert. At an annual follow up of 2.73 years there were no changes in any outcome measure. Longer term evaluation will be needed to comment on comparisons in polyethylene Wear and implant longevity"
30017172,"In this study, we compared the effects of two different forms of reveratrol on patients with Type 2 diabetes. The first group received 500mg rsverarol and the second group was given a placebo. This study is important because it will allow us to gain an understanding of the mechanism of action of these compounds in humans. We conclude that both groups are well-to-do for their respective disease states. For example, rats were treated with myocarial ischemic/reperfusal alone or mixed with renegrosel. Both groups showed significant reductions in liver enzymes, cytokine levels, and steatopsis. These results suggest that more studies need to be performed before further conclusions can be made about the efficacy of either treatment."
22354262,"The mean change in blood pressure from baseline in both groups was 0.69 ml. g 1 p a min1, 95% confidence interval ; vs. placebo group was 1.65 mmL / 100 G1 Min1 at time point over the next 24 hours and finally at two weeks."" This is significant because it shows that perindopurl does not lower BP in patients with severe hypertension. In addition, it increases the CBF Index significantly in comparison to those receiving placebo. A recent study compares the effects of angiotensol-converting enzyme on cerebral circulation after stroke. After nine days of treatment, 19 patients are randozed to an antihysteria regimen. They receive either 4 mg or 5mg per day for 3 days. Brain Snack: There have been several studies showing that high stolic as well as diastopic pressures are associated with reduced risks of headache. These studies suggest that low bps may be due to the baroretic system influencing brain stem and spinal cord function. However, these studies do not show any differences between age, gender, and efficacy of the drugs."
19370593,"The Women's health initiative trial of combined equaine estrogens with or without medical acetate was stopped early because there was not benefit for coronarry heart disease and increased risk ofstroke. In this paper, the authors describe the results of their study on breast cancer in women who began hormonal therapy soon aftermenopause. They conclude that treatment with CEE does not increase mammography at 1 year but only increases breastcancer incidence in post-mastectomy women. Estrogan therapy is associated with significant increase in ""nephrolitiais risk"" from 34 to 40 cases per 10000 person-year; however, rand and mized controlled trials have not yet been performed on this subject. This paper also discusses the effect of progestiners on fastering glucose levels among women suffering from type 2 diabetes. Although no evidence exists against using these regimens as preventive measures, it is believed that they may be effective in relieving symptoms of acute stroke."
30926250,"The reviewers agree on a set of ""domains"" that define all the extracted items. For example, in this case, we're looking for studies that have potential bias because they represent source population or populations of interest and are related to patients who might be at risk of being misdiagnosed. We also look for papers that relate to older patients with breast cancer. This study is designed to assess whether geriatic assessment can predict long-term survival after surgery for elderly patients without curative intent. It was found that there was no significant relationship between the G80 score and severity of treatment toxicity. However, it did show an association between disease-free survival and severe treatment efficacy when adjusted for age and type of patient. In this study, our aim is to determine whether or not these measures improve health-related quality of life or overall survival in older adults with cancer; whether nor not such measures improved functional status and mortality in the elderly is not yet clearly clear. A phase III multi-centre trial will be conducted to evaluate the efficiacy of glumating regimens in elderly people with malignant tumors. Our goal is first to identify the extent of improvement in both performance and outcome by using standardized scores from the General Geriatric Score as predictors: 1) advanced stage deterioration, 2) hematology sensitivity, 3) timed up and go, and 4) emotional functioning. After two years of followup, only 73 patients were eligible for intervention. Another study compares the effect of home care on older women with colon carcinoma. Women in their case management group had more breast reconstruct surgery than those who received usual care in an outpatient setting. Finally, another study examines how nurse casemanagement affects length of survival among older post-surveillance patients. They find that nursing care has been associated with better survival than conventional care. These studies suggest that CGA may be useful in predicting future complications in old patients due to its ability to predict fatigue and physical decline."
28831565,"In this study, the effect of endoscopic or tension-free inguinal shenia repairs on inflammatory response was investigated. The results showed that the wounds were less traumatic in the open approach than in laparoscopic approaches. Both methods seemed to be more traumatized and had shorter post-opportunities. A comparison between the two approaches was made. Laparcotic hernisa repair was performed under an extended general anecdote with no significant differences in length of operation, duration of hospital stay, time to recover to normal activities, or mean VAS score. This study compares the efficacy of the light-weight polypropylenin mesh with the Bassini technique for treating patients who have unilateral heronius. There is no difference in blood cell count after surgery except for C-Reactive Protein content. However, there is a significant increase in interleukine-6 concentrations in both groups."
31664495,"The Enhanced Recover After Surgery program has been shown to reduce the complications and length of stay in patients with colonic disease. In this study, Anderson compares the efficacy of an enhanced recovery program for patients who undergo open or laparoscopic surgery. Although there is no mortality, it is reported that the improved outcome is independent of the use of fast track clinical pathways. This study determines whether using fast-track approaches to improve patient outcome after elective color censure can be cost-effective."
20078374,"The Nurses' Health Study consists of two cohorts, one with low-risk children and the other with high risk children. In this study, we examine the association between consumption of sweeteners and risk of hypertension in children aged 3 to 6 years. A greater increase in soda is associated with increased waist circumference, while a greater decrease in milk intake is also related to an increased reduction in waistcircference. This study investigates whether artificial sweetners can improve weight loss by altering blood glutinony levels. We give free-living subjects 1150g of aspartume or high fructose corn Syrup per day for three wk. Both groups lose approximately 10 %) of their initial body weight during active weight Loss was also positively reflected by exercise and self-rated eating control. Aspartame increases the amount of sugar consumed without affecting other nutrients. Type 2 diabetes has been increasing in African American females since the early 1900s. Although there are many studies on the effect of drinking sweetened drinks on weight gain, no single study has examined the relationship between diet change and BMI. Consumption does not seem to have any significant effect on either group. However, several studies have suggested that reduced food choices may lead to improved health."
29290882,"In a double-masking study, patients in both groups showed significant improvement in their meibomyn glial and dysfunction symptoms after 3 months. Both groups also showed improvements in the quality of tear film, which was not different from that of the control group. The authors conclude that this treatment is safe and effective for treating dry eyes. Aim To investigate the use of heated electrodes to treat dry eye. This device has been used successfully in several studies; however, there are still some concerns about its safety."
23001018,"Warfarin has a lower risk of stroke than aspirin for patients with moderate-risk atrial fibrilation. In this study, we examine the cost effectiveness and safety of dabigan in patients who are at high risk or have sustained thrombosis. We conclude that it is cost effective to treat these patients using aspidin instead of warfari. A large cohort of patients treated with intermittent atrium fibrillation receives similar rates of severe stroke and death than those with long-term chronic attrition. Costs over four years are lower in the group of regimens used by the Canadian National Health Service. The effect of age was not significant; however, there were some differences in relative costs between the two groups. For example, older patients had less coronarry artery disease. However, women were more likely to develop heart failure than men because of their higher risk from blood loss. This study uses an earlier risk stratification method to predict stroke risk in people with acute atar fibrillation but does not reveal any specific risk factors."
26435098,"This randomized, cross-sectional study consists of 52 patients who have been instructed to participate in an exercise program that improves their leg circulation. The subjects are divided into two groups: the first group is comprised of patients with a milder form of peripheral arterial disease and the second group consisting of those with moderate or severe forms of paternal artery disease. In this paper, the results of the polestride training program are compared with those of other treatment regimens for improving walking performance in people with chronic claudicular pain. These results suggest that home-based exercises are more effective than supervised exercise because they involve greater frequency of daily activity. A controlled clinical trial compares changes in primary outcomes measures of physical health and level of independence as well as upon the facets of pain and discomfort, energy and fatigue, mobility, activities of everyday living, dependence on medication and treats, working capacity, negative feelings, recreation and leisure and overall quality of life. Results indicate that each group improved significantly in both walking time and cadence after 12 weeks of intervention. After one year, these results were largely preserved. Another prospective open-label study examines the effect of structured exercise training on improvement in functional capacity over 24 weeks. It was found that ""ti-To,"" which involved 2 daily 10 minute home walking sessions per day at maximal symptomatic speed, reduced walking disability in periphery arterial diseases."
24635850,"In this paper, we show that the slope of the MAS and the intercept of stiffness plotted on the joint angle do not relate to spasticity. We also use an electrode-electrified system to track the changes in the muscles during a series of passive motions. The results suggest that there is little relationship between the muscle's slope and its response to movement. A new device has been developed for measuring the velocity-responsiveness of spastician elbow muscles. This device will be used in children with spinal cord injury as well as in patients with acute stroke."
22984894,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective, observational study comparing the accuracy of an implanted total kneearthroplasty to that obtained by conventional surgical methods. The patients in the control group were divided into three groups: conventional surgery with extramedullary guides, guided-artificial knee replacement using navigation, and conventional knee arthrostry with manual guidance. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of both approaches for improving patient outcome. Although there is no difference in preoperative scores or complications between the different groups, the improvement in alignment is significant. A further study compares the use of two different types of navigation devices on knee arthroplaies; one group uses single trackerpins while the other uses imageless navigation pins. Both groups show similar knee function scores at six weeks, three months, six months after surgery, but neither group has undergone revision."

In addition, he suggests that certain risk factors may be different when it comes to specific cerebro-vascular risk. He also discusses other studies that have examined the benefits of statin for patients with high risk but suggest that it does not improve their overall health."
27258214,"In this study, we assess the efficacy of three-lead lead ECG as a stand-alone test for atrial fillation in patients aged over age 65. We also examine the value of echocardiography and other risk factors in predicting stroke severity. The results of these studies suggest that there is little difference in the severity of stroke among patients with or without atrium fibrillation. A cluster-rand-omised control trial was designed to determine the prevalence and the frequency of new cases by using multiple approaches. It was found that the detection rate of New cases of atary fiilation was 1.16 p.m. compared with 1.04 pp. in control practice's. Furthermore, it was determined that an additional risk factor for stroke was left unrecognized. This study involved evaluating the effectiveness of different methods of screening including whole population, systematic, or obportunistic strategies. Atrial Fibrillations were detected in more than two- thirds of those who had left ventricular stiffness not on Angiotensine converting enzyme inhibits. Heart failure and Stroke are Major causes of Morbidity and Mortality in older people. Anticoagulants are effective in strangulation with aspiron being unable to be effective.

11074683,"The aim of the study is to identify progostic factors in patients with lower back pain who are absent from work for at least four weeks. In this study, a new patient question-naire was developed and used to assess changes over time in subjects with chronic lowback pain. A significant difference in the scores between the control group and the treatment group was found after three months. This study further investigates the use of an instrument called the ""RM Question-A"" to predict changes in severity and function in people with low back problems."
28599375,"In this study, we examine the effect of a probiotic diet on blood glucose control in type 2 patients with Type 2 diabetes. We found that the consumption of conventional bread had no significant effect on total cholesterol or trigllyceride levels; however, there was little difference in the weight gain of the pro-biotic group. This study is an attempt to determine the effects of both pro and conventional dairy on fasting blood sugar concentrations in pregnant women with gestational disease. The results suggest that these two groups may be useful for controlling the severity of pregnancy complications."
20011929,"In this study, we examine the effects of a heated skin surface on wound healing in patients awaiting elective abdominal surgical procedures. We conclude that hypothermial therapy may delay healing for some time and thus increase the risk of infection. A comparison is made between two groups of patients: one group receives warm air during surgery and the other group gets only cold air after surgery. The results are similar to those obtained from other studies. Post-operative blood loss is significantly greater in both groups; however, the extent of hypothria's influence on bleeding remains unknown."
30921478,"A meta-analysis of 370 randomized drug trials is presented in this paper. The primary outcome for each analysis is the primary result, and all trials included are examined by physician and patientglobal assessment. Alprasolam or imipromine were significantly superior than placebo in treating panic disorder. In addition, they showed greater improvement on measures of anxiety, depression, somatics, fears, avoidance, disability, quality of life, as measured by Hamilton Anxiness Rating Score and Patient Global Evaluation Score. This study confirms the effectiveness and safeness of alprazzoam, especially at higher doses in patients with Panic disorder who also met DSM III-R criteria. All patients received treatment from 10 sites following identical protocol. Only fifty percent of these patients completed eight weeks of treatment apparently because of activatement early in treatment"

The relative risks were 95 p.c. intervals comparing the lowest with the highest quartiled of total dairy product, milk, and Yogurt were 1.63; 1.07 / 2.19 ; and 1.52. Moreover, calcium or saturated fat had been suspected as causative agents. Fermented breast milk may protect from breast cancer by stimulateing immune activity. Afraid to consume more dairy than other foods, women are refrained from it for three months. Lactoferin-enriched yogurt has an anti-proliferative effect on blood pressure. Consumption is also associated with increased risk of stroke in middle aged American women. Although no differences in post snack perceived hunger or completeness were observed among the NP's and Hippolyte snacks, they showed significant increases in appetite control, sateiety, delayed eating, etc. These studies suggest that low dairy content may increase the risk for acute or chronic illness. However, there is no evidence that this association can be explained by diet."
17285783,"In this study, we report on the effects of steroid replacement therapy in 27 healthy men with low to borderline low levels of serum T levels. The results suggest that testosterone replacement may be beneficial for older men who are deficient in growth factor and insulin like growthfactor I as well as for elderly people who have low blood test concentrations. Although there is some evidence that these treatments can lead to changes in body composition, muscle strength, and cardiac endurance, it is not yet clear whether they will have any significant effects on these patients. After 12 months of treatment, both androgens increase muscle mass; mean change from base - 3.5 %), + 5. 8 %, or 0.9 0% in testosterone, nand rolone, placebo groups, respectively,P  1.0001. Men receive resistance training at least twice weekly. This does not result in improvement in physical performance or strength over 24 months. However, after 36 months, ""physiological and near-physical increases of testosterone"" in old men improve their muscle function. They also show improved lean body Mass, haemologlobin, packed cell volume, reduced lipoprotein content, increased bone mineral density, etc."
25392297,"The European Diabetes Self-Management Education project aims to improve the quality of care for patients with or without Type 2 Diabetes by comparing national strategies in the U.S., Taiwan, and Israel. In this paper, we describe the process of developing an effective diabetes education and follow up education program for Mexican Americans. We examine the effect on a patient-based clinic approach on blood sugar control and self-efficiecacy of Chinese patients who have type 2 diabetes. This study is aimed at evaluating the efficacy as well as the benefits of using the HBM health belief model to develop an educational program that will reduce the complications of Type 2, diabetics. It also focuses on improving the performance of nurses in providing support to patients during their initial stages of illness."
29420704,"The safety and performance results of the transcathet aortics valve replacement system are described. In patients who have severe stenoses, the use is superior to using able and permanent pacemakers. This study determines the rate of new per-pacemaker implantation after Transcatheliter Valve replacement in patients with high risk for surgical risk. Aorticvalve area increases from 0.5 mm to 0.8 m. At two years' follow-up, survival is 64.9 %) for transapeical patients. Short-term outcome is similar between the two devices. There are two competing third generation transCatheter Heart Valves available in the U. S.; however, there is no evidence of any difference in short-lived mortality or stroke among these two technologies."
29596495,"The results of a pharmacist's intervention to improve blood pressure in patients with Type 2 diabetes show significant improvements in both groups. In addition, there are no differences in the quality of care between the two treatment groups at 12 month intervals. A pharmacist-led approach to improving blood sugar was found to be more effective than other approaches. For example, an eight-week program consisted of four weekly group sessions and five monthly booster group session. At six months, significant improvement from baseline was seen in exercise, foot care, and goals attainment for A1C,LDL-C; but not in control arm. This study examined whether ""clinical inerty"" could contribute to improved blood glucose levels in type 2 patients managed in primary care centers. It was concluded that this practice model did not have any significant effect on patient health. However, it was reported that case management can improve behavior change and Glycemic controls in Chinese with type 1 diabetes. There was no significant difference in three categorical variables before and after: self-evalated psychological conditions, overall self evaluationated health condition, diet score, physical activity length per week, regular blood Sugarmonishing, waistto-hip proportion / diasolic bloodpressure and fastingblood sugar. After 24 months changes were observed in all three categories of variable: subjective graded items, objective measurements health indiceses and health serviceutilisation. The management band demonstrated improvement in these measures. When 100 older adults who gave informed permission were rand and ommly assigned into manage and control groups, they were divided into two groups according to their severity of disease. Both groups showed marked improvement over the following 18 months. They also showed reductions in Hba1c, blood concentration, body massindex, weight loss, smoking cessations, positive changes in belief about illness, as well as reduced mean SBP values. These studies suggest that trained community health nurses may be useful in providing culturally relevant support to patients suffering from Type 2, especially Hispanic subjects. Hepatoid patients underwent one of three six-month treatments designed to help them achieve their goal of improved health status, emergency departmentutilization, dietary habit, bodily mass index, hypertension, or anticoagulation. Their relative risk for cardiovascular events was determined by chart review. Thus, the aim of this trial was to examine how motivated patients will respond to risk factors when they are first introduced to new methods of treatment"
24698343,"In this study, we examine the effects of a high-fructose diet on fasting and postpranolgyc concentrations in men and women. We find no significant differences in body weight or blood lipid levels between the two groups. After change of diet, there were no changes in glucose, insulin, or ketonebodies. The subjects were fed either their usual diet with 1,000 kcal additional glucose per day or with addition of 500 kical extra fruit for 5 days each. This study concludes that ""friscoses seem to be responsible"" for the impaired Insulin binding and Insulsensitivity caused by sucrose. A crossover design was used to determine the effect of consumption of both sugars on energy expenditure and substrate utilizaton. Consumption did not lead to significant changes over time; however, fructosic consumption led to decreases of Net Postprand and Ial Plasma Triacyl Glycerol Concentrations. Both consumed meals reduced resting energy requirements but neither consumed more than 100 mg/day. Fifteen adults with Type 2 diabetes were studied. They underwent an Oral glucose tolerance test twice at least one week apart. No difference in leptenin concentration was found between these two treatment regimens. However, it was noted that sweeteners had little effect on appetite."
10716002,"In this paper, the 5-year results of a single-patient, multi-cranial study of posterior composite restouratives are reported. The material used is similar to those used in regular patients; however, there are slight differences in the size and type of restorations that may be related to local variation in method. Thirty adults with at least Four cervical lesions receive one restoration of either Ketaic-Fil, finished immediately, Celon-Fil or Chelonic-FIl, finishes after ten years, and then Cervident, an all-glass-ionomemer cement, is used. Two examiners assess the patient's condition after 10 years. There are no significant differences between the materials used and the extent of their use. A total of 8310 restoration pieces were placed in group A, 1281 among other groups, while 500 were assigned to group C. Both dentists originally put 134 amalgam replacements in 23 consecutive patients. This study was designed to evaluate the factors of setting rate/eames working on fracture atthe margins of various types of amalgams. After calculating the mean age of the restoreds, it was found that they were acceptable for long-term use as well as being less likely to fail. However, some patients had higher failure rates than others because of caries and technical defects. These patients also had longer periods of time to observe more closely. Chi- square analysis showed that the effect of operator and age and Caries activity were the main cause of failure. Conclusive studies were made to determine whether these patients could be classified as having ""high failure rate"" or ""low failurerate"" respectively."
19025503,"This paper describes the quality of a number of controlled trials and reviews that have been published since then. The main outcome measures are Adherence To the Guideline, measured through means of individual patient's forms recording the treated treatment completed bythe physiotherapist. A cluster-rand-omised control trial compares an active strategy on patients' physical functioning, coping strategies, and beliefs about their low back Pain. In this study, it is found that women receive more than 6 sessions per week, which suggests that there may be some improvement in the efficacy of this type of intervention. However, other studies have found conflicting results; for example, one study has suggested that education might be more effective than simply disseminating clinical practice guidelines."
28942899,"In this study, we examine the efficacy of a patient-centered practice improvement program for physical therapy in patients with upper extremity pain. We conclude that it is more effective than the standard case discussion approach on adherence by physicians to the American College of Physicians' Guideline for Physical Therapists. The results of the study indicate that there is no significant difference between the two groups during follow up. However, quality improvement strategies need to be improved before they can be used effectively. A cluster-randomed controlled trial was designed to assess the effect of an intervention consisting of self-reflection and awareness measures as well as knowledge and behavior measures. It was found that the intervention group had better scores on all three quality indicators than did the control group. This paper also discusses the importance of opinion leaders disseminating new evidence into medical practice."
10796834,"A prospective, observational study comparing the frequency and pain of postoperative discomfort in women with a myomas-induced uterine rupture. In this group, patients experienced less pain at the end of the surgery than in the expectants. The results suggest that laparoscopic nerve ablation can be an effective treatment for painful menstrual symptoms. This paper reports on two different surgical approaches for treating primary endometriotics: conservative surgery and presacral neuronectomy. Although both methods result in significant pain relief, they are not as effective as one another."
30627441,"In this study, the authors describe the use of bipolar fractional laser to treat scars. They conclude that both treatments are safe and effective. The results show a significant increase in the severity of each patient's scarring at three months after the first treatment. A further study is performed to determine the safety and effectiveness of two different types of therapy for treating acne: 1) single-pass pulsed light molecular ablation; and 2) double pass photoneedling. Both methods have similar efficacy. However, there is some evidence that they do not work as effectively as other approaches. For example, patients with lighter skin may experience more pain than those with darker skin."
24841177,"The reviewers agree on a set of ""domains"" that adequately address all of the potential biase concerns. For example, those with greater strength have less knee pain but better physical function than followup. In this study, we examine the effect of exercise on patients suffering from knee osteoarthritis. We find no significant difference in pain or function between control and intervention groups. However, there are some limitations to the use of these domains as predictors of outcome."
12804458,"The mean Hba1c level of the control group is 0.089, which is not significantly different than the mean value at baseline. In this study, the effect of support group participation on quality of life in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes is examined. After 6 months, there is no significant difference in pre-test scores and self-assesessment of well-being between the intervention groups. However, those who adhere to an education program are more satisfied with it than before. This study compares the effects of two types of patient education: one that involves physicians and another that uses a combination of telephone call and home visit. Both groups improve their knowledge but have little effect on health care satisfaction. A six-month cluster visit system for adults with type 1 disease improves glyceric control, selfefficacy, and patientsatisfaction. Two hundred forty eight English-and Spanish-speaking adult patients receive regular visits to Countess Laurie's medical center. These patients attend five 90-min group sessions each day during the first six months. They lose more weight after diagnosis and are better controlled by improved blood glucose levels. At follow up, all patients report improved health-related qualities of living; they also report reduced hospital stays. Nurse cases increase renal screening rates. Home-base management for newly diagnosed diabetic patients can results in better metabolic controls and similar psychological outcomes compared without notable effects upon social costs."
27374001,"In this study, patients with a total hip replacement are compared to those who have no restrictions on their movement during the first three months of their recovery. They show greater pain relief after TUG testing than they do after walking in the secure track device. A prospective, observational study is performed to determine whether or not pre-operative therapy can reduce the risk of dislocation from prosthetics following total knee replacement. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether patient education and post-surgery instructions can be used to improve quality of life for patients receiving primary total shoulder surgery. All patients show improvements in function and satisfaction at the end of the treatment period. Pre-operating class and booklet were found to have the most impact on cost and length of stay; however, these changes seemed to lead to improvement in other measures of health such as improved scores on the American Kneosis Questionnaire and reduction in fear of falling. These results suggest that there may be an advantage in using preventative measures rather than restrictive ones when it comes to treating hip injuries."
28589531,"Ninety two patients with Type 1 diabetes were enrolled in a controlled trial. The results showed that the intervention group was not more effective than expected after 14 months. A comprehensive program that integrated lifestyle counseling based on motivated interviewing principles, integrated into structured treatment did not alter blood pressure or the behavior related to diet nor physical activity. This study compared two adapted version of the efficiacious Look Ahad Intensive Life Intervention, b/m and c/omized control trials taking place in Hong Kong. In this paper, we describe the first translation from the Look-Hahead ILI for the military setting, which is one of only two such studies in the field. Although an increase in obesity similar to civilian population has been observed, there have had few rand and Omised controlled trials evaluating behavioral weight loss treatments in general. There are no differences in body weight, Hb1c, selfefficacy, health status, emergency departmentutilization, food habits, physical exercise, and medicine adherence. Both web-based and print material intervention were effective in improving physical activities; they also improved the quality of life amongst hispanic patients who had newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes. They also showed improvements in their own self-efficiecity. After 6 month of follow- up, the HgA1C level was significantly reduced in both groups. These results suggest that physicians should be more concerned with patient safety when it comes to managing type 2 disease."
29219092,"In this paper, the authors examine the association between early childhood exposure to televised entertainment and child behavior. They conclude that children are more likely to lose weight rapidly when others smoke than when they are alone in the household. A second study suggests that smoking is associated with changes in body mass-index and height at three years of age. The results suggest that there may be a relationship between late-night or early-afternoon watching and increased risk of overweight among children. This study also uses feigned parental involvement as an intervention for children who have been exposed to excessively long hours of sitting indoors."
30388164,"The results of this study indicate that carrying out moderate physical activity for 30 minutes a week is associated with lower body mass index, lower BMI, and higher levels of exercise. Women in the Scottish community who were not meeting the recommended daily steps were significantly less likely to be overweight or obese than those who reported no step count. This suggests that walking for well-being may reduce waist circumference but not weight gain. A walk for health program was studied among low- active Scottish women and men from the Walking For Wellbeing in West intervention study. Although there was no association between step counts and neighborhood safety, it was found that both groups showed increased steps per day. In addition, they examined the relationship between perceived neighborhood safest and self-efficiecacy as well as differences between morning and night time steps. These findings suggest that an enhanced walking program could improve sitting behavior by reducing the frequency of weekly steps taken by high-active adults."
26164054,"In this study, we examine the effects of benzazepines on patients with posttraumatic-stress disorder. We find that early treatment is more effective than long-term sedation in improving patient health and safety. After a period of three days, 370 veterans are compared to those who were not substance abusers or drugged. The primary outcome was symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress disorder, anxiety, and depression after acute care unit discharge. Seven patients consented for light sion but one patient was error. This suggests further evidence that reducing the duration of ventilation while maintaining mental health or safety is beneficial. A single tertyary care center has been used to assess the effect of different types of therapy on trauma-related memories. Five sessions of virtual realities were augmented by D-cyclopserine 50mg or alprasolam at an introductory time. At postdose, the D Cycopserserin group had the highest cortisole reactivity during virtual reality scene. Between- session extinction learning did not improve outcomes for the placebo group. However, there were no significant differences in symptoms among the three groups. Furthermore, it was found that the total dose received during the hospital stay was related to PTSD symptoms. Although causation cannot be assumed, these results suggest that some factors associated with severe psychiatric disease may be involved."
22079932,"This paper describes a novel intervention for older adults who are experiencing depression. It is an evidence-based intervention that improves their health, function, and satisfaction at the expense of routine primary care. In addition, it provides insight into how the course will be used in practice. The authors present two cost-effective approaches to improving mental health: 1) pre-pregnancy home visits by nursemaids; and 2) post-primary care services delivered by midwifes. They conclude that there is no significant difference in the main outcomes between the two groups. However, they do find little impact on some of the other results. For example, children with low psychological resources are less likely to experience violence or sexual intercourse during their first three years of life. Furthermore, para professionals produce small effects that seldom achieve statistical or clinical meaning. Parents' meetings are particularly effective because they provide family members with direct access to information about their child's well-being. These studies also suggest that ""stackeding intervention components"" may be more cost effective when compared to traditional medical treatments."
23739312,"A relapse-prevention program is associated with modest, variable effects on the disability outcomes of primary care patients who are receiving antidepressants. Family-based psychoeducational treatment is more effective than maintenance morphine in treating bipolar disorder. In addition, families receive more positive behavior during their first year of treatment than those who do not receive such treatment. The cumulative probability for remaining well without symptoms is 57 p.m. at 1 year, 46 % at 2 years, and 35 to 58 percent at 5 years. Meditate has been shown to be an effective treatment for unipolar depressed adults. There are few rands or omished controlled trials on depression in adults, but no control group was found. Coping with depression course has shown great efficacy in the treatmentof depressive patients. Although there were some differences in caseness, symptoms, etc. among the different groups, they all showed significant improvements in patient adherence to medication. Relapse prevention is especially important in patients with chronic depression that have not yet recovered from their initial bout of depression."
19148113,"In this paper, we describe the effects of early occupational therapy on infants who are prematurely weighed and have very low birth-weight. The intervention group has a lower incidence of development delay than the control groups; however, they do have higher scores on mental and physical growth at age 3 and 12 months. This study also compares the care provided by an early childhood education program to that offered by one of the older federally funded child-preparation programs. Children who participate in the early learning program have better academic performance than those who receive conventional care. A recent Federal law allows for multidisciplinary assessment of infant's suspected of developing delays. Preparations for school attendance are conducted according to the Bayley scales of Infant Develpment. At least half of these children perform well in school during their first two years of life. However, there is no significant difference between preterm and term controls in general conceptual ability or verbal scores. For example, after 1 year of follow-up, babies with high levels of involvement in home-based early education show improved behavior and brain development. These results suggest that early intervention may have positive effects on the intelligence of newborns born less than 32 week gestational weight."
31210136,This paper presents a cost-effectiveness analysis of the use of an idle force mechanization device to predict the risk of sudden thrombosis in patients with chronic obstructive heart disease. The results suggest that this device can be used to reduce the need for frequent outpatient visits and improve patient satisfaction.
24099581,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights focuses on the effect of a fall prevention program on balance and executive function in elderly patients who have spinal cord injury. The results suggest that an exercise program can be used to prevent falls among elderly people with severe injuries. This study is based on two groups: one group uses walking aids while the other group controls activities because they are afraid of falling. Fallers are more likely to fall than non-falling individuals. A cross sectional mail survey collects information about falls from all community residents. After adjusting by covariates, having fallen was significantly associated with greater number of medical conditions, greater numbersof days with poor health, and the restrictions of community activities due to fear of felling. These findings lead to the conclusion that wheelchair-related incidents are common but that there are few functional measures used for predicting these events."
28202713,"In this single-centre study, 30 patients with severe deficiencies of vitamin D showed a reduction in cold symptoms in the group receiving daily doses of 1,500 ng.m. This was followed by another trial in India wherein the rate of coldness did not differ among groups; however, among African American's, those receiving only one weekly dose of 1,000 IU/day were more likely to experience an episode of ""cold"" than those who received only 5,000 u.g. The rate and severity of chills were not different between groups but were increased among black Americans.

26777297,"In this study, we examine the association between drug use and the onset or severity of recent-settled psychosis. We find that patients who abuse or misuse drugs have more frequent relapse after one year than those who do not. This suggests that there may be a relationship between substance use disorder and mental health in patients with early-onset schizophrenia. A prospective population-based cohort study is performed in Germany to assess the effect of change in cannabis consumption on symptoms and function. The results suggest that people who use it are at increased risk for developing later-stage psychotic symptoms. However, they also show greater frequency of occurrence of these symptoms when compared to other individuals who don't use alcohol or other drugs."
28919929,"The current study focuses on the effects of an exercise program for older adults. It is shown that a one-year exercise regimen will lead to greater levels of growth factors, such as brain-derived nerve factor BDNF, insulinlike growth factor Type 1, and vasodiphosphorylating VEGF. This results in improved motor performance and learning in older subjects. In addition, it shows that younger subjects perform better and have greater learning than their older counterparts. A second study examines changes in motor skill during exercise training. Both groups show significant improvements in memory and motor skills after 12 months. Athletic training has also been shown to increase hippocampals in elderly subjects; this is particularly true because of the hemipox associated with age-related grey matter decline. Another study investigates the effect of dancing on motor control in healthy older men. Although there are no significant differences between the two groups, dance seems to be more effective in improving physical function than other forms of exercise."
20374659,"This paper focuses on the effects of mignobustion on both the cerebellar and mental systems. It is shown that acupuncture can induce an ""integrated response"" of the human nervous system to it, which correlates with its psychophysical response. The study concludes by describing a meta analysis of all randomized controlled trials in English from January 1998 until July 2008. There are only seven studies included in this meta-analysis; however, there is nonetheless sufficient evidence regarding its efficacy. In this paper, we assess the sideeffects and acceptance of treatment for patients with advanced malignant tumors. Two separate studies compare the local control of NPC or neck lymphnodes over two weeks with the effect of combined gyliu therapy. These studies show that the combination of these two treatments results in improved pain scores and reduced tongue figure scores."
27082571,"The Swedish Trial In Old Patients with hypertension. This is a prospective, open-label study to compare the efficacy of three active and one placebo-based regimens on the risk of fatal or nonfatal Stroke and Myocardial Ion and other Cardiodevalination in old Swedish patients over 84 years. After six months, blood pressure was reduced by 29 mmHhg for the first time. A reduction in stroke was also observed. Major cardiovascular complications were reduced in the active treatment groups; however, there was no significant effect of perindoprimil or indapacine on cognitive or social or general assessment in patients affected by multinibular disease. Vascular Dementia is an important cause of mental disability in western countries. Although specific drugs are not yet approved, certain drugs have not received approval yet. For example, amlorodipine has been shown to be superior to atenosoll in reducing major cardiovascular events in those with high risk for these events."
27495104,"In a double blinded, randomed, placebo controlled clinical trial in Washington, D. C., we examined whether Lactobacilus casei-DN-114 1 could reduce the frequency of common infectious disease and change of behavior due to illness in children. The incidence rate for Common Infections was 19.1 compared with that of thecontrol group. Affected children were 638 healthy children who had at least three bouts of ear, nose, and throat or gastrointestinal illnesses during the previous year. No significant differences occurred between the two groups; reported symptoms were similar among active/control groups. Children in both groups had fewer than one sickness day loss because of illness. Further studies are warranting further investigation into probiotics' efficacy in preventing common cold and fever in schoolchildren. Probiotic consumption is associated with reductions in the risk of epidemics from infants before the age 7 months. However, there is no evidence against proliferating these infections in sick children as they do not respond well to other treatments."
28459121,"We examine the physical, visual, health, and cognitive ability of 1,656, older adults as prospects i v predictors for self- reported driving cessations over a five-year period. Age, age, heart failure, slowness of processing, poorer performance, congesive heart fail, or stroke are risk factors for stopping driving. The summary performance test has excellent reliability but is sensitive to change in subjects who suffer an incident medical condition, stroke, hip fracture or CHF during follow-up. A prospective cohort study among 1,002 elderly women follows every 3 months with telephone interviews to assess their functional decline, new hospitalizeds, vital status, changes in symptoms after they leave the hospital, including increased severity of daily living difficulties and greater risk of death at follow up. In this study, more than half the older population reports having at least two motor vehicle crashes during the previous year. This study uses multiple methods to determine which measure is most likely to be associated with driving ceasesation. Most significant changes were found in gait speed, Short Physical Perceptive Battery, SpPB, 6 minute walk distance, Self-reported Mobility. These results suggestthat cardiovascular fitness is related to the sparing brain tissue in old adults."
29392334,"Pre-optractive pain, shoulder function and quality of live were measured with standing and ardmedical care. In the experimental group, there was no change in lung function or improvement in qualityof life. The results are similar to those of the control group. After three months, the short form 36 physical component score improved by 4.8 points for the experiment group than the controls at 3 months. All patients received sterile medical and nursing services. A physiotherapist-directed post-operative exercise program led to significant improvements in pain and shoulders function over usual treatment for patients following an open thorncotomy. This intervention was followed by an interrogation of 21 patients who completed the intervention. At this point, only two patients were excluded because they did not attend all their scheduled exercises. Outcome Measures: Preparatively and upto 3 month postoperatively painful was measured; a numerical Rating scale, Shoulder Pain/Disability Index, and Quality of Life with the Shortform 36. Trival Regration AnzCTRN 126005000201673 Conclussion A ""physiotherapist-direct post surgical exercise"" program resulted in substantial benefits in patient pain as well as shoulder functions over normal care for subjects following open chest surgery. Post-operational assessment was performed on both groups. For comparison purposes, we compared changes in anxiety and depression between time 1 and time 2 in patients with non-smallcell lung disease. These patients had adequate levels of physically active activity, shorter periods of chest tuberculosis, longer stay in hospital, but none of them showed any complications. Purpose The purpose of study was to determine the effects of progressive walking program on physical activity -- exercise tolerance, recovery, etc. -- after resection of lung tumors. Seventeen percent had Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Material & Methods There were several pilot trials that reported the effect of inspiratory Muscle training on pre-operatory functional capacity and end-Operative morbidity among patients treated with lung cancer."
29762708,"The Child Grant program, a government-run cash transfer program for orphaned and vulnerable children, has not been shown to have any significant impact on school attendance. However, the CGP does have some positive effects on maternal health in terms of improved access to health services. In particular, it has led to declines in sexual activity among young women after just one years of program implementation. A conditional cash transfers program called the Zomba Cash transfer is used to target young girls in Malawi that provide incentives to current schoolboys and recent dropsouts to return to school. This program also reduces early marriage, pregnancy, and self reported sexual activities among its beneficiaries. Although there are promising evidence from small scale grants in Africa that such programs may have positive affects on adulthood, there is no concluding evidence against them. For example, this study finds that the poverty- targeted unconditional cash payment program can have an important effect on improving mental health outcome of young people aged 6 to 24 years who attend school at least eighty percent of the time. There is little difference in depressive symptoms between the control group and the intervention group; however, these results do not seem to be statistically significant. These results suggest that poverty focused cash loans might have beneficial effects upon youth's mental well being."
24633256,"In this paper, we use a risk-stratefying approach to predict the risk of stroke for patients with thrombophilis. We find that women are at greater risk than men when it comes to warfarin consumption. This is due in part to the high frequency of major bleeding among women who take aspirin."
30151552,"In this study, Hamilton et al. demonstrate that the use of physical activity as a treatment for chronic fatigue in patients with fyphoid fever is more effective than conventional therapy in reducing fatigue severity and improving quality of life. The results are compared between two treatments: Mrt or CBT. At 26 weeks, the mean difference in fatigue was - 3.02; P = 0.051 at 26 week and 5.00 at 52 weeks. Outcomers were assessed priorto treatment and at 12 month follow-up. This trial will provide information regarding the effectiveness of self-regulfing exercise in acutely ill patients who have been assigned to one of two treatment regimens."
31337389,"In this study, we investigate the acute effects on blood glucose tolerance and appetite regulation in patients with Type 2 diabetes after a paleolithic type diet. After three meals, subjects were divided into two groups: one group was assigned to follow the WHO's recommended Paleolite diet and the other was given an American Heart Association-recommended Mediterranean-type diet for 24 months. The results showed marked improvement in glyceric control and reduced dietary energy consumption in both groups. We also investigated whether reducing body weight could improve memory performance in overweight and obesity women. Both groups had similar changes in brain activity during meal times. They also found improvements in fat mass and activity as well as improved gene expression of lipogenesis. This study is important because it will allow us to compare different types of diets that have been used for various diseases."
27157250,"In this study, the authors report that a combination of berbeine, poliosanolic, red yeast Extract, and astraganthin significantly reduces total cholesterol and low-dental lipoprotein levels in patients with moderately high-risk hypolipidemia. They conclude that these ""nutraceuticals"" can be used to improve both lipid profile and risk of heart disease in elderly patients who are hypercholesteremic."
21791456,"This study focuses on clustering of risk factors in schoolchildren from three countries: Denmark, Estonia, and Portugal. The results suggest that exercise training may be an effective strategy for reducing the risk of heart disease in overweight children. In addition, it reduces blood pressure and body weight in young adults who are at least moderately fit. Atheroscetic disease is more common in males than in females; only men have a strong association with total risk from early childhood to adulthood."
24314347,"In this paper, we describe a group-based study of 20 patients with ADHD who are treated before treatment and after twelve months. The results suggest that the dopaminergic effects of single dosages of methylphini date or an overdose of attenuating atomoXetine are associated with improved performance on the go-nogo test in both groups. We also examine the effect of methylphodate on time perception in children with hyperactivity disorder."
27150167,"In this study, we examine the effect of an education-based intervention on physicians' ability to prescribe appropriate treatment for patients who have a fracture. The odds ratio is 1.29 in favor of treating them with conservative treatment and 1.41 in favorable risk. We investigate whether sending reminders by mail will lead to improved patient care. Physicians received only one or two reminder messages per week during the intervention period. This trial was conducted in Canada from June 2008 until May 2010. It showed that there was no significant difference in the rate at which physicians were asked to perform bone mineral dentition tests or start pharmacology treatment. A further study was carried out in Germany where all general practitioners were invited to participate in either workshop or decision tree meetings. There was not evidence of any change in practice behavior over the course of the 12 months following the initial intervention. Both groups had different levels of health service utilization, prescriptions, and physical activities. For example, patients receiving cortison injections increased significantly than those receiving usual care; however, they did not receive any improvement in their quality of life. Furthermore, these results suggest that continuing medical education may be more cost effective than regular physician training."
29858467,"Walking is shown to be a good strategy for improving health in older adults. In this study, we examine the effect of three-hour walking sessions on self-regard, physical activity, and mental well-being. The results suggest that walking improves both mood and anxiety in elderly people. A walk program with an eight-week duration appears to have some positive effects on psychological well being."
29325567,"This paper focuses on the effects of frailness on elderly patients who undergo elective surgery. It uses a 7-point scale to predict the risk of death and complications in older patients. The results suggest that preoperative fatigue is associated with increased risk for major post-opportunities, particularly in those with high energy or physical demands. In addition, there are no significant differences between the severity of injury and the length of stay after surgery; however, some patients have functional declines out to one year. A prospective cohort study was conducted to determine whether early detection of delirium could be used to prevent future complications from occurring. Although this study did not find any specific association between poor health and reduced function, it found that men were more likely as well than women to develop strokes. Frailties were also observed in several patients during the first few days of their operation. Post-operative anxiety was especially important in these patients because they had higher levels of preoccupation with mortality and long hospital stays. Preoperative exercise tolerance was an independent predictor against further complications."
25691348,"This paper focuses on the use of the food-addiction scale as a tool to assess eating disorder and other health problems. It is based on three factors: 1) self-regard, 2) uncontrolled eating, and 3) emotional eating. The results show that severe bingeers tend to set up their diets which are unrealistically strict but report low efficacious expectations to sustain them. In addition, the Eating Motivation Survey has been refined for use in weight loss research."
25380104,"The results of this study indicate that there is no peri-operative death or neurologic deteriorations after the surgery. Thirty four patients are enrolled in the Dura-Splitting Decompression trial, which has been shown to be safe and efficacious. A further study is performed on children with ChiariI malformation who underwent decompressives. This study uses a modified version of the Scorer for Measurement of Functional Capability developed by Dr. Barlow. It is clear that it is not possible to predict the outcome of these procedures without using pre-operating magnetic resonance imaging."
24146670,"This study aims to compare the efficacy of two different types of pulp dressings on primary morals. The first is mineral trioxidize aggregate, or MTA; the second is formocresole, which has a higher failure rate than either type. After six months, only one failure occurs in both groups. In this study, the aim of this paper is to use histologic and clinical examinations to determine the relative success between gray mineraltrioxide aggregate-MTA, white cement-Fullotomy agents, and formcocresol as ""pulp dressing agents"" in primary teeth treated with carous pulp exposure. Histological results indicate that Gray Mineral Trioxidise Aggregate appears to be more successful in treating primary tooth resorption than it does in using formso Cresol."
31818038,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates the use of a new in-vitometry technique to evaluate the efficacy of an endodontic crown sealer in rats. The results suggest that the new technique may be more sensitive to the localized cytotoxics of the different sealers than it is to those of conventional filling materials. This study also focuses on the role of pre-clinical research in improving the quality of animal intervention studies."
26430947,"In this paper, we describe the effects of an early-adolescence behavior intervention on children with autism. For children who are beginning treatment with their lowest language levels, the behavior program improves language outcome more than does the eclectic treatment or a combination of both groups. The behavioral group is better at following-up than an eclectic group; however, they do not show any social problems after two years. This study further extends evidence that early childhood intervention can be used to improve long-term outcomes in young children's development. Children receive Early Start Denver modeling for 2 years and EEG activity is measured during face-versus-object presentation. Acute separation-reunction episodes also reveal significant gains in attachment-related behavior. Later, studies have shown that infants with severe autistic disorders exhibit significant deficitin imitation skills. ReciProcal Imitations Training has been developed to teach younger children how to imitate when they are playing. These studies suggest that it is possible to use imitation training to increase social engagement between parents and children without increasing parental stress. At the National institutes of health in 2002, several papers were presented discussing methodological challenges of conducting research in psychosociety in Autism Spectrum disorder. One paper was published in the journal of the American Society for the Education of Young Children with Autism. It reports that there are no significant differences between genders in Autmatic Spectrum Disorders but that neither age nor severity of symptoms change little over time. Two other articles report that parent-child relationship improvement is improved by early intervention. Parents receiving early start Denver model showed greater working alliances as well as stronger working relationships with her therapists. Another article describes the effectiveness of ""JASP/ER"" for improving communication in pre-schoolchildren with mild to moderate intellectual disability. Preparations for these studies are still lacking. Although some authors claim that practice requires multiple intervention strategies, others argue that only discrete intervention methods may be effective."
27778435,"In this study, we report the results of a single-dose, open-label trial in which patients with knee pain received 100 milligrams of epicutaneous drug IDEA-023, versus placebo for relief. This was more effective than the other two groups at reducing pain and improving function. The mean change in pain scores from week 0 to week 12 was significant; however, there were no serious side effects. Only low quality trials have been published that show safe and efficacious use of topicals."
27568654,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective study of men with elevated free-serious PSA. We conclude that there is no significant reduction in disease-specific death among patients with high risk for prostate cancer who receive short-term adjuvant therapy after 4 months before treatment. The use of short term adjuted therapy was associated with reduced disease specific mortality and increased Overall survival. After 9 years, the incidence of adverse events was thirteen7 p.m.; however, all patients were biochemical or clinical failurefree at 5 years. Acute and Late-Radiation-Induced Toxic effects were similar between the two arms. Pre-planned analysis on the efficaciousness and sideeffects of an rand and ommized trial compared conventional and hypofracated radiotherapy had 5 year follow-up. At least half of the patients are Biochemical or Clinical failure free at five years: 883%. 873 %) in the 73 Gy group, 895 % inthe 60 Gy groups, and 809 /834 0% in those with advanced disease. This report is published by the Dutch Cancer Society. Prostate tumors have been detected during the pre-Phase III era, but it is not recommended to be treated because of overdiagnosesis. Men with localized prostatectomy are more likely to die from their disease than they are assigned to observation. Although radical prostratectomy does not significantly reduce overall survival, it has been reported that transrectal biopsy is superior to transcertal biopsy when performed as per the recommendations of American Society for Medical Therapeutic Radiology And Oncology. Postoperatively rebuffed regimens do not improve long-lived survival either. However, several trials have shown better outcomes when RT is combined with rogen suppressment."
30844015,"This study evaluates the effects of a nine-month horseback riding program on social functioning among children with autistic spectrum disorder. In this paper, we examine the effect of an eight-week intervention on improving social function in patients with severe autism. We conclude that horses can be used to treat these children because they exhibit greater sensory seeking, sensing, and motivation than other types of treatment. The results suggest that treating animals with imitation may lead to improved social functions in children who have mild to moderately severe Autism."
28236127,"The aim of this study is to determine physician and patient rated treatmentadherence with osteoporrosis treatments, and to evaluate factor influencing compliance. This study was designed to assess the influence of group-based education on knowledge of the condition in patients with previous fractures. Although there were no differences between age or score at entry, the higher level of education increased the gain in Knowledge during the course. In the control group, only the lower level had an increase in knowledge. At the same time, it was found that the greater the knowledge score reflected inversely from the levelof education. A group's multidisciplinary education program significantly increases patients' knowledge about the disease. It was tested at enterence and at three months using validated date d questions naire. When the results were entered, no difference in age nor score were observed between the school group and control groups. However, almost 40 percent of patients had previously fractured; 25 % did not have any fracture or dual energy x- Ray absortiometric detection. Fractures occurring during their 1-year follow up period were recorded. European observational one year study assessed Osteoperosus and fracture patterns among 3,402 Postmenopaausal women who prescribed Ostex medication. Results Of 1,401 women enrolled, 39 th of whom had a prior fracture. ConclusionAlmost 40 0% of those patients prescribed Osteoprasis medication had already suffered another fracture."
27378255,"Preschool children's physical activity is measured over a four-year period. Children in the highest BMI group are more physically active during the day and on weekends than those in other groups. This study aims to investigate the relationship between physical activities and preterm birth, vegetation, and weather. The results of this study suggest that early childhood education is not as effective as it could be. In contrast, parents who work part-time or attend school full time are less likely to become overweight. A family-based exercise intervention is shown to improve physical health among children living in American Indian communities."
20969769,"The risk of a fracture in women with bone mass below the threshold is estimated by using an age-specific model. A 50-year old white woman's lifetime risks of hip fracture are calculated based on measurements of her radially bone mineral density at age 50. This estimate is used to predict the lifetime risk for hip injury and mortality. Over 80 percent of family physicians want to be informed about bone density testing and the management of Osteorosis. In this study, we assess the effect of physician-directed intervention on the rate of treatment of patients who have been treated with alendronates or placebo. There were no significant differences in the probability that the primary composite outcome was either BMD tests or Ostoporoseis medication. Men who received placebo experienced no changes in lumbbar spine or total body Bone mineral Densitometric results were observed. Women with low bone Mass and existing vertebrol fractures had reduced the frequency of these fractureds by 39 %) compared with those with higher bone masses. Physician-directive intervention increased the use of bisphosphonic drugs but did not increase the proportion of subjects receiving appropriate care."
14670881,"The aim of this study is to compare the effects of three different post-operative physiotherapies on the risk of complications after chest surgery in patients with chronic airway limitation. Although no significant difference is found between the three treatments, there is a tendency for the decrease in risk due to the addition of inspiratory resistatory pressure and positive expiratory force. This suggests that physical therapy may be more effective than mechanical therapy in reducing pre-opportunity for postoperative complications following heart surgery."
25754617,"In this paper, the effects of low-dose oestrosal therapy on vaginal symptoms are examined. The results indicate that there is no significant difference in the severity of urinital symptoms after treatment with either type of medicine. After 10 weeks, both groups improve their vaginal pH and lactobacili levels. Urogenical symptoms improved in all groups after medication but only after the medication free period. This study concludes that ""the incidences of stroke did not differ among assigned ralxfene or placebo."" For all strokes, it was 1.37 for CEE than placebo; for all risk factors, including older and more recently womenopausally women, they were higher in treated regimens. A double blind trial showed that combined HRT reduced bone mineral denition at the hip as well as other clinically relevant sites. Women who received combination HTT reported hot flushing, night sweatses, aching muscles, insomnia, and vagonal discharge. These studies suggest that these two types of treatments can be used to improve health related qualities of life. Estrogent replacement therapy has also been shown to reduce the risks of new breast cancer. Two trials have been performed by the Women's Health initiative: one in which 1,500 women are enrolled and another in an observational program where about 100,000 women will be involved. All patients receive conjugated progestine plus acetate during the first three years of followup. Although some changes are seen in blood lipid level, such as increased lipoprotein content, others are not observed. Postmenophausal Hormonious Hormone Therapies -- PHT -- comprised of two doubleblind, placebo controlled trials in post menopalsal women aged between 50 and 78 years. They are designed to compare the effect of estrogen alone and estrogen together with prostagminist/hormone therapy. No evidence exists for the benefits of long-term use of cordial hormone therapy near the end of pregnancy."

24306266,"This paper focuses on the use of qualitative methods to examine the efficacy of physiotherapies in patients with knee osteoarthrits. The results suggest that health professionals should include ""qualiary research within trials wherever levels of compliance might have an impact upon the effectiveness of this intervention."" Osteoartritis, a common but often disadventuresome condition, is frequently misunderstood by older adults. Although physical health factors are the primary indications of an older patient's overall involvement in the program, it was not the psychological factors most important to adhere to the home-based regimen. In contrast, pain and stiffness are believed to be inevitable aspects of age rather than disease. These findings were obtained from face-toface interviews with 31 patients who had been previously treated for OA. They found that expectations of total knee surgery were linked to their knowledge of the treatment and its outcome. Furthermore, they found significant differences between six personal model constructs: symptoms, seriousness, cause, control, helpfulness of treatment, and negative feelings about treatment."
31073341,"The aim of this study is to determine whether pedometer technology can be used as an aid to improve physical activity in older adults with chronic obstructed pulmonary disease. This paper concludes that the superior potential of dancing over walking upon executive functions of elderly people was not supported. A total of nine88 older women were invited into three different British family practices and were assigned either a ""life-physical activity intervention group"" or control group. These groups increased their daily steps by 16 p.m., while the average daily step count was 513 mm. In addition, they showed significant increases in the time taken to walk from accelerometers."
23235671,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed description of the predictars and modifier effects of response to tricyclo antidepresstants in patients with Major depressive disorder. They conclude that it is necessary for the patient to obtain at least 80 percent inhibiting platelet activity by taking amitripyline or another anti-psychotic. The results suggest that both drugs are effective in treating major depression. A double blinded trial compares trazondone with miansiner, an alprazolinic drug, in eighty-five women who have been suffering from major anxiety. Both drugs show significant improvement in their efficacy. However, they do not produce any significant changes in symptoms or quality of life."
28635182,"In this study, the effect of partial replacement of a high-sugar diet with an alpha-lainolic acid-enriched diet on plasma fatty acid levels was investigated in 20-nine young men. The changes occurred on the tinyleic acids-rich diet; but no significant difference in the changes to total cholesterol, LDLcholesterol, HDLcholestrol and the subfraction'sHDL2, and HdL3 or Triacylgallycerols are found. This suggests that flaixseed added into heathenary diet could be beneficial for reducing inflammation markers like CRP and Thf-."

We find no significant difference in response to Urotherapy only or urothérapie+tens compared to controls without previous treatment. The results are similar in age, gender and ethnicity. A further study is performed to confirm that propiverine is superior to placebo in treating patients with OAB. Children with symptoms of daywetting or nighttime inconvenience respond well to this intervention."
28941967,"In this study, the effects of an early-mortal mobilization regimen on wrist function and recovery after a fracture are compared with that of patients who receive conventional treatment. The results of these studies suggest that early mobilisation may be more effective in relieving pain and improving range of motion than traditional methods of therapy. A prospective, cross-over trial is conducted in which fifty patients with solitary fractures or volar plates are assigned to two different groups; one group is instructed to perform routine exercises at home while the other is given instructions for self-training. After six weeks, all patients improve their grip strength and improvement in shoulder function. This study concludes that ""everyday exercises"" can significantly improve the functional outcome of distal humerals."
24862702,"In this study, Dr. Rivers systematically compares the effect of an electric pex-locator alone or combined with a working length band on the extent of tooth filling. He concludes that using an electrode as an aid can reduce the number required to determine ""working length"" by comparing the results of two different methods. The first method is used in patients who do not need repeated exposure to light; the second method uses an analogy between the patient's teeth and the anatomy of the root canal. This paper also discusses how accurate the tri-antimium rotary file is in determining the final length of their root Canal preparation."
22071397,"This paper focuses on the efficacy and acceptability of an after school team sports program to reduce weight gain in overweight children. It uses a six-month, two-arm, parallel- group, pilot-retest design to assess the effects of physical activity on young African-American girls. The results indicate that active participation in community activities is associated with improved physical health outcomes for both boys and women. In addition, there are significant differences in behavior between females who are more physically active and those who do not. A further study investigates the association between physical exercise and fatness among adolescents from displaced Turkish families. Children from these families have lower energy and carbohidrate intake than their normal weight peers."
23369854,"In this paper, we report the results of a large, well-controlled trial in which patients with acute heart failure were telemonisted daily to determine whether an implantable device could reduce the number and severity of their hospitalizations. The results showed that there was no significant effect on quality of life or morbidity in the intervention group; however, it did lead to reductions in both the rate of death and readmission from the control group. Heart failure is one of the most common diagnoses among adults over age65 and translate into dramatic increased heart fail - associated morbity and mortality. Telemonitors can help implement and maintained effective therapy and prevent worsening hearts failure and its causes promptly to prevent medicine crises"
28447854,"In this paper, we examine the effects of eating habits on health behavior in a group of fifty-four middle-aged adults. We find that habit strength is important when explaining bad snacking behavior, but not when it comes to hunger. This paper also shows how self-regulfing training can be used to increase appetite and improve body mass in children. The results show that both groups are better able to control their appetites than an information only intervention. Both groups have similar increases in body weight over the first four months after the intervention; however, they do not show any changes in blood pressure or body fat."
24749160,"In this paper, the authors describe a double blinded study of 50-four healthy men and women who are 18 to 36. They assess the effects of three stimulants on memory, planning, and self-monitory performance. After 44 hours, they receive solitary doses of one of these three drugs or placebo. The results indicate that modafinill does not have any significant effects on either memory or behavior. However, it does improve response inhibition in adult ADHD patients. This effect is related to loss of awareness of performance mistakes. A cross-over analysis of 27 healthy subjects suggests that MAS may have no more than minor effects upon cognition in young adults."
27997982,"This study focuses on the effect of six different methods of enamel treatments on surface roughness, hardness and molecular structure. The first method results in an increase in surface toughness compared with the control group. After two weeks, color change values were recorded after various post-bleaching treatments. In this study, teeth were stained by tea solution and then placed in four groups. Next, it was application in group 1, fluoride, Naf 2 peroxide, gel for 2 minutes, and fractional CO2-laining agent; at home bleaching was done with 10 %) carbamide peroxite for two hour daily over the next course of three weeks. Color change measurements were submi'ttedto a two way repeated measures analysis of Variance and Tukey tests. Aim and Objectives The aim of these studies was to evaluate efficacy, colour stability, risk,and intensity of toothsensitivity -- TS -- of combined Bleacher treatment performed with 20 or 35  percent hydrogen peroxe as an in- office protocol. When both regimens were used, patients recorded their intensity using ten point verbal scale. Both procedures resulted in higher risk but did not cause any significant changes in the micromorphology of pearlized enamel. These studies are divided into several groups and each group contains 30 specimens. Each subject contained 30 subjects. Within 3 months, the surface quality had increased in Colgate Platinum, whereas those in Starbrite showed no such changes. Intraoral observation is carried out under laboratory conditions. Three vickers were performed upon each specimen according to the I.S.6507 - 399 eight specification. An experiment was conducted to compare the effects of home use bleacher agents containing16 % Carbidamide PeroxidE and in Office Bleling agent / 38 0% Hydrogen Perogene. It was concluded that there was no difference between the treated material and the untreated material. However, some experiments have taken place in vitro. All samples were mounted in retainers during the active period of the study. Ename blocks were prepared from freshly extracted teeth. They were subject to pre-and Post-treatment micro Hardness measurements. Pre- and Post Treatment Microhardness Measurements were obtained before and after treating enamel surfaces. Results were classified as either no or mild altered, moderate alterations, or severe altered surface. There were only slight differences among all groups"
26655787,"The effect of regular exercise on blood pressure, body mass, and lipids in patients with Type 2 Diabetes is investigated. In the intervention group, physical activity was shown to be an effective treatment for both glyceric control and cardiovascular risk factors. However, there was no significant change in other measures of control during the trial period. Furthermore, stroke was significantly reduced in the pre-intervention group compared to that of the control group. Precede health education model was a useful tool in improving metabolic control as well as the reduction of heart disease in type 2 patients."
17356688,"In this paper, we examine the effects of two different anticonvulsionsants on children with newly acquired epilepsy: pacifism-blocking drugs such as mephobbital and caramazepine; and ointment-based drugs like valproates. Although both drugs are effective in preventing seizures, they do not seem to have any significant side effects. A double blinded study compares single daily dose of hypobarbitum plus antipyrotic instructions to a group of placebo plus prophylactic regimens for preventive treatment of new febrile seizures. The results suggest that long-term treatment does not outweigh intermittent diazing. However, there is no difference in the frequency of subsequent seizures between the two treatments. Children treated with pytobarbigone or carbazzaze pine had significantly lower recurral rates than those given either drug. These results indicate that although some children may be susceptible to sideeffects from these drugs, it is not necessary to treat them directly."
30690935,"The effects of psychotherapy are not as significant as those of the intranasolal group. In contrast, oxtocin seems to have some role in modulating brain functions involved in self-centeredness and depression. This paper describes a double blinded, crossover trial where we give male subjects with major depressed disorder 40 iu/mil before an assessment of their mental health. They find that oxytopics cause an increase in anxiousness over the treatment session. We also examine the effect of social anxiety on mothers who have PND. After two days of this study, all women underwent neutral conversation. Oxt increases significantly in gossip than the emotional nongosip behavior. It is believed that it may be related to its biological functions: ""establishing group rules, punishing"" trepassers, ""exercising social influence through fameal systems,"" and ""forming and strengthening social bond."" However, no human study has examined the affects of OT within individuals with social anxieties. Arachnophophobia was investigated in healthy men by administering 24 IU per day or placebo. These results did not lead to any significant changes in mood or anxiety. Furthermore, they showed no change in the scores on the Fear of spiders Questionnaire."

It uses a prospective observational study to examine the effect of supervised exercise on people with chronic low back pain who have been referred for treatment by their general practitioners. The results suggest that there is little evidence of benefit from an exercise program, but it does indicate that certain aspects of the program may be more beneficial than others."
17258623,"In this study, the effect of a single-rooted premolar tooth on dentin leakage is investigated. The results indicate that the treatment of the teeth with either 15 % Edta or Naocl reduces the amount of invading pathogens while improving the bond strength. This study also determines whether the use of two different dentine bonding agents can be used to prevent bacterial growth."
22895954,"In this paper, the results of an eight-year, randomized, placebo-control study of elderly patients with mild to moderate hypertension are presented. The primary endpoint is a reduction in the risk of fatal or stroke for those treated with either treatment. A comparison of the effects of two different diuretic regimens on blood pressure is made. Both studies show that the use of bendro fluazide or propranosolol reduces the rate of death and major cardiovascular complications in older adults who have mildly elevated blood levels."
32292049,"This study focuses on acute effects of caffeination on endotheal function. In this paper, we examine the effect of coffee on blood pressure in healthy subjects. It is found that it increases blood flow and dilation but does not lead to any significant changes in other body functions. We conclude that coffee has an acutely  induce unfavoable cardiovascular effects, especially on endsothelially function as well as on large arteries. The aim of this study is to investigate the possible role of caffeine in improving post-shock response. Acupinated coffee leads to a greater increase in blood vessel stiffness than decaffeinated coffee. However, there is no significant change in heart function after consumption of both types of drink."
31522379,"In this study, we examine the effect of a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet on body weight and fat mass in women who are overweight. The results suggest that an increase in nutrient content may lead to improved blood pressure levels. We also report that these changes can be accompanied by changes in the expression of several different genes involved in inflammation."
32162242,"In this study, we examine the validity of a new neurocognition assessment tool, ImPACT, as used to predict symptoms after mild trauma. The results suggest that impatient concusses are more likely to report symptoms of vomiting and sadness than concocsed men. This study further investigates the relationship between post-concurssion scores and mental function in patients who have experienced traumatic brain injuries. We conclude that there is no significant difference in pre- or post injury performance on an instrument designed to assess neurocoustial function among African Americans and white high school andcollegiate student-athletes. Acute brain injury occurs frequently during contact sport and can lead to delayed recovery."
17526675,"In this study, Wuthering Heights demonstrates the utility of a novel needle-snack technique for studying the skeletal muscles in patients with severe obstrumental disease. The results suggest that the Bergström instrument may be more comfortable than the other two methods. Although Wuthringhöhe's technique does not differ significantly from the one used by Bergstrom, the agreement is moderate. This study investigates the relationship between muscle morphology, fiber type composition, and exercise tolerance among patients suffering from moderate to severe acute pulmonary disease as well as those who do not show any improvement in their health after an eight-week exercise training intervention."
26732899,"This paper focuses on the use of EMG to classify low back pain patients and to predict muscle fatigue in patients with chronic low-back pain. It also discusses some of the newer test procedures that have been developed for this purpose. These include an exercise regimen that involves passively contracting back muscles at a constant force over time. The results show that subjects contract their Back Muscles at 80 %) of their maximal Volcano Conduction Force, which is equivalent to those of healthy subjects. In addition, the study shows that there are two important relationships between the strength of these muscles and the pain they are subjected to."
28155204,"This paper reports on the results of a prospective, observational study of 247 patients with bipolar disorder. The subjects were divided into two groups: those with long-current episode duration and those who had low lifetime uses of mood stabilizers. Both groups had high frequency of core symptoms that were closely linked to their likelihood of being diagnosed with mania. These symptoms seem to be especially salient in children because they are related to other common childhood psychia."
23677421,"After 6 months, the value of pain, health assessment question naire disability and Auscan-H and osteoarthritis Index continue to be significantly improved in comparison with baseline values. In both treatment groups, C-Reactive Protein levels follow a declining tendency, which persists 3 months later. The effect of mineral water on patients with low back pain is studied. Changes are evaluated: pain intensity, functional capacity, quality oflife, use of anti-inflammatory drugs, subjective disease extent perceived by the patient, investigator-respected disease severity, and severity for pain perceivedby the patients. Both groups receive 30 minutes daily bathing in mineral waters. There is no significant improvement in pain or symptoms at six months. This study shows that balniotherapy is effective treatmentmodality in elderly people with knee Ostearthritis. It lasts for at least three months after treatment."
20451780,"In this study, the shear strength of a tooth-bonding system is compared to that of an enamel-bonded system. The results indicate that there is no significant difference in bonding strength between the two groups. A 35 p.H. hydrogen peroxe solution is used to bond orthodontic brackets directly to enamel while maintaining the same bond strength as the control group. Bond failures are also reported. After treating teeth with acid for 30 days, bonds are bonded immediately. Shear bond strengths are measured at 1 hour, 2 hours, and 3 hours. There are no differences in the survival rate of first-time bond failure among the three groups; however, they do not differ significantly from one another."
20795921,"A randomed controlled trial is designed to determine whether repetitive walking with weight-bearing support is more effective in improving gait speed in stroke patients than conventional physio therapy. The results of this trial are as follows: 1) the improvement in functional scores for people who have post-stroke improved by 47.3 vs. 26 m. at 1 month, 2) the improvements in gaits abnormality and tissue composition were maintained at 3 months after follow-up, and 3) 14 p.e. more of the experiment were discharged back from the study. In addition, 15 % of all the experimental participants were home during the first three months of their treatment. This was an important step in the development of new technology in rehabilitation. There are many studies that have been performed trying to find the best way to train people with acute stroke. However, these studies have failed to show any significant difference between the training methods. For example, one study showed that using a body-weight-based training program could lead to faster recovery in patients with severe stroke but did not result in superior performance in other patients. Another study examined the effect of exercise on gaited ability in adults with moderate stroke severity. It found no significant differences between groups at admission or at the 10 month follow up. Both groups received regular physical therapy except for the treadmill training. At the same time, there were no changes in FAC, Stroke assessment, or Berg's balance scale."
25000940,"The results of this study indicate that a combination treatment of physical therapy and patient education is more cost-effective than usual care in patients with Fibromyalsgia. In addition, there are no significant differences in pain or quality of life between the two groups after 3 months. A further study investigates the efficiacy of water-based exercise for patients suffering from fibroyalgic disease. This study uses pool exercises as an intervention to improve pain and fatigue in women with fagitalgies. There are only slight changes in both pain scores and symptoms after 6 months of follow-up."
27730178,"The group who trained the lower limb muscles showed a better improvement in the asthma scale, endurance test, and maximalstatic mouth pressure. A further study was performed on patients with severe obstruthive pulmonary diseases to determine whether adding exercise training to their rehabilitation program would improve quality of life. Both groups improved significantly in terms of exercise capacity and health status. In addition, both groups added resistance training for improving lung function. This study also examined the effect of multiple-set resistance exercises on strength and fitness outcomes in patients suffering from severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These results may have important implications for program design, application,and adherence in pr. Twenty-four Italian patients were recruited for this study. They were assigned to either one of three groups: group A receives upper or lower leg training; group B receive only upper and lower arm training. There was no significant differences in any outcome measures between groups except that subject who had both an acupuncture session and PR stayed less breathless after ten weeks. Furthermore, all patients received coaching duringtraining. All patients did not show any difference in most of these endpoints but that subjects who used hypnotism and/or breathing ventilation remained less breatheless for longer periods than they did before."
22211304,"In this study, the effect of a porous sponge on the healing of fresh tooth extraction sockets is investigated. The results suggest that it is possible to preserve the alveoolar ridge after root extraction by using clots and other methods. Sixteen subjects with two anterior teeth orbicotics participate in the study. Flap advancement prevents hard tissue loss during healing. Implants are placed at the start of extraction and then augmented with EPTFE barrier Membranes have favorable long term predictability. Histological analysis shows more bone in implants treated with hard material replacement than those treated without such material. After 6 months, histology shows no differences between new bone and native bone. Two concentrations of human bone-morphogenetic protege were used for the treatment of 40 patients. Both groups showed significant changes in their soft tissue margin following tooth removal. A combination of calcium sorption and bioactive glass was found to be advantageous in preventing further deformities from occurring."
28246695,"Back school therapy is a better form of exercise for patients with sacrailiac joint pain. A study evaluating the efficacy of back school in treating low back pain has been performed. In this study, subjects were divided into three groups: 1) an outpatient program; 2) another type of treatment; and 3) control groups. The results show that both groups improved their pain and disability during the first two years of follow up. This was especially important because it showed that patients had greater self-care knowledge than before. Another study examined the use of rehabilitative education to prevent workers from contracting lower back injuries. It found no significant difference between the intervention group and the control group on measures of pain or functional capacity after one year."
30657077,"The results of this study indicate that exercise is beneficial to women with a fibromyallygia condition. Women with the disease respond well to resistance exercise and improve their health status, pain severity, and physical function. They also report improved mental health and fatigue. A further sub-study was performed to examine the effect of progressive resistance exercises on multiple dimensionsof fatigue in women who have fags. This study included 67 women from the general population who were not eligible for resistance training. In addition, it revealed that strength training had an immediate positive effect on pain relief and improvement in functional status. Strengthening did not lead to improvements in other measures of health or quality of life. However, there were significant improvements among the strength groups.

31140441,"In this paper, we describe the results of a six-month observational study in which pharmacists identified and classified drug-retrieval problems among patients with no specific complaints. The primary outcome measure was an emergency severity score for patients who presented to the emergency department with ""non-specific complaints"" such as weakness or generalized weakness. This study is designed to improve care for older adults by identifying and categorizing DRPs according to pharmacist activities within their general practice setting. A new patient management model has been developed to help ensure that all patients are given appropriate medication regimens during their first month of hospitalization. No changes are found in 16 patients; however, most patients change their dosages without altering their treatment plan. Medicationadherence is measured using MedAdHIR-ST's individual review -screening tool. These studies will confirm some of these proposed causal relationships between drugs and other conditions but will not be repeated in long-term studies."
25149678,"This study focuses on the effects of six-month exercise program on knee pain and quality of living among patients with OsteoArtritis. The results suggest an improvement in pain, muscle strength, and bone mineral dentition after 6 months of vigorous exercise. In this study, subjects were divided into two groups: 1) conventional physical therapy; 2) CPM - ES combination; and 2) home-based exercises. Affected subjects improved their symptoms and function during the first eight weeks of the intervention. After the second eight-week period, they showed no significant improvements in either pain or performance. However, at the end of each trial, there was a significant reduction in both pain scores and functional capacity."
23122432,"This study compares the effect of an intense resistance training program on physical function in older women with chronic heart disease. The results suggest that exercise may be a useful tool for assessing functional capacity in these patients. In this paper, Gremeaux and Deley demonstrate that the 200-millimeter fast walk test is superior to the 6-minute walking test in patients with congestive chest disease at lower risk. They conclude that it is more accurate to measure performance after two weeks of vigorous exercise than after three months of restorative treatment."
23993035,"A prospective, i.e. long-term follow-up study of patients with low back pain that have failed to improve after conservative treatment is presented. In this paper, the results of two different types of disc replacements are reported. One group receives an anterior lumbbar interbodyfusion while the other receive only a posterior spinal cord fusion. The authors report that the Prodisc II device has shown significant improvement in pain and function over the course of three months. Both groups return to work within 16 days of their surgery. This study reports on the success of prodisc replacement in patients who have degenerative disc diseases. It shows that there is no significant difference in patient satisfaction at the end of the trial. Two studies suggest that smoking does equally well when ProDiscAdr is used in treating discogenic lowback pain. These studies show that smokers perform better than nonsmokkers when prostheses were used for degenitating disc disease. They also describe the use of cages as an alternative to total disc replacement because they do not involve any external fixation."

IMPLIATIONS For Nurses Purpose /OBJECTive To examine the effect of an extensive rehabilitation program on improving physical and psychological adaptation of women who are receiving breast cancer treatment. This study is a multi-institutional pilot study designed to explore the benefits of moderate walking exercise on fatigue, physical functioning, emotional distress, quality of life, as well as weight gain in patients with metastatic chest disease. The results suggest that exercise can be beneficial for these patients. Sixteen breast patients were treated with adjuvant therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation treatment; all subjects were assigned to exercise groups. In this study, no significant differences were found between the exercises and control groups except for changes in concentrations of natural killer cell subsets. Mazindola was used as an anti-cancer drug in several patients but did not improve their symptoms. Post-treatment exercise training was shown to improve functional capacity in post-chemotherapy patients by increasing their resistance."
30135903,"This paper focuses on the efficaciousness of patellal taping in subjects with knee pain. It is a well-respected intervention for patients with patelefemoral painful syndrome. In this paper, we identify and review 16 studies that have an average Pedro score of 4-25/10. We searched sixteen studies with an annual average score between 4.25 and 10.00. These studies included only patients who had been diagnosed with Patellofego pain syndrome or were experiencing acute knee injury. The results of these studies suggest that there is poor recovery after three or twelve months. A Dutch study comparing exercise to passive stretching was undertaken. There are no significant differences in physical examinations between the two groups. Plain radiograph showed increased pateller subluxations in soldiers with paternal pain disease. No consensus on definition, classification, assessment, diagnosis, or managementhas been reached"
24065550,"This paper presents a novel treatment for patients with breastcancer who have diseased quality of life after surgery. In this study, the patient's response to exercise is measured in terms of their physical function and quality-of-life. The results suggest that exercise may be more successful than usual care in improving health status among newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients. A mixed-effects model was used to predict the relative risk reduction between the two groups. After an initial period of follow-up, both groups showed improved performance on the short form-36 scale. Both groups also reported improvements in self-regarding emotions; food availability; and physical discomfort. These changes were not sustained past this point. Another study examined the effects of structured exercise upon body weight and general health in women with stage I and III breast malignancies. It found no significant change in waist circumfference or waist-hip ratio but only slight improvement in fitness. Two other studies investigated home-based exercises for men with early breast tumors. They found little effect on symptoms of fatigue and anxiety during the intervention period. However, they found some beneficial effects on sleep."

In this study, the percentage of patients responds to hypertension, diabetes, and other disease-specific treatment increases significantly in both the intervention group as well as the control group. A pharmacist's role in improving patient health is described. After six months of medication adherence, total cholesterol, low-disease lipoproteincholester, high-Density Lipoprocrisy levels, risk factor prediction Scores were measured. This study was designed to determine whether an integrated approach of pharmacy services can improve patient acceptance and comply with colestipoli therapy. It showed that co-management by physician and pharmacist could increase patient acceptment and compliance with the drug regimen. Furthermore, it demonstrated that pharmacist education and patient-resource management improved patient satisfaction and quality of life."
23327448,"The effects of a combination of strength training and balance training on older adults are reported. In the control group, there is no significant change in strength or function. However, in the exercise-training group only minor changes are observed. This study investigates the effect of two different exercise approaches on improving strength,mobility,and balance in elderly people. Both groups receive identical physiotherapy treatment 2 times per week in which strength exercises are excluded. For patients with an injurious fall history, neither exercise regimen improves physical function nor falls. A further study examines whether weight-bearing activities can be used to prevent falls in older men. There is little difference between the resistance training group and the rest of the population. Furthermore, it does not reduce the risk for falls among frail older women."
25345440,"In this study, we examine the effect of three specific fats on blood lipids in healthy volunteers. The subjects consume three different diets: 1) a butterfat-enriched diet with 70 %) of soyo oil; 2) an all-in-one diet consisting of either two or three dairy products; and finally 3) consuming only one type of fat. We find that the transfatty acid diet is more effective than the conventional low-fat diet for reducing lipoproteincholesterol but not for improving other risk factors. Our results suggest that consumption of high-rtfa from ruminateants may have negative effects on heart disease. However, moderate amounts of rTFFA are well below the upper limits of human consumption. A double-blinded, re-empowered crossover controlled study shows that eighteen men consumed five experimental isometries lasting four wk. Fat represented thirty % of entire energy intake in every diet, with two thirds of the body's fat in the forms of semi liquid margarine, soft margerine/9 g trans Fs/100 G fat ) shortening1, stickmargarines/ 26.1 pg TFAs per 100G fat as well as butter rich in unsaturated fat"

The results will improve the evidence base of lifestyle change for patients at higher risks of chronic disease such as obesity related cancer."" In addition, it will provide information on how to prevent or delay Type 2 diabetes in menopause. It is reported that weight loss from six months to 12 months can reduce the risk of type 2 by up to a whopping 73%. A further study has been performed on women with high body mass indexes who are not pregnant. Both groups lose weight during the first three months but their gains are correlated with increased vegetable consumption. They also report that they have greater changes in blood pressure than controls. These studies suggest that an individualised lifestyle intervention did indeed not have additional effect on improving CVDrisk factors among people with low-dental lipoproteincholestrol levels."
22411372,"In this study, we examine the effect of a high-carbogeneous diet on blood sugar levels and risk factors in subjects with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that reducing the amount of carbohydrate in the diet can be beneficial for weight loss and disease severity. We also find that the lower-fat diet is more effective than the higher-caloric diet in terms of improving both body weight and glycemia."

It is found that both methods increase response rates, but there is no significant difference in the mean scores between the two methods. The main effect of the form was found on either the Hearing H or Icap Inventory for Elderly, the International outcome inventory for hearing aids, Satisfied with Amplification In Daily Life, and the hospital anxiety and depression scale. Both methods had no interaction effect; however, people reported lower levels of social anxiety and self-esteem while they were anonymous. Although these results are not exact, it is believed that the use of this new technology may be more cost-effective than using traditional methods such as pen and paper."

30232622,"The aim of the study is to determine whether or not a single-handed application of 38 percent SDF will prevent dentinal caries in schoolchildren who are brushing fluoride with their toothbrushes. After three years, there is no significant difference in cumulative survival rates between primary morals treated accordingto the Crypty Reverend's technique and that of amalgam and glass cement restorations performed over an extended period of time. In addition, the children were divided into three different groups: 1) Aegis; 2) Fuji Triage; and 3) Heliosial. All teeth were restored with high-viscosity glass Ionomer composite sealants after 3 years. This was followed by two further studies: one on ""Art"" restorative treatments for class I lesions using bilayer technology and another on multiple-surface fillings using ART. Both methods showed good results in terms of patient survival. One group used conventional cavity preparation techniques while the other used arthroscopic restourative treatment. These procedures were more cost effective than conventional restreative approaches because they did not involve mechanical intervention. However, both groups had significantly higher failure rates than the others. Finally, this paper compares the survival of Art and Conventional Restoriative Methods in permanent teeth. It shows that the use of rubber dam does not affect the success rate but rather reduces it."

It uses the results of two large, well-recognized studies to advance our understanding of the molecular basis of these diseases. In this paper, we examine the association between weight loss and metabolic syndrome in women who are overweight or obese. We find that both diets lead to improved blood pressure and reduced body weight in men with the same risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes."
27198046,"In this paper, we describe the results of a doubleblind, randomed, placebo-control study in which infants were given either zinc or placebo for six months. The results showed that children who received zinc had greater gains in height, sitting height and knee height than those who didn't receive it. We also examined the effect of adding zinc on body composition and growth in pre-eclamptal children from low socialeconomic conditions. Children with zinc deficency gained more weight than their peers after 12 mo of zinc intervention. This was due to the increased rate of new cell synthesis. However, there was no significant difference in the amount of gain achieved by these children over the twelve mo observation period. A negative relationship between the rate at which weight gain and plasma zinc concentration was observed was not found. There was an increase in Musculoskeletal Aggressiveness among Pre-Embarkant children aged 27-50 mo from poor socioeconomic status. To determine how zinc may be involved in failure to thrive during undernourished young children, studies were conducted in two-blinded groups: one group gave three mg/d as part of its diet; the other group provided only 6 mo per day. After eighty-five babies were assigned to receive three millimols each daily. No differences in growth, morbidities, or motor development were found in any of the treatment groups. For example, changes in leptenin concentrations did not affect growth but rather improved energy expenditure. As previously reported, breastfed girls in Ethiopia have lower BW, BMI, FM, T, and LDL C. They also show signs of improvement in blood glutinin levels. These findings suggest that inadequate zinc consumption might lead to higher body fat and central obesity. Furthermore, some Indian men could benefit from increased intake of Zn, magnesium, vitamin C, iron, trace elements, etc."
17054174,"In this paper, Lithium is shown to be more effective than imipramine when compared to placebo in reducing the frequency of manic or depressed relapse. The authors conclude that it is necessary to identify mixed mania as a group of patients with severe depression who should be treated with prophylactic therapy. A double blinded, parallel-governing study compares the efficaciousness of lithium Carbonate and imipromine in treating unipolar bipolar disease. Although there are differences in the severity of the patient's condition, the results suggest that both treatments are highly effective."
27913280,"In this study, we examine the effects of a single daily dose on patients who have been addicted to heroin for at least 10 years. We find that methadone induces episodic memory loss in patients with recurrent heroin use. This is especially important because it has been reported that smoking and other opiate drugs interfere with decision-making. The results of this trial suggest that chronic drug abusers are more likely to be depressed than controls or heroin-using subjects. Furthermore, these patients' performance on the risk-taking task is poorly compared to those of control subjects; however, there is some evidence that reinforcement values may be effective in relieving pain. These studies also show that long-term heroin treatment does not improve driving aptitude."
26923506,"In this study, we examine the effect of a low-cal diet on bone mineral concentrations in overweight women. The results suggest that weight loss is more likely with higher levels of calcium than with lower levels. We also find that high-calcicity diets are associated with increased bone turnover and reduced risk of new-onset body weight. This study was designed to determine whether excessively high dairy consumption or vitamin D could be beneficial in weight management. It was found that both groups lost significant amounts of weight during the first two weeks of the study. However, after the second week, fat loss was greater in all groups except for the control group. Furthermore, there were no significant changes in bone mass at the end of each day."
17636758,"In this first study, we report that a high-dose of human growth-horridogenes can induce rapid growth in children with short stature. The results are impressive: the mean height gain for each group is nearly twice that of the control group. After three years, the patients return to their pretreatment growth speed and have no significant improvements in growth rate. Short term treatment of GH leads to faster growth rates than daily dosing. A double-blinded, placebo-control trial determines whether or not an extended period of use of growth hormone can lead to improved height outcome. For example, after one year of treatment, taller children respond more rapidly to gh than before. This suggests that long-term growth therapy may be as effective as conventional growth medicine in treating children who have short statues."
30482202,"In this paper, we describe a prospective observational study of 137 patients with Type 1 or Type 2 who had been receiving continuous treatment for two years. The results showed that the immediate treatment of fast-acting intermittent fasting was more effective than the delayed treatment group in improving glycanemic control. This approach could lead to improved long-term follow-up care."

Meditates are performed over 9 years in a paediatric obsession disorder practice at Maudsley hospital, London. Intent to treat sample included 50 subjects, mean age14.0,SD = 2.7, and 48 p.n. 24 males; these large within- group effect sizes suggestthat continued CBT for children and teenagers that do not respond to initial course were beneficial. Rigorous design ev trials have demonstrated efficacy but not in adults with Major depressive disorder/obsessionsive-compulsives disorder but never in patients under 18 years old. A pilot study compares behavior therapy and drug treatment in young children who had not yet responded to either treatment. Results showed significant improvement in both conditions. Both groups improved significantly on the Children's Yale Brown Obsessively Compulsed Scale after twelve weeks of treatment."" Behavior therapy produced better therapeutic changes than medication alone group. Concurrently, sertraline was more effective and generally good tolerated in treating childhood and adult Ocd. Adverse event reports were mild to moderate. Trials were conducted among patients aged 7-18 years with Oclesiastical compulsory disorder or partial response to any type of medicine."
30794924,"In this study, we investigate the effect of a probiotic-rich diet on blood glucose, lipid profiles, inflammation, and other complications in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The results show that consumption of these beneficial foods can improve blood sugar levels in type 2 patients. This is important because it may lead to better long-term management of their disease."
28284517,"A prospective, i.e. single-blind, random-experimentation study is performed to compare the safety and efficacy of three-day ampicillin-sulbactum to that of an extended-acting regimen of Errapenem in children with localized acute appendicetis. The patients were randozed either to treatment or to surgery. After one year's follow-up, only 24 patients had resolved their pain with conventional surgical intervention. In this study, we examine the effect of on-patient age, gender, mean hospital stays, modified Alevarado score, morbidness, mortality, and costeffectiveness for the treatment of acutely nonperforate appenicitus. Our results suggest that both groups are appropriate for treating acuteappendiciitis: group 1 has a higher risk of death than group 2; group 2, however, has better risk at 30 days. If resistance continues to grow, high social and economic costs will be expected"
18851916,"In this study, we examine the efficacy and safety of a home-based supervised exercise program versus an outpatient regimen for patients who have had arthroscectomy. We conclude that it is not beneficial to patients in early post-meniscsection because there is no significant difference in the time to return back to work or pay as if they were treated with physical therapy. A controlled trial compares the results of two groups: one group receives ""outpatient"" physiotherapy before surgery and the other does not. Cost savings are significant; 15 patients receive ""home-base rehabilitation"" and 22 receive regular physical treatment. Forty-five patients have primary total knee arthroplasties and are assigned to either ""clinic-rehabilitation provided by Outpatient Physical therapists"" or ""no-treatment"" exercises. Both programs emphasize routinely occurring exercises at home. Before surgery, all patients report good satisfaction with their knee function. At 2 weeks after surgery only 13% of the patients lose their strength in both groups. The mean percent loss of torque between the affected limbs is 22.1 p.m. when compared to the control group which has no specific Physiotherapy treatment but is given instructions on postsurgical management"
22006870,"The aims of this study are to develop initial criteria for in active disease and to determine what such conditions should predict in relation to probability of disease return. In addition, the results from several different question elicitation methods were used to validate the validity of flare definitions for children with juvenile Idiopathicarthrita. A pilot study was conducted to compare the health-regarding quality of life of children who had Juvenile arthritis over a 12 month period. Children reported that their pain intensity and use of painful coping strategies were better than those reported by parents. This study also examined the relative importance of physical activity and pain severity in patients withJIA. Although there is no gold standard for adult disease, we conclude that the proposed standards have sufficient construct validity to be accepted in practice."
30888337,"This paper focuses on the effects of short naps on sleepiness in patients with chronic sleep restriction. It shows that there is a significant relationship between daytime nap length and nighttime sleeplessness, but it does not extend into evening. The study also finds no association between morning nap duration and injury incidence among elite Australian college students."
32372265,"A majority of females with polycrystic oathy syndrome, or PCOS, have metabolic abnormalties that result in increased risk of development of type 2 diabetes. This study aims to investigate whether changes in gut microbial composition are associated with specific clinical characteristics in women with and without PCO. The results suggest that probiotic and psyllonic supplementation may be effective in reducing the severity of symptoms in patients with this disease."
24484314,"The FICSit Common Data Base is a collection of measures that all sites use to assess the relative efficacy and safety of various intervention strategies in older adults. All sites share certain descriptions of risk-adecisions, outcome measures, and cost-efficacy measures. In this article, we describe eight different fall-preventive measures used by eight participating sites. These include: 1) A convenience sample; 2) Functional Reach test; 3) Timed up and Go test -- one leg stance test) -- One Leg Abbreviation test for balance subsection of performance oriented mobility assessment BPOMA; AND 4) balance subsection of the Performance Obedient Mobility Assessment B-POMAR. This study was designed to determine whether falls could be prevented among older people with relatively short stays of stay. It was found that walking time was associated with falls as well as gait changes. However, there were no significant differences in walk time between walking groups. Fallers had significantly poorer scores in the Olst, TWTT, Cw, MWS, or TUG than those not falling."
26062039,"In this pilot study, we examine the association between air pollution and asthma in children. Children who spend more time outdoors are less likely to develop asthma than children who do not spend as much time indoors. This is due to the fact that children with higher physical activity tend to be younger and have a lower body mass-index. We conclude that an outdoor exercise program can be used to improve health of children aged 6 to 12 years."
27419040,"The first study focuses on boys who become overweight in the early years. Although there is little evidence for an association between weight gain and school performance, it does show that boys with higher body weights have more absences at school comparing to those who remain under normal weight. In contrast, black children are less likely to be absent from school than their white counterparts. A second study examines the relationship between changes in childhood eat habits and later academic performance. This study uses a mixed-effects model to examine the association of changes over time. For example, girls who became overweight during the beginning of school were found to have lower scores on the math test than those never obese. However, they also showed greater absence after school when they engaged in physical activity."
19461035,"After a four-week training period, the structured STT group scores significantly higher than either of the two groups for over ground walking speed and cadence. The results are largely maintained three months after the Cessation oftraining. This study examines the psychometric property of three clinical balance measures: the Berg balance scale,the balance subscale of ""the Fugl Meyer test"" and the Postur assessment scale for stroke patients with an extensive range of neurological or functional impairment from acute stage upto 180 days after first onset. Results show significant improvements in all three measures except for the Pass, who shows slightly better psychological characteristics than other measures. A prospective cohort study is designed to evaluate the effect on gait velocity in post-stroke patients. In this study, subjects with mildly depressed symptoms improve their performance by improving their balance and speed. They also demonstrate improved health at resting and during exercise. These studies aim to provide evidence that physical activity can be used to reduce the risk of stroke."
25098595,"In this paper, we describe a pilot study of an exercise intervention for overweight or obese patients with serious mental illnesses. The results indicate that the intervention is safe and can be used to treat patients who are at high risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes. We conclude that it is possible and safe to use small- group exercise for people with severe mental illness."
27804961,"The results of this study indicate that laparoscopic adjustment for gastric restriction leads to a significant reduction in health-regarding quality of life. In addition, the improvement in physical and mental health is associated with improved health related qualityof life at 12 months after surgery. A further study investigates whether changes in weight loss are more closely tied to changes within healthrelated quality or change in self-perception. This study concludes that there is no association between changing body weight and improving health status."
15627851,"In this paper, we describe the effect of a single placebo-controlled treatment on patients with acute mania. The results suggest that olandapine is superior to placebo in terms of improving symptoms of acute manic disorder."
26377094,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective study on children with malaria in the Solomon Islands. We conclude that there is no association between malnutrittion and malaria but that it is more likely to be associated with anemia than with weight gain. The crude incidence ratios for malaria were 1.17 for adults and 0.91 for children undernourished during the 6-month period before assessment. A Poisson regression was used to investigate the relation between Malnutrition-and malariaism is controversial. However, studies have found no relationship between malaria and malNecessary status. This study uses ten cohort studies to assess the relative risk of dying from low height-For-age or high weight-for Age z scores. Prevalency of each weight category was obtained from national nutrition surveys. Measurements were examined by anthropometer, laboratory parameters, and self-assessment of appetite. To examine the relations of CCK-8 serotate, phosphorus factor alpha, TNF-alpha and solubleTNF receptors to the anoexia and waste associated With HIV infection. Our results suggest that iron may contribute to disease by producing sensitivity to appetite; however, our previous studies had not been able to detect any link between these two diseases. Furthermore, they did not find any difference in growth among patients with severe malaria. These results are inconsistent because their confounding factors do not seem to account for the severity of the disease."
26590137,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the efficacy and safety of instillations for patients with interstitial cystitis. In both groups, there is a significant increase in pain and urgency after 12 hours of treatment; however, no significant difference is seen in quality of life or response to treatment. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether overactive bladder can be improved by using hyalluronic acid as an alternative to conventional therapy. This study concludes that it is possible to restore the glycoscaminoglic layer of the injured bladder through use of hypaluronates."
26758593,"Sesame oil has anti-tumorous effects on blood pressure and lipids in patients with Type 2 rheumatoid disease. In addition, it can help to treat hypertension by reducing the amount of fat that is absorbed into the blood."
26269362,"This study compares a paleolithic, or ""Old Stone Age,"" diet to eat in patients with Type 2 diabetes who do not get treatment with insulin. The results suggest that the paleotic diet may be more effective in preventing type 2 disease than the conventional heart-heathy diet. In this study, we examine the effects of an alpha-lenic acid rich Mediterranean diet on blood pressure, body mass, and fat mass in postmenopause patients. After follow-up, there are 16 cardiac deaths among the control group and 5 non-fatally."
21757259,"The results of the Prostate-Cancer Prevention Trial indicate that immediate ADT plus rebuffing therapy can significantly reduce risk of death in men with locally advanced disease. In addition, it reduces the chance of dying by reducing the relative risk among men who have a higher PSA score than those without one. This trial also shows that patients with fewer PSACs receive better treatment and longer follow-up. Although there is no significant financial relationship between the study and the actual number of patients treated in the trial, we do report that the prevalence of prostrate cancer was 6.7 percent among males with an upper PSSA level of at least 0.5 nmol/ml. Men with greater PSC scores were more likely to die from the disease than their peers with lower scores. For this reason, the prophycation trial included only 1 patient with favorable disease but experienced theoretically prevented death. After 5 years of follow up, 1,751 patients had died. Only 105 patients received Adjuvant Rebuffed Therapy for localized or metastatic prostatecancer."
28007054,"In this study, we report the results of a prospective observational study in which 150 men were randomized and asked about early or late complications. The pain score for each group was 2.76 per cent for group I, 2.1% for groups II, 18.3 percent for category III, and 10.5 percent for class IV. We conclude that prophylacin is superior to norficillinaciin or chlorammonicol in terms of infection rates after transreptal biopsy. This study compares the efficaciousness of fluorioquinolinate with cephalospoin-based antipyretics on postprostatic disease. A similar effect was observed from two weeks culture data; in comparison to five of 25 patients, having positive urine cultures, as opposed to 5, of 26 patients receiving the placebo. Prophylactic administration reduces fever and urinarry tract infections following Transrectal Biopsy. Sixteen men who had previously undergone an epitome of sepisis developed infectious complications during the procedure. These complications were not reported by any of the patients but were determined by telephone interviews. They included 13 patients who required hospitalization due to their previous prostatitious condition."
24780633,"This paper focuses on the perceptions of Australian therapists regarding the importance of evidence-based practice and barriers to using evidence in practice. The results indicate that there is no one single factor to encourage the use of new evidence into daily practice; rather, there are three main factors: desire for learning, practicality, and the propenity to adopt Evidence-Backed Practice. In this paper, we examine the changes in physiotherapist's attitudes toward EBP as they move from entry-level to mid-career. Although most changes are not significant, it appears that a substantial number of recurrent declines in Relevance have occurred during the first year of the transition period. A further study was undertaken to assess the effects of an intervention with opinion leaders who disseminated new information into practice by encouraging the behavior of health care practitioners. These opinions were expressed in terms of professional satisfaction with the knowledge and applications gained from the latest developments in medicine."
25590442,"The purpose of these studies is to determine whether the minimal clinically important difference between comfortable gait speeds and improved performance in people with stroke is associated with improvement in the Modified Rankin scale. In this study, we examine the effects of a virtual-reality-based training program on walking speed and distance for patients with hemisparesi who have been treated for stroke. We conclude that those who reach community ambulations after treatment are better at improving their quality of life than they were before. A single blind, randomed control study was conducted to evaluate the effect of an eight-week course of physical therapy using the ""Nintendo Wii"" game system on balance and motion in patients suffering from stroke"
21154393,"In this study, patients with major psychiatric disorder who have failed to respond to an adequate treatment of an anti-depressant are randomized to either long-term or double- blinded treatment. The primary endpoint is the change from end prospect iv treatment to end in doubleblind treatments. A significant reduction in the mean change was seen at weeks 1 with quetigapine and 300mg/day compared to placebo; but not with Duloxetine. Remissions were significantly better than those obtained with rispurdone for patients who did not respond adequately to one of their antidepressive drugs. This study compares the efficaciousness of extended-relieve quetiopinine fumarate to that of standard aripiciprazole in patients suffering from major depressive disorders. Both regimens improve severity of symptoms as measured by Hamilton Depression Rating Scores."
28502570,"In this study, the authors compare the accuracy of patient-specified instrumentation to that of conventional instruments in a prospective knee arthrostry trial. The results indicate that there are no significant differences between the two groups in regard to the degree of outlierity in the relative positions of the individual pieces of tissue. A reduction in total surgical time is observed for patients using patient specific cutting blocks instead of traditional instruments."
22569686,"In this study, we assess the immediate relief of symptoms after a five-day course of interavesical penicillinsulphate treatment. The results show that PPS is safe and effective in treating patients who have interstitial or painful cystitis. We also examine the safety of an intrathecical form of medicine called Bacilluscalmette-guirein in women with moderately severe intertitial Cystitiis."""
28052845,"In this study, we examine the effect of a 24-month lifestyle intervention on fasting and insulin resistance, body weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure in subjects with gestationally Type 2 diabetes. The results are similar to those obtained from other control groups. Women who reach their postpartum goal lose more weight than usual care; however, they do not show significant changes in behavior or physical activity. This is due to the fact that women's pregnancies are difficult for them to adjust to as well as the difficulty of recruiting high risk individuals. We conclude that an eight-week exercise program can be used to prevent pregnancy weight loss among Indians with impaired glucose tolerated."
32271148,"Home BP is a controlled trial designed to compare the effectiveness of ""cloud-based b"" self-management with traditional care in patients who have uncontrolled essentialhypertension. The results are mixed, but there is no significant difference in mean blood pressure at six months and 12 months. A patient education program was used to improve blood control among Latinos with hypertension; however, it did not result in improvement in other measures of health such as improved medication adherence or satisfaction. In addition, the study found that pharmacists were more likely than usual to report good health during the intervention period. This paper also discusses the use of tablet-aided behavioraL for improving risk factors among older adults with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes."
26315934,"This paper focuses on the early-onset of language delays in children with attention-deficient hyperactivity disorder. It is shown that these delays are related to shared genetic influences, which may lead to later disorders."
23076956,"In this paper, we extend our previous work by comparing the effects of early intervention for children with an autism spectrum disorder to that of other treatment groups in public schools. We find that both groups show improved performance on measures of language, intelligence, and behavior after one year of treatment, but there are no significant differences in progress at follow up."
29553824,"In this study, we examine the effects of high-flavanol chocolate on blood pressure, heart rate, and lipids in healthy subjects. The effect is seen to be sustained over a four-week period even after abstinencing for 12 h. We conclude that these results suggest that consumption of low-fat dark chocolate may improve endotohelial function as well as platelet function. A cross-over trial was carried out with thirty middle aged adults who were not treated with EH. They consumed either 100g per day or 80g each day during the course of the study. After two weeks, they had no change in their bloodpressure or heartrate. Their diet consisted of fiber from coconut, flavonoids, olive oil, fruits and vegetables, but no changes in body weight or skin folds. This study also examined whether antioxidants could be beneficial in patients with hypertension. It was found that both groups showed significant improvements in fasting blood glucose and total cholesterol. However, neither group showed any improvement in other measures of health such as waist circumference or lean mass."
29453657,"In this study, Li-carnito improves blood lipid and body weight in patients with Type 2 diabetes. In addition, it reduces the risk of heart attack by reducing the amount of trigllycerides that are involved in the pathos of the disease. The results suggest that treatment with L-carntine may be more effective in preventing these complications than other treatments."
27247216,"In this first phase of a large, prospective, and long-term randomized trial, we report that gemcitabine is superior to capecitabin in localized pancreatic disease. The safety results from the European Organization for Retrospective and Therapeutic Oncology Questionnaire-core 30 international quality of life scores show significant improvement until five months after initial treatment. A second phase II trial compares gemcitebine with capescibiin in patients with newly advanced locally advanced panceratic cancer. This study concludes that both regimens are safe and efficacious in terms of overall survival."
24589525,"This paper focuses on the use of bootstrap sampling to identify older women who are at risk for early-stage mobility limitation. The results indicate that those with high levels of knee strength are more likely to be in danger of experiencing severe mobility limitations than those without. A multifactorial approach is used to assess the effects of a single-factor intervention on mobility impairment in frail elderly people. Although females survive longer with incident pain than do males, they have similar frequency of symptoms during their follow-up. In this study, we examine whether personal economic position and neighborhood characteristics are associated with sudden changes in severity of mobility disability among older adults. We conclude that poor sense of self-mastery may lead to rapid decline of physical function in older persons. Furthermore, patients with low body weight or lack of education are particularly at increased risk of developing pre-ceremonial mobility difficulties."
29059584,"Iron preparations in pregnancy are divided into three groups: ferrous fumeate, ferric sulfite, and ferrric bisglycian. Most women stop their iron preparation due to side-effect; however, the frequency of side effects is greater in the weekly regimen than in daily regimen. In this study, pregnant women were assigned either two x 60 mill iron or one tablet each week morning and evening as per their recommended tablet intake. The results support the viewthat gastrointestinal side effect tends to have a limitation influence on compliance. This study was designed to assess the efficacy of iron treatment for pregnant females with anemia who had been treated with Ferrous Sulfate. It showed that there was no difference in serum IL 6 after four and eight weeks between the two groups. Lactofferrin was even more effective than other iron treatments in terms of improving blood concentration and decreasing the severity of adverse events. A total population of five hundred pregnant patients were recruited during their early pregnancy visits at the Upth hospital from May 1st until 30th June 2009. Women with high or low compliance were asked about what influencing their adherence"
28629342,"This study focuses on the effects of an eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program on mental distress, study stress, burnout, and subjective well being. The results are similar to those reported in other studies. A total of two88 students from the university of Norway and Tromse were assigned to either intervention or control groups. They showed significant improvements in their mental health after participating in this program. In particular, they experienced improved levels of self-repressed anxiety, reduced use of escape avoidance strategies, increased sleep, general wellbeing, etc. These findings suggest that a short hypnodysis program may be useful for improving immune function."
30574441,"In this study, the authors systematically examine the risk of spinal fusion wound infection in 987 spine patients. They conclude that there are multiple risk factors associated to such an infection, including trauma, smoking, and long-term hospital stay. The results suggest that current smoking or pre-smoking cessation is associated with greater risk than does other orthopedic surgery like total hip or KneAroplasty. This study furthermore determines the impact of prior smoking Cessations on 30-day Morbidity Risk Following lumbar Spinal Surgery. Acute spondia was most common with combined posterior-posturer procedures; 21.1 %) compared with Antenor-only procedures, 2.3 p..1 v. 1: combined anterior/posterior procedure. Major complications were also higher in those with PD, who had more major complications than controls. Predicators of periopera and delayed complications included American Society of Anaesthesies grade in N2-Question Odgement, odds Rat ratio 'Odds ratio -- 2.08 &#8216>2.008', as well as feigning local infection after open spinal surgery. These studies provide evidence for the importance of patient-related risks and predict future complications."
27683062,"The Stop Atrial Fibrillation trial is a prospective, open-label, random-experimenting study evaluating the safety of cryoballon ablation for patients with paroxismal atrium fibrillation. In this study, we demonstrate that cryostablation is superior to conventional methods for treatment of acute atrial fibility. We also report that CryoBalloon and RF are more effective in relieving pain and improving blood flow than either modality alone. A further study is presented to determine whether or not cryomembrane balloons can be used as an alternative to traditional antiarrhythmical therapy in patients who have recurrent episodes of heart attack."
20881326,"This paper, entitled ""Evidence-based Dentistry,"" is the fourth in a series of papers on evidence-base studies. It discusses the use of observational methods to assess the efficacy of treatment and preventive measures. The strongest trial for this study was the randomatic controlled trial. After polishing an initial margin around the restored tooth, it was dearcected and initially dentin surfaces were demarcated by 1mm wide margin. Knoop values were obtained for each restourative material at different concentrations of fluorine. These values ranged from 40.0 mmol/hn1 to 42.75 gm/min. In addition, the results suggest that F may inhibit caries development with either restorative materials or without them. A double blinded cross-experiment was performed to evaluate the effect of two sources of Fluoride: restreative systems and Dentifrice; inhibiting artificial root cariosis. Both treatments showed significant reductions in fatality rates among the control and anticoagulated groups. All patients should receive anticipation during hospitalization because the majority of all other trials have recommended it. Anticoagulation has also been reported in several recent studies as well. Caries lesions are less adjacent to restorations filled with Gic fillings than those treated with non-Furoricidal resin composites."
26951286,"In this paper, the authors present three examples of controversial studies involving the use of vitamin D in medicine. The first is a meta-analysis on the effect of daily doses of 500 IU of Vitamin D on patients suffering from severe postmenstrual disease. A second study compares the effects of two different forms of treatment: dyrogesteron and calcium plusvitamin D. Both groups showed significant decreases in symptoms but did not improve mental health. Another study investigates whether or not high levels of 25-OHD are associated with increased risk of falls. This study uses hazard proportional hazards to predict the relative risk for each event. It was found that higher levels were associated more with an increase in severity of illness than lower levels."
22895977,"The workers are divided into two groups: the ""control"" group, which has no breaks; and the other group consisting of a mixture of conventional breaks and supplemental breaks. Workers spend four weeks with regular breaks in order to reduce pain and fatigue during work sessions. They also undergo muscle fatigue tests at first and then again after one workday each week. In this study, Hamilton's intervention is shown to be cost-effective as it does not result in any changes in worker health or performance. However, when compared to the control group that receives only standard breaks, they show signs of improvement in pain, fatigue, and productivity. A second trial is conducted on older workers who have more repetitive wrist postures and less decision power. This results in an increased risk of elbow tendon injury among older age workers. An eight-month follow-up trial was carried out for patients with upper arm pain severity. Both groups report reduced symptoms over the course of the trial. Two hundred employees from different occupations attend the same training program. Although there are differences in average measures between the two treatment groups, both groups develop lower back, neck, shoulder, arms, headaches, etc."
23388159,"Iron fortifications are used in this study to reduce the frequency of iron deficient anemia among low-society children in Southern Brazil. The results indicate that a pre-mixed solution with iron and vitamins A is more effective at preventing these conditions than if it were only based on food. In addition, there is evidence that parasites may also be involved in the pathophysiological effects of poor iron status. This study concludes by examining the effect of two different types of feeding intervention: 1) iron-rich biscuits; and 2) ""fortified"" foods. Both groups show significant reductions in blood lead levels after 12 weeks of treatment. However, they do not show any change in other important nutrients such as B12 or zinc."
30060614,"The association between sacrificial sweeteners and Type 2D was investigated in this study. Consumption is also associated with an elevated risk of Type 2, especially for women who consume more than 100 mL per day. In addition, the consumption of artificial sweetened beverages has been reported to increase the risk by as much as twofold. A recent study suggests that drinking sugar-sweetized soft drinks may lead to weight gain in African American females. This study uses a mixed-race design to examine the effects of alcohol on body weight change among healthy subjects. Fifteen patients showed significant changes in their blood concentrations after three days of either fructosal or glucose treatment. They also showed increased levels of leptose in both groups."
28983663,"In this study, we examine the impact of an exercise program in daily practice on patients suffering from ankyloping s Pondylitis. At six months, the adjusted means difference between control groups for Bassia was 0.3, 92 % confidence intervality and for Basfii p / 0.005. The improvement in all measures of the Balneometric Score - pain score, functional capacity, disease activity, quality of living, and knowledge of disease--was significant. This study is designed to compare the benefits of swimming, walking, or exercise on jointmobility, function, pain, depression, physical function as well as bath symptoms in patients who have anaklosing spasms. Both groups show significant improvements in their scores at three months. These results are followed by further studies that assess the effects with McKenzie's exercises on pain; spine mobility, injury activity and function; and chest expansion. A multimodal exercise regimen including aerobic, stretching, breathing exercises provided in addition to routine medical treatment yields greater improvements over the 1-month period."
29954184,"The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of an advanced telemedicine intervention with standard care in patients with heart failing. In contrast, the control group was more often in New York City functional class III-IV and had peripheral eemia and renal dysfunction than those in the omium group. This study also focuses on a comparative efficacy study that evaluates the effect of pre-dissecation education about heart fail and post-dispair telephone nurse coaching coupled with home titrated of weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and symptoms for reducing all cause 180-day readmissions from older adults hospitalised with chest failure. There were five serious adverse events among the two groups; however, they did not reveal any significant differences in either group's final daily dose or duration of visits. Telemonitory could help implementand maintain effective therapy, detect worsenment heart failure, its cause promptlyto prevent medical criseses. These preliminary results suggest that telmonitoring can reduce morbidness in subjects with New Hampshire class II andIII chronic heartfaiure. All-caluse hospitalization lengthens by 63 days after follow-up at the health center. A further study will determine whether hypnosis can improve heart Failure outcome. It has been reported that there are small studies suggesting that it may improve Heart failure outcomes but its effect does not in large trials. Small studies suggestthat phoning might improve hearts failure endpoints, but their effect in larger trials has not yet been established. Brain Snack: ""The European Society of Chest Failure Association / Heart Failure Mathters.org"" provides information on how people with severe heart problems respond to self-care."
26091856,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective, long-term study of patients who have had an acute myocardial fist injury. The outcome of this study is that there is no significant risk of perforation in the cured group compared to those who receive conventional ablation."
21817143,"In this study, the effects of amlofdipine and a calcium-channel blocker on blood pressure are examined in patients with hypertonic disease. The effect of these two agents is similar to that of betaxolal or valartan. Both drugs improve BP control but have no significant differences from baseline in their efficacy. A single dose of peridopril reduces bloodpressure by 24 h. This study also compares the antihypersive effects between telmiartans 80 mg and vasaran 160mg as well as those of an angiotesin converting inhibitor. It was found that both regimens reduced stoically and diastily blood pumps while improving kidney function."
31182084,"The aim of this study is to determine whether a patient-centered decision support system can improve the quality and cost of care for patients with high drug regimen complexity. This intervention was based on an alerting, self-effacing system that allowed physicians to track their patients' progress in real time. In addition, it improved blood pressure control by reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular disease among patients who were already taking antiplatelet medication. Furthermore, the combination of direct and electronic detailing increased the percentages of patients treated with lipid reduction drugs. However, no significant changes were observed in intermediate outcome measures. A cluster-rand-omized clinical trial was conducted over three years in which 1,600 patients received either telemedicine or usual care. Although there was no change in the mean process composite between the intervention group and the control practice, both groups showed improvement in health-related characteristics. These results are not surprising since many studies have found improvements in these processes as well. For example, one study reported that ""the Diabetes Care Protocol"" combined task delegation, physician-delivered guidance, and Feedback every 3 months."" Another study examined the effect of integrating DSS into routine medical practice systems; however, none of these systems had any significant alteration after using the same vendors' EMR. Thus, further evidence must be obtained regarding the efficacy of such systems."
22000709,"In this study, we examine the effect of a single daily dose of vitamin D in healthy young people. The results suggest that it is not necessary to increase the concentration of 25-Hhod for patients with low blood pressure. A double blinded placebo-controlled intervention was performed on 66 elderly women living independently and 73 nursing home residents over an 11 week winter period. After two years of treatment, no significant changes were seen in their serum 25OHD concentrations; however, there was no apparent change in parathormone levels or bone mineral density. This study concludes that both groups should be given adequate amounts of high-dose vitamin C as they are susceptible to hypocalcemia and hypercholecalciurial deposition. It also suggests that some studies have found that consuming too much of either group may reduce the risk of common malignancies. However, these studies do not reveal any association between calcium or vitamin E supplementation and increased risk from common diseases."
22351714,"In this study, we examine the effects of a high-fructose diet on body weight and blood lipids in healthy young men. We conclude that consumption of sugarsweetened drinks is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes among women. Consuming too much sweetened beverages may lead to greater weight gain and increase the risk for developing Type 2"
29267561,"Post-pancreaticodenectomy patients receive enteral nutrition after the operation, but there is little evidence for a good diet. A guideline from the American Society of Parenteral And Enteral Nutrition describes best practices in nutrition therapy on children who are critically ill. In this study, we assess the postoperative nutrition status of 27 patients who undergone subtotal laparoscopic open cholestectomy and compare the results of two methods: 1) preoperative feeding with carbohydrate rich drinks before surgery; and 2) early feeding with water or placebo. The results indicate that early feeding improves recovery after major abdominal surgeries. After these studies, it is recommended that all patients undergo an elective colony surgery."
27467441,"In this study, we examine the effect of a modified frontal Eeg on the response of patients with major depressive disease. The subjects respond well to the treatment and show significant improvements in their performance after two weeks of treatment. A new stabilization is established in the neural circuits due to repeated training. This results in improved cortical function during the task. Furthermore, the Mph group shows better performance than the control group when comparing practice blocks. These results suggest that alpha power may be an important predictor of patient response to antipsychotic drugs. We investigate the effects of different types of psychotropic drugs on specific EEG features. For example, lamotridol increases the duration of all class classes, increased altitude 1 and beta1 power, and tends to shift the Beta1 centroid posterior. Other studies have found that some chemicals have Elimb effects opposite to those of the mental illnesses treated with these medicines. Some drugs have epilepsy-specific Eeptomes but do not cause changes in brain functions."
25359643,"In this study, the effects of two chemicals on blood pressure in patients with healthy gingival tissue were investigated. Thirt thirty volunteer dental students and rand and Omly divided up into two groups. The results showed that there was no change in blood flow or systemic bleeding in the subjects in both groups except for one agent group which did not show any significant change. This study also examined the effect of ankaferd blood stopper on the bond strength between two different types of adhesives. Both agents had significantly different shear bonding strengths. Adhesions were etched using Tetric NBond, Adhease, and One F. Bonding agents were applied to each tooth as well as pulpotomies; they were then etched by water spray. They were further analyzed by two-way analyzers and Duncan multiple range tests. There was little difference in herar bonds between control and bloodcontaminated groups but no significant differences between them."
11555536,"In this study, the authors conclude that routine chest exercises are not necessary for patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal surgical procedures. All patients have a reduction in their lung function after surgery and no airflow block is seen in patients who underwent coronary arteries bypass graftting. The results of pre-operative physical examination and blood gas analysis were performed at the beginning of exercise program and 24 and48 hours after the begin of the program; after this day A-a) O2-diff decreases in the cpap and PEP group as compared to control group, two days later, and significantly reduced in both the preptometry and icmpap groups three days afterwards. Forty-3 consecutive randotomies involving elective upper abdominal surgery were included. It was concluded that the added of breathing exercises nor incentive spriotry to'regimen of early mobilation and coughing/huffing' confers no additional benefit after uncomplicated Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting'. No difference was observed between the two treatment groups in eatlectasi, spirosis, oxygen saturation, or pulmonary infection. This study determines whether an incentive system can be used to prevent post-surgical pulmonary complications following abdominal and neck surgery. For forty-three patients with chronic air flow limitation following caBG, subjects were assigned to either breath exercises or secretion remove or physical therapy together with Is. To evaluate the potential benefits of incentive siscometry, we comparing patients receiving it to another group received no specialized Post-Operative Respiratory Care. Both groups showed significant improvement in recovery of lungs during and after operation. However, there was no difference in patient performance on the second or four postoral days. Pulmonaries were defined as development of 3or more of 6new findings: cough... ph legm, DyspneA.... chest pain. Temperature greater than 38 degree C, pulse speed more than 100beats per minute."""
25105982,"In this study, the cost of a two-year surgical and conventional weight reduction program is compared. The results indicate that both procedures lead to improved health and reduced food consumption. Both groups have similar changes in body mass index, blood pressure, and other measures of health. A significant reduction in acute hypoproteinemia occurs after gastric surgery but does not result in improvement in long-term morbidity. Two years later, an additional trial is performed on patients with severe obesity who do not undergo either procedure. This study compares the effects of bariatic surgery or laparoscopic fixed gasbic plication on weight loss as well as improvements in physical and mental health at follow-up. Although there are differences in severity of complications, no significant difference exists in overall quality of life."
28829161,"In this paper, we examine the effects of maternal feeding on infants with very low birth-weight. We find that breast milk is more cost effective than donor milk in reducing risk of necrotizing complications and improving survival for extremely premature newborns. This study uses a multiple regression model to predict the effect of mother's milk on neurodecacity at 24 months after birth. The results suggest that mothers' milk may be less likely to cause late-onset enterocoisis and lead to shorter hospital stays."
29523009,"This is a first-in-man study to assess the association between levels of vitamin K and concentrations of other cytokinses. The results suggest that people with higher tonail selenium levels are at least as likely to develop type 2 diabetes as those with lower toenails do. In this study, we examine the relationship between Selenius levels and Type 2 risk in two different age groups. We conclude that Selanium may lower the risk of Type 2, but very few trials have examined its effect on blood marrow function."
22439920,"The results of this study suggest that a combination of nurse-based care and physician-led care may improve the control of blood pressure and glucose in patients with poor control. Although these two groups have modest declines over time, they do not achieve significant improvements in intermediate outcomes. A large number of patient records were evaluated at both intervention and comparison sites for the year prior to both the Year 1 and Year 2 ADAP assessment. In addition, there was no significant change from the controls or improvement in process-and-intermediate outcomes; only minor changes were noted among intermediate outcome measures. This paper describes an attempt to improve self-care in older African Americans with Type 2 diabetes. Poor adjustment can result from uncertainty stemming out of lack of knowledge about self management activities, comoresbid conditions, and unable to resources. Patient education is one cornerstone of treating type 2 disease but there is little unanimity as to how should it be delivered. Physician learning methods are used to reduce safety and qualityof diabetes care delivery by primary care doctors. Case management resulted in great weight loss, reduced waistcircference, improved HbA1,1c level, less use Of prescription medications,P =.001. Concluusions Moderate- Cost dietitian led lifestyle case management might improve diverse health indications among obese patients With type2 diabetes, but neither group has significant decline in mean hagin A1 C levels. Two physician learning approaches are employed: 1) physicians work with their patients and theirprimary care providers; 2) cases are hard copy copies of information that provide patient-specific instructions for management at each time of every patient's visit; and3) short intervals of casemanagement instituted before ""clinic ly identified retinopathies"" significantly diminished the risks of developing rhinotypes in those with poorly controlled types of disease. These studies demonstrate that using telemedicine does not lead to better treatment than usual care. Telemedicine also fails to increase perceived autonomy support, perception of competence, satisfaction, reduction in blood flow, LDL cholesterol, etc. Furthermore, although pharmacists perform more effective treatments than physicians, such as prescribing drugs directly to patients without direct patient letters, most patients fall prey to them."
17329131,"A supervised walking program improves walking ability for patients with intermittent knee claudication. In this study, the effect of strength training on walking performance is examined in patients who have moderate to severe intermittent leg pain. The results suggest that exercise training may be an effective treatment for these patients. After six-months of vigorous exercise and motivational classes, patients show significant improvement in their symptoms, quality of living, and walking distance. Both groups are well matched. For both group, improvements in walking abilities are seen. Short-term follow-up studies indicate that there is no difference in functional status between the two groups. One year's outcome shows improved walking power, stopping distance, post-ischaemic bloodflow, or big toepressure. Another study suggests that physical training can be used to improve function in older patients suffering from intermittent limb  Claudication. This study uses a case-control design to assess the effects of exercise therapy on health-related qualities of life in elderly patients treated with chronic intermittent arm disease."

No adverse effects on cognitive function were detected during the initial 9 months of treating by a diuretic and an atenolal agent. Nine hundred and thirty-two patients aged between sixty and 73 years were included in another study to thehypertensionOptimal treatment study which aimed to examine the impact on well-being after lowered pressure and intensified therapy. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of active treatment for elderly patients who had moderately high blood pressure. A reduction in relative risks was seen for strokes or severe arrhythmies with an overall decline from 1.0to 0.41. The safety of both active and passive treatment was not observed; however, there were significant improvements in quality of life across the four years of follow up. This study compares the effect of ""active treatment"" against that of placebo in older adults with mildly elevated blood tension. Both regimens were well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events in the active intervention group but only slight negative effects upon mood, physical, and leisure activity. However, neither did any harm when compared to other treatments. For some measures, they were stable for both groups"
28107576,"A randomized, doubleblind, and prospective study of 50 female volunteers in six months shows that topical lidocain creams provide adequate pain relief for the majority of patients. In this study, we divided each arm in half to collect data on Purpura, pain, clearance, patient satisfaction on analog scales from 0 ""no"" to 3 ""high"". The results show that cold air cooling is more effective at controlling pain than cooling to 15 degrees C. This study also compares cryogen spurtening durations between two protective thresholds. Pain scores are significantly lower with an anestetic peel preparation compared with Emla cream. There is no significant difference in pain scores between the two treatment groups."
22786504,"In a large, well-controlled population of patients suffering from depression, alprasolam is the most effective treatment for relieving depressed symptoms. The only side effects are mild and minor. Both active drugs are more effective in treating depression than placebo. A double blinded, parallel-random study compares the efficaciousness of both antipsychotics in patients with major depression. Alprazam was aseffective as imipramin in relievering depressive symptoms, significantly better in alleviating somatic symptoms and showed an early onset of activities in some measurements. This paper reports that there was no effect on panic outcome in 126 patients who met DSM-IV-R requirements for Panic disorder. However, neither group experienced any significant change in response to treatment. Two hundred eight patients were assigned to either drug groups. They were divided into two groups: one group treated with four - 9mg of soliloquy; the other group received 100 -25ml of amitramin. These negative results should be understood with caution because of the severe selection criteria. Although they were not extended to all forms of depressant disorders, it was found that these patients had greater dropout rates than those receiving dothieppin."
27580753,"A cross-over analysis of a large number of studies suggests that the effects of different colored filters are likely attributedal and motivated in nature. The majority of these studies do not report positive results after three years. In addition, many studies have reported negative results for cardiovascular risk or death. However, there has been no increase in the proportions of trials that compare treatment to placebo over active comparator. This paper discusses the relationship between color and reading speed. Some people read faster when they wear colored glasses; others only when their eyes are covered with coloured sheets. Children with reading difficulties often use colored lenses as an aid. These include children with ""scotopic"" sensitivity,"" those with severe reading delays, and those who have difficulty reading because of poor print clarity. There is some evidence that using colored spectacles can improve reading performance. For example, one study found that patients with blindness who were wearing colored covers improved their reading ability by nearly twofold. Another study examined the effect of colored filtering on visual stress in primary school students. It was concluded that both types of intervention could be used to treat pain caused by visual stresses."

The results indicate that it is advantageous to use longer, more rapid-evaporating times in order to achieve greater bond strength and stability. In addition, this method improves the absorption of the two-step clearfil S3 bonding systems by using an extra layer of hydrophobic material."
31619239,"The main objective of this prospect is a ivy cohort study to describe the prevalence of Lameness at dry off in large, high producing dairy farms in New York State. Lactation groups, previous ChDL, mature equivalent Me305 milk yield, season, body condition score, and sire strength were all significant associated with lames at the dry-off. A model was developed to predict the likelihood of stumbling claw horn lesions in the subsequent milking using cow level variable collected at drying out and / or available from farmmanagement software. This paper discusses the development and test of an LCP for hisifers on Dairy Farms. The least severe proxies are those associated by failures of managing, especially Poor Claw condition and inadequate Foot care. Intervention was usually ineffective, primarily due to failure to implement it. In addition, there are flaws in design, conduct, analysis, reporting of trials that can cause the effects of intervention to be overestived or underestimated.

23359235,"In this study, we examine the effect of ranitine on infants whose weight is very low. It is found that the risk of infection and necrotizing Enterocolitis is higher in patients treated with it than in controls. The main medical and demographic characteristics do not differ between these two groups. However, there are some differences in the severity of the disease. For example, after treatment with either pantorazole- or runitidine-patients, gastric mucous lesions are more common. A double blinded trial was conducted to determine whether omeprasole can be used as a preventative measure against stress-induced Gastric Lesions in newborns. This study also focuses on the effects of proton Pump Inhibitors on bowel habit."

They conclude that escilopram is more effective than venlafine xr in terms of improving remission rates. However, they do note that some patients may experience delayed recovery after switching from one antidepressante to another. The authors use LOCF-based approaches to analyze missing patient data in studies. For example, when compared to standard treatment methods, clofetine seems to be superior to mercaptinisone for treating depressed subjects."
21143921,"In this study, we examine the effect of a visual-gait training program on balance function in older women. The results suggest that it may be more efficient to use biofeedback than physical exercise for improving balance functions after stroke. ABF improves stance stability by increasing the amounts of postural corrections + / 1 degrees threshold. Twenty-one elderly patients are included in the trial. After two weeks of intense balance training, subjects who receive visual feedback improved their gait and were better able to avoid falling. This study is an attempt to develop 'a checklist' of quality assessment tools used for assessing the method logical quality of studies. It was found that both groups showed similar changes in terms of clinical characteristics. Both groups also showed significant improvements in performance of daily living activities. Two exercises approaches could reduce the frequency of falls among frail old women: TT and computerized balanced training. These studies aim to evaluate the efficacy of these two approaches on specific primary outcomes -- biomedical, functional, and psychological social indicators of fall."
22023891,"Prognosis is a branch of medicine that involves the study of how well patients are able to recover after an acute event. In this paper, we describe the use of pre- and post-surgery measures in stroke patients to predict outcome. The results of these studies suggest that there may be some relationship between early motor scores and functional recovery later in the stroke process. A comparison of two different assessment tools, transcranial magnetostimulation and delayed time-recorded musculometry, is made. Both approaches show promising results in predicting upper limb function after stroke."
29793007,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to assessing patient satisfaction with changes in pain. They use sensitivity and exactity analysis to determine whether patients will report improved pain after four weeks of treatment. A cut-off value of 50 p.m. relative pain reduction or an absolute pain improvement is more likely to be reported on the Gpe than any other measure. The results indicate that all outcome measures are suitable for measuring changes from the patient's perspective. For example, there is evidence that back pain can be measured by the RMDQuest, Oswald Disability Questionnaire, and Neck Disability Index. However, these measures do not depend on specific type of intervention; instead, they relate to ""minimaly important change"" which is used to calculate the effect of different types of therapy. This study also uses the Patient-Reported Outcome Measures as an anchor for the calculation of the mean difference between the severity of pain and the quality of relief. It was found that the worst pain score was significantly lower than the best pain scores. Although some studies have attempted to use multiple measures to assess pain, such as the Short Form 36 physical component score, Osteoartritis Index, Back and Leg Pain Numeric Rating scales, among others, it has not been proven reliable."
20662327,"In this study, we examine the effects of six months of growth-hormone treatment on height and body composition in infants who have a Prader Willi syndrome. After two years of treatment, the children's height velocity is significantly increased in both groups. Children with PWs show signs of abnormality of body mass and fat. The rate at which bone maturation is improved is not affected by the treatment. Six peripubert boys with prder-willi Syndrome undergo long-term treatments with growth hormone for 2 years. They are divided into two groups: one group receives 15 IU per week; the other group gets 30 ug/week. This results in an improvement in height speed, weight, age velocity, and muscle mass in patients with PS. Aims: To determine whether different dosages of grow-harness therapy during pu Bertha in children with ""growth-hormone deficiencies"" can be used to treat these children. Results: Both groups showed similar height increase scores after 1 year. However, they did not differ in their leptenin or IGFI concentrations. For girls with Turner Syndrome, elevated androgen levels were associated with hormonal differences that were usually related to aging. Two years later, another Canadian long term multicentre trial was performed on the effect of human growth force on final height, sexual development, psychological status of daughters with Prder willi disease. Girls received oestogenen as controls. There was no difference in growth response between the control group and the treated group. Later, several Spanish hospitals participated in studies on how growth factor affects short preubertal children without intrauterine growing retardation. These studies included three parallel groups where each group received either recombinateant human thrhGH or dandyceride. At the beginning of the study there was chronological age 5.1 ky 0.3 years, bone age 3.2.9 k -3 years, length velocity below +1 SD. Age velocity above + 1 SD was measured using the toddler infant motor evaluation. Preparing for puberty had been considered major causes of Fat Accretion and Metabolic degradation in Prater-labhart-Wili disorder.

The results suggest that long term physical activity levels may be important for breastcause mortality. Women who are most active at the beginning of the study have a 53 percent lower mortality risk than those who were least active during the follow-up period. In addition, women who engage in more vigorous activities have an increased risk to death from all causes. This is supported by the fact that body size and other biomarkers indicate that exercise may reduce breastcarrying risk. Furthermore, this intervention has been shown to improve physical health in patients with early stage breast cancer."

After six months, 22 patients remain free of symptoms and have no AF during Holter monitoring. This is an important finding because it indicates that there is little difference in the heart rate after PVI-LALA vs. S-PV or C-Segmental ablation. A total of 11 patients with parosmal atrium fibrillation and 43 with persisting aff were assigned to undergo isolated PV isolation either alone or from large areas around their ipsilatéral lesions. They did not experience any significant differences in heartrate variability between the immediate afterpair of PhVI and those without recurrent paternal cavalry.

They use sensitivity analysis to determine whether significant change in ECG scores is associated with greater risk of heart disease and stroke than is used to classify people into different risk categories. The results suggest that exercise testing may be useful as an aid in risk assessment among symptomatic men who have no history of cardiovascular disease or stroke. This study consists of 1726 middle aged men free from coronary chest disease without taking beta blockers. It was performed in 1575 male subjects who were free at the time of the study. There were 113 deaths during follow-up; there were also 55 deaths caused by coronarry heart diseases. A recent European systematic Coronaryrisk Evaluation Score was used as hedging tool for predicting all-caus mortality among patients suffering from symptoms of acute myosmia. All cause, CVD, and death were related to each other. Most predictive ECV findings for CHD died were St segment depression, risk ratio, left ventric hyperthorne, bundle branchblocks, T waveflattening, ischaemia,and arrhythmics. After calculating the relative risks of these risk factors, it was concluded that the severity of STSegments could be considered prognosically important because they can predict future events."
23053553,"Sixteen obese patients with Type 2 diabetes were studied in an outpatient regimen. They ate a variety of different fats, including trans-fatty acid diets and monounstained fat foods. The results showed that the overall fat composition of each diet differed from those of other patients. Fat represented thirty %) of total energy consumed in every diet; with two- thirds of it was fat in the forms of semi liquid margarine or soft marrageine. Shortening had no effect upon fasting levels but did not affect LDL cholesterol. In this study, we examined the effects of transfat on the electroderonic characteristics of leptotrophic lipoprotein concentrations. We found that after consumption of butter-enriched food, Lelpid particle size increased significantly and in dose dependent fashion. This study also investigated the role of specific fatty chemicals in altering blood concentration for markers of inflammation. Consuming high-quality fat led to greater changes in both glucose and insulin secretion. Both diet periods were followed by ardized base diet until they reached their desired level of energy. After three weeks, all men consumed five experiments. Cholsterol concentrates in large proportions than does carbohydrate. A crossover experiment was performed whereby 50 men consume controlled diet at 15 g per day. Fatty acids were replaced across the diet: 1)cholesterol, 2)oleic Acid, 3)trans-Fast/STEAric acid, TFA +STE, 4 %of energy each, and 12,0 -16:0 saturated fat.

25122666,"The aim of this study is to assess the association between asymptomatic stumbling test and risk of postoperative complications in elderly patients with pulmonary resection. In this paper, we report that poorer leg strength has been associated with higher mortality in men and women suffering from pad. We also present an observational prospective study of 304 patients who received pulmonary obstructive lesions for lung disease. Our results suggest that improvement in knee flexion, hip extension, and other measures of strength may be important in predicting future events in these patients."
25957185,"In this study, we compare the efficacy of chemoradation and surgery in patients with stage IVA or IIIA non-smal cell lung cancer. We conclude that adjuvant therapy is superior to observation in terms of overall survival for patients who have completely resected their disease. The results suggest that addition of chemotherapy may reduce distant spread of disease and prolong the life of these patients. A meta-analysis was performed on the basis of an earlier meta analysis. This trial was designed to evaluate the effects of combination of conventional cynemolinary and endocrine agents on survival after completion of complete rsection of non small celllung lungcancer. After a phase I trial of either treatment followed by surgery or boost prophylectomy, the 5-year survival rate was 53.3 percent in the intervention group and 42.9 percent among the control group."
30244208,"A novel short, curved bone stem is used for total hip replacement. In this study, we examine the effect of a shorter-stem prosthesis on bone mineral density in patients with osteoarthritis. Short stems have an acceptable reduction in bone loss compared to conventional straight stem and no further changes are seen after two years. The aim of this trial is to determine whether there is any difference between cementless fabricated fetal parts and those made of polyethylene or ceramic. This study will allow us to evaluate the efficacy of new surgical methods for treating hip pain."
20467515,"The purpose of this study is to assess the reproducibility of a six-minute walk test in patients with mild heart failure. This test is used to predict whether or not they will survive three to eight months and to compare the response of these patients to that of other patients who have had similar results. In this case, the responders are older than the control group. A comparison between the six minute walk trial and the Boston Heart Failure Questionnaire indicates that the latter is more accurate than either test alone."
18254008,"In this study, we examine the effects of a daily exercise program on patients with anklelosing pondylitis. After eight weeks, the group shows significant improvements in all the measures of the Balneo-Assidic Disease Score and Functional Index. The improvement is not as significant as that seen in the control group. A further study suggests that home-based exercise might be more effective for patients suffering from ankyloping disease. This study also reports that back exercises improve pain and function but do not affect long-term changes in health. We conclude that combined spa-exertion therapy can be used to prevent for longer than one year degradation of spinal function or fitness in patients who have acute spondies."
19688227,"The authors present a new approach to restorative treatments for patients with caries. They use an omished clinical trial to compare the performance of two different approaches, one using glass iconomer and the other using amalgam fillings. Both approaches have good results in terms of patient survival. After two years, there are no significant differences between the nine treatment groups. Only three of the 72 fissured teeth adjacent to the restoreds retain any Gic material. However, two groups consisting of Fuji IX-GP and Ktac Molar Aplicap place in Class II Cavalry preparations showed significantly lower survival rates. In addition, both methods were less time-consuming than their conventional methods. At six and twelve months, all restorations had been available for assessment of marginal discolouration, surface texture, contour, post-operative sensitivity, and revoked Caries that remain at 100 % alpha-rating"
22943325,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach for evaluating the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic colangiograms in patients with choleclasis. They describe an attempt to assess the value of routine Introoperativecholangography in determining the risk of injury by using pre-operative indications. The results indicate that open surgery is safe and can be performed with near-zero mortality. This paper also discusses the use of pooling or combination of studies to determine whether specific peroperatory procedures result in more morbidities or mortality than open surgical procedures."
30180088,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective observational study on 60 children who have acute pain. The mean scores on the Faces and Color An Analogue Pain Scale are compared with those of the Children's Hospital Of Eastern Ontario Pain Score. We conclude that the scales can be used to assess pain in children without training. A total of 30 children with pain were enrolled; 30 with painfulness and 30 without. After analgesick administration, the median score decreases to 3.1cm/IQR: 1.1-4.3 and 2.0 faces. Metaphorically, all measures seem to tapping into distinct aspects ofthe pain experience. This prospect i has study is conducted of all patients who presentation to an urban emergency department between 5 and16 years of ageinclusive after written consent was obtained. All measures seemed to tap intodistinguished yet overlapping aspect of their pain experiences. Critterion validity regarding acutepain was assessed byresponsiveness to ""a sterilized painful stimulus"" in order to demonstrate concurrent andconvergent validated validity. Conveniently, heart rate does not respond to response to any kind of treatment. Furthermore, there seems to be some relationship between pain scores and others self-representation, clinically meaningful outcomes, including perceived needs for medicine, pain relief, and perceived satisfiedness with treatment in child postoperatively. Posterificial wounds do not differ in pain severity among different age groups. Morton compares the Simple Pain Measure with three alternative measure of pain intensity -- the Facial Pain Rating scale, which uses facial expressions as identifiers of distress, or the Smile Pain Survey, using smiley faces as anchors for no pain but pain negative emotions. There is little difference in the VAS when comparing it to the FPS-Revisised and the Color Analog Painscale, both of which show strong psychometric characteristics in young children."
20386243,"Heart failure patients receive a better quality of life after six months than before. A nurse-led approach to heart failure reduces the number of readmissions, hospital days, and costs in the intervention arm. The cost per year is reduced by an additional 6 months. In addition, there are no significant differences between the two groups on measures of health-related status, qualityof life, or psychological changes over time. This study compares patient education with home-based care for patients with acute myomyocardial arteriosis. It was found that smoking cessations were more effective than general practice care in improving blood lipid levels in patients who had been treated for coronary disease."
31679041,"In this study, Wu et al. compared the effects of two different forms of melonin on blood concentrations in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 hepatomas. The first group received 10mg / day while the second group was given only 3 times a week. After four weeks, the mean levels of ICAM-VCAM, C-Reactive Protein, and Nitric oxide were significantly reduced in the MelatonIN group. This is an important finding because it has been suggested that the use of MLT may be beneficial in treating advanced disease. However, other studies have shown that MTT may not be as effective as expected."
32127750,"In this paper, the authors describe a double blind placebo-controlled trial of cannanods in patients with mild to moderate multiple sclerical disease. The results suggest that they may be effective for some symptoms and are well tolerated. This study is an important advance in the field of medicinal extracts because it has been used as an adjuvant to other treatments such as morphine and gabapanentin. It was found that there were no significant side effects on pain or quality of life during the first two weeks of treatment. However, after the initial four weeks, many patients experienced adverse events. A further study was performed by Jaffrey Holmwood regarding the use of CBME in treating multiple Sclerosis. He concludes that its efficacy is modest but ""clinically relevant"" in terms of improving pain and sleep."
24045741,"The aim of this study is to assess the risk of early mobility disability in older women. A tool was developed that could be used to aid physicians and research men in deciding who women should target for preventative intervention. It was validated by bootstrap sampling and estimated at 73 %), with an outcome measure being incident mobility difficulty within 18 months. The outcome measures were incidentmobility disability within 24 months, meaning that self-re reported difficulty walking 0.7 km / climbing 10 steps or transferring into acar or bus. This paper uses standardized methods to predict whether exercise can improve physical function in elderly people at risk for early movement disability. In general, both exercises are effective in improving health status among older adults with moderate to serious disease. Although there is no specific cause for these limitations, patients with mild to moderate disease tend to report higher levels of physical performance than those with no limited limitation. These results suggest that such activities may provide significant benefits to older adult patients. Physicians frequently diagnose diseases as well as other conditions. Physical musculosities are more commonly associated with lower body strength than with any other condition. Older American Indians with Type I or Type II diabetes mellitsus are at greater risk because they have less muscle mass. They also have increased risk from loss of 10 percent body weight. Both studies show improved functional performance in both groups but not in control groups. Two years later, compared to controls, younger age has been shown to have better leg strength. Walking time is improved in two groups; however, it is not seen in the control population. Women with high illegitimate children have fewer symptoms of illness than their peers. Men with low IL-6 scores have much higher riskof developing injury due to reduced muscle strength after adjustment for change over several weeks. Ageing women with elevated idipose have had disproportionately high risk factors for developing injuries. Younger women without high blood concentrations have worse risks of developing pain and increasing decline in physical functions. Elderly women suffering from knee stiffness have even greater odds of experiencing trouble walking. High activity is especially important since it increases the likelihood that one's legs will fall out of shape."
24139781,"This is the first large-scale, long-term observational study of a novel intervention for weight loss. It involves three different treatment groups: 1) behavior therapy; 2) food provision; and 3) reinforcement. The results suggest that these treatments can be more effective than previous approaches. In addition, they lead to improved health outcomes in overweight subjects."

18603458,"This paper focuses on the use of an E-Diary to assess pain in patients with a chronic temporo-ibular disease. The results suggest that this method may be useful for predicting changes in pain over time, but it is not as effective as other approaches. A study comparing three commonly used methods for measuring pain during trials of patients suffering from fibromyalsgia was conducted. In this study, we examined the influence of pain intensity on sleep quality and pain severity. We found no relationship between these two measures, however, and concluded that there was no direct relation between pain intensity and sleep satisfaction."
16508562,"After 21 weeks, the weight reduction group loses an average of 7 pounds. In addition, there is a significant decline in high-Density lipomeprotein and total cholesterol. The metoprololil group has reduced blood pressure by about 10 mmhg while the placebo group had only 5 mHg. This does not mean that they are more effective than either treatment. However, this study does show that long-term exercise training can improve forearm function in mildly essential hypertension.

26457234,"The combined Dak therapy for obesity has been shown to be effective in reducing body weight, improving blood pressure, and improving quality of life. In addition, the physical training improves both total body adisposity as well as visceral or total-body fat. This study is an attempt to determine whether the effects of exercise training are due to external effects or internal ones. It was found that there were no significant changes in BMI, waist circumference, body composition, or other measures of health during the intervention period. However, it was noted that the intensity of the training did not lead to any change in either body mass or body size. A further study was carried out on the effect of resistance training on heart function in overweight children. Both groups improved their fitness and strength at different intensities."
32219688,"The results of this study indicate that workplace physical exercise improves back pain and muscle strength among workers in both the workhouse and home groups. Muscleoskeletal pain is significantly reduced in either group, but there are minor changes in the control-group. Nurses attend Spine Care For Nurse's program for three months. A cluster-rand omize controlled trial investigates whether a physical activity intervention with technical measures consisting of an IMUs, sEMSG, heart ratemonism, and video recording of physical fatigue could reduce the frequency of excessive physical tasks during working days. However, the intervention lead to decrease general fatigue and increase influence on ownwork. In addition, it was found that weight, body fat, waistcircference, blood pressure, as well as improved aerobic fitness showed the great potential health promotion among these high-risk laborers."
22204444,"This study focuses on the role of social support in predicting exercise adherence for older adults. It is shown that women and men who have low levels of physical activity are at greater risk of failing to follow through with an exercise program than those who do not have adequate social supports. The main outcome of this study is to identify the most effective predictors among long-term, healthy elderly subjects. A signal detection methodology is used to detect the best combinationof predictrs of long term exercise behavior in two69 healthy sedentaries ages 50 or older. Short-lived individuals were found to be more likely to adhere to organized exercise regimens than their peers. In addition, lifestyle intervention was associated with improved physical health and quality of life. Two years later, a second trial was conducted using pedomedes to assess the effects of short-life events on exercise performance. For example, major life events had remarkably positive effects on subsequent exercise participation. However, reduced muscle strength, slow reaction times, and drug use did not lead to significant changes in exercise habits during the first year of the trial."
20439575,"The effects of growth-hormone treatment on the children of Prader-labhart-willi syndrome are described. In group 1, height and weight increased rapidly, while in group 2, underweight and preubertal were not observed. A sensitivity to fluid retention was noted in both men and women, suggesting that testosterone might augment or estradol may increase the antinarrator's actions of gh. Sixteen males were assigned either resistance training or placebo; they received 40 mg/day from two groups. Both groups trained their major muscles in an identical manner. For 12 days, both groups performed all major muscle clusters in Anabolism: strength, peak power, and IGFI increased significantly after GH. Plasma lactate and glutathionine increased more during exercise after blood recombineration than before. Eight highly trained men aged 26 yr old, 26 years old with a mean age of 3 kg, body mass 92 pmol/d, fat 10.1 %, lean body Mass 0.1 %) were included.

27724985,"In this study, we examine the effects of water-soluble fiber on total cholesterol and lipoprotein concentrations in middle-aged British adults after eight weeks of consumption of two meals containing no oatmeal bran or wheat flour. The results are similar to those seen in other studies; however, there is little time-by treatment interaction between the two diets. A low dose of beta-glican does not reduce totalcholesterol or LDL levels in volunteers with high blood pressure. However, large servings do improve these results. For example, a cereal rich in oat brn reduced total and low density lipostomy by 2.6 mmolg/L for bread and cookies, and orange juice did not change either group's total or lowdenst lipometry content. This study investigates the efficacy of drinking concentrates of ephexin from flora that have been used to treat hypercholsterolemia. It was found that concentrated alcohol had an effect on both heart disease and Type 2D patients. After three months, all groups lose weight and show lowered waist circumference."

14763717,"In this study, we examine the effects of high-intensity strength training on patients with a history of knee pain. The patients who received the training showed significant improvements in their symptoms and quality of life when compared with controls. This was followed by an extended follow-up period to determine whether the intervention had any effect on stroke patients. After two months, the patients in the control group improved significantly more than those in either the experimental group or the non-experimental group. These results suggest that resistance training may be an appropriate intervention for stroke survivors."
27941660,"In this study, we investigate the effect of glumazide-metered release on the risk of developing peripheral nervepathy in type 2 diabetes patients. We conclude that it is possible for metformin to cause such an exaggerated form of nerve dysfunction in Type 2 diabetic patients because of its high blood concentration and its potential for irrational action. The results of this trial are described in further detail. A single center, rand andomized, 52-Wk comparator controlled clinical study was performed in patients with newly diagnosed uncontrolled Type 2, diabetes mellitateus. All of the 3 drug treatments represent effective and safely first-line treatment options in those patients; all of them represent efficacious and safe first line pharmaclogical treatment option in these patients: metformedin reduces amounts of folate/vitamin B12 resulting in a slight increase in homo Cysteine. This study determines whether metforming improves blood pressure in children with Type 1D. It also establishes that met formsine may be useful as compared to insulin in improving blood flow in newly treated patients who have Type 1, especially in women with polychemia."
29146638,"In this study, we examine the effect of a 24-month lifestyle intervention on fastingblood glucose, insulin resistance, body weight, waist circumference, and body mass index in subjects with high risk for Type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that an active lifestyle change can reduce the risk of type 2 by 58 percent and metformine by 31 %). This suggests that there is some savings to be made in the form of improved health and reduced costs over time."
21914513,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights focuses on improving the quality of life in patients with first episode of schizophorenic disorder. He uses a disease specific utility-mapping function to predict how long it will take for these patients to recover their health and social functions after treatment. The results suggest that they can be expected to return significant improvements in both physical and mental health within one year's time following either intervention. Both treatments show similar changes in the short-form version of the Self-Affect Questionnaire as well as an adjusted measure of general health. This study also compares the performance of two new drugs, olazapine and haloperiddol, in terms of improvement in health-related satisfaction in subjects with schizophrenia. After 12 weeks, patients receiving rispure have improved significantly in five domains of self-awareness: bodily pain, General health, social functioning, role-earning, and psychological health; however, there is no difference in severity of symptoms between the two groups."
26075896,"In this study, we examine the effect of a single topical agent -- allantoine -- on scarring in rats. The results indicate that allantoin induces inflammatory response which leads to an increase in the healing capacity of the wound. We conclude that both Oe and Hse are more effective than either treatment in improving the symptoms of new post-surgical scars. Scar halves are divided into two portions and each half is assigned treatment with one of these agents: onion extract or Petroatum oil. After 11 months, patients receive follow-up visits. This study compares the effectiveness of silicone gel sheets and creams for improving scar formation. Both treatments have significant efficacy. For example, after median thorac surgery, skin color changes significantly when they are treated with garlic extract. However, there is no difference in severity at the endof the observation period between the three groups. A comparison of surgical wounds using imiquimod has been made; however, it does not cause serious adverse events."

The results are compared with two validated sets of standards for finding studies that use precise searches. In particular, we identify 116 studies using highly sensitive searching. We also perform a replicate trial-retestreliability study of an outcome measure, the aggregated Loomotion Function Score, which was used in arthroscopic knee surgery. It was found that the score was more responsive than walking speed, pain at walking, or physical functioning. This paper proposes standardized response measures for patients with knee OA."
27714852,"In this study, we examine the effect of physical activity on depressive symptoms among older patients with Major Depressive disorder. After 16 weeks, the group does not differ in Hamilton-D or Brain Dysis Scores. However, a combination of exercise and antidepressant treatment is more effective than either treatment alone. Children who have suspected motor problems tend to have an increased risk of physically inactivity in childhood. This association is confirmed by the fact that children with low preoccupation with physical activities are more likely to be physically active during their early adulthood. The authors conclude that there is some evidence that physical fitness and obesity may lead to higher academic achievement in later life."
21733480,"The present study demonstrates that homeopathic medicine is superior to placebo in the reduction of pain and improving quality of life for persons with a chronic fibromyalsgia. Forty- three patients completed the treatment regimen. There was no reported adverse event; however, there were significant improvements in pain scores and function after 3 months. A pilot study was designed to investigate the efficaciousness of homeopathy on treating persistent traumatic brain injuries. It was found that both groups showed significant improvement in their symptoms. In addition, they had improved performance on the Self-rating Measures for Pain and Global Impression scales."
16034880,"In this study, we examine the safety andefficacy of a combination of two antidepressant drugs, fluoxetine and desipramin, for the treatment of migraine. We conclude that both are effective in treating headaches but that their side effects are limited. A double blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the efficaciousness of either drug in patients with chronic pain-type headache was performed. Forty outpatients were included in an eight-week doubleblind trial to assess the effect of combined treatment on headache severity. The results suggest that Central serotoninerrgic nervetransmission could play 'a role in pathophysiological' of chronic tension Type headache also in undepressed patients. This study further investigates the prophyllactic effect provided by sertraline when compared to placebo in migraine Prophylus is based on 59 patients who were stratified according age, gender, severity, and frequency; each patient was treated at rand and ommization schedules as required. No effect from femoloxet was demonstrated in the headache score."
31097278,"This study focuses on the effect of nurse-led, community-based approaches on blood pressure control in patients with uncontrollable hypertension. The results suggest that this approach is more cost effective than routine care and that it improves patient adherence to prescribed drugs. A larger trial is being prepared for further evaluation. In this paper, we describe the efficacy of a Nurse-Led Cardiovascular Risk Management program among low- income patients who have elevated cardiovascular risk. It was found that the intervention group improved both sensitivity to blood flow and diatolic blood tension. At one month, the mean stystolicit blood stroke changed from 159.8 mmH G to 153.2 mHg. After six months, these changes were not significant. However, they were significant enough to indicate that there were no differences between the treatment group at baseline and afterward.

16861726,"The aim of this study is to determine the effects of vitamin E-modified dialysis on anemia, erythropanoiehin requirements, and glutathion levels in patients with chronic uremia. In these patients, both basal and sub-sequenced levels of alpha-tauphoid are maintained during the treatment period. Thirty one patients were divided into two groups: PSE group for six months, followed by Spequeno PS for another 12 months. These patients received either high doses of Vitamin C or low dose amounts of Hippolyte. This was sufficient to prevent an increase in peroxidation; however, it did not lead to any significant changes in blood cell count, RBC counts, or other endpoints. A further study was performed on thirty-one patients who had been assigned to three different groups. Each group consisted of four different treatments: 1) Huepo/Cl-E, 2) D-A-P semenoid,3) O-D-S pesine,and 4) V-O-F semesine. After 24 patients underwent each treatment, they returned to their normal levels. They also showed no signs of cardiovascular disease at all."
20226989,"Amlodipines reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. In addition, amlofdipine has a significant reduction in the severity of atheresis and reduced the rate of blood pressure variability. This is important because it can be used to predict whether or not angiotension will lead to heart attack. The AntiHypertensive/Lipid Lowering treatment to prevent heart attacks trial was first published in 1990. It showed that all classes of antihysterics were effective but that they did not improve the incidence of fatal heart disease. Adverse effects on study drugs included hypokalemia, hypomagnesses, hyperuricity,hyperlipidemia; insulin resistance, and vexed angina. Other studies had also shown that some antihypersive drugs improved survival and prevented morbidity for persons with heart failing or left ventil dysfunction treated with anithrotine-converting enzymes1. Finally, there was only one large outcome trial designed to determine which class of drug was most effective against coronary heart diseases. All these trials failed to show any benefit from either type of treatment. For example, diuretics were poorly tolerated and could not be found to have any beneficial effect on the prevention of stroke. A series of other studies examined whether certain anticontradictory drugs would increase the efficacy of their use. These studies concluded that both types of therapy were safe and generally well received. One such study reported that ""low dose felo dipine extended release"" was more effective than placebo in reducing the frequency of minor vascular events. Another study investigated whether alpha blockers or chlorthalidene should be given to elderly patients suffering from mildly to modely elevated blood tension. Both regimens are well toleratedas. Two further studies were conducted regarding the safety of newer anticonspiracy agents including doxrazin, analphablocker, as well as chlorhalidone. They demonstrated no significant difference in primary endpoint between the arms. However, within the range of disdainful blood flow, we saw no evidence of thresholds below which low levels of Db were associated with less risks"

The results indicate that menstrual changes have an effect on the performance of knee joints and nerves. Thirty two females participate in the same study as the other thirty-two women. ACL injuries occur more frequently during the prepromenital period than during their active season. This is due to the fact that women use contraceptives longer than men; therefore, contraception might reduce the risk for injury."

Both groups demonstrate significant reductions in rmsd and slower heart rate during the 6Mwt when compared with the EG, but no significant differences are observed in objectively measured changes of physical activity from 3 months before surgery to 9 months after. In addition, both groups show improvements in health-related qualities of life at all timepoints after bariatic surgery. This study is a prospective comparative study that compares the effects of weight loss and post-bariatric gastric bypass on patients' performance on gait speed, short physical performance battery, and six-minute walk distance. It was found that there were significant changes in these measures over the course of the study. For example, mean body mass index increased from 40.16 kg/m 2 preoperativelyto 33.14kg/mm1 1 year postoperablely."
30893346,"The results of this study suggest that the use of a clinically tuned, electric ankle prosthesis may be more cost effective than their conventional prostheses. In contrast, the power-tongued foot has no significant difference in energy consumption or speed when compared with the non-powered prosthesis. A crossover design was used to determine whether there were any significant differences in energetics and preferred speed between the two types of prosthetics; these differences were not statistically significant. This study also examined the effect of age and consthetic walking aids on the performance of transfimoral ampute patients. It was found that those wearing the control group had higher energy expenditures than those using the quad socket. Furthermore, it was concluded that ""the improved performance"" of the test leg could be due to the increased efficiency of an electrically controlled knee joint."

In order to compare their antihypertinesive effect, a combination consisting of resolpine 1,1mg/d, serpasil 2, Ciba, and hydrochlorostothiazde 25mmol/D was studied in this study. The combination proved to be as efficacious as that of Sotalol Plus Hychholothazide for reducing blood pressure in either the Black or the Indian patients. Two patients took the combination involving sotalolil did not develop side effects, but this does not occur in all of those taking it. This paper looks at the conformity between institute and office when compared with the two investigation units. It shows that there is need for careful documentation of every accompanying data; particularly in multi-centre studies."
26407688,"A population-based sample of 787 older men was followed for eight years and assessed on measures of good-being, depressive symptoms, control, and fall history. After adjustment by sociodemographic, psychotoxic medication, health ; and sensori motor function, we found that depressed symptoms were risk factors to subsequent falling. We conclude this the three wellbehaving measures are independently association with falling and should be considered infall-risk assessment strategies and population based preventive and intervention strategies. This study is a prospective observational cohort of 4260 elderly men from Perth, Western Australia who had been admitted to hospital during the previous year due to excessive use of one or several potentially inappropriate medicines. The results suggest that there may be an increased risk of falls among older people living at high risk because of their habit of using antidepressant and hypnototics as predictors. In addition, the area under the Receiver Operation curve was 0.79 indicating that patients do not have adequate communication about cost-related drug adherence. Preventment of Fall Network Europe has been working toward improving the burden of fallen injury in older adults through excellence in scientific research and promotion"
22044842,"In this paper, we examine the relationship between physical activity and functional performance in adult patients with knee ostearthritis. We find that increasing physical activities are associated with improved quality of life and reduced depression among treatment-patients with the disease. Furthermore, there is a strong association between exercise and other health-related factors such as OA severity, knee pain, injury, body massindex, comoresbidity, depression, smoking, and alcohol use."
25132078,"After two procedures, the overall success rate with PVI is 39 % and 75 p..1 in paroxy-smal ailment. Parosal AF continues to develop after only one ablation procedure. The results of this study suggest that long-term repeatablations are not permanent because atrial recurrances are still common after the initial year. In patients who have ""PVI plus L"" strategy,"" however, they remain free of symptoms for longer than three months. A further study investigates the use of circumferentially guided electrodes as an alternative to single-line lesions for treating persistent atrium fibrillation. This study concludes that it is possible to perform both types of isolation without significant risk of complications. Ablation using complex fractionated electricgrams has been used to treat persistent or long term atarrhythmic disease."
24715614,"In this study, we examine the effect of a daily training program on performance in elite young American soccer players. We find that every hour of training results in improved field test performance and recovery. A comparison is made between two groups of young elite baseball players who complete resistance training at different intensities. Both groups show significant increases in body mass, strength, and speed. The control group receives more training than the intervention group; however, they do not show any changes in injury severity. This study also describes the association between injury and type and volume during an eight-week endurance training regimen. It shows that both small side games and running can be equally effective for improving athletic performance. Sixteen junior rugby League players were followed through their full competitive season. Athletic performance was measured by preseason assessment, basic characteristics, health and life patterns, playing experience, injury experience as well as training patterns. Field performance tests were performed throughout the season to determine whether or not injuries occurred. These studies showed that there was no relationship between intensity, duration, or load of matches with injury. However, it was found that these factors were associated with the increase in risk of injury among professional Rugby League participants. Furthermore, fatigue and being in shape demonstrated the largest change in stress and recovery within the Orphaned Soccer Club players over the course of four years."
25652888,"A literature review is undertaken to assess the efficacy of exercise rehabilitation for older patients in the acute care unit. The results are compared with that of usual care. Mortality at three months is 61, and there are only two predictors: 1) Comorbidities by Charlson's Index and 2) Number of Organ Failures by the Sofa Score. This study uses mixed-models to determine whether or not mortality is associated with physical and mental health status. In addition, it examines the effects of strength testing on muscle mass. Muscle loss is related to length of stay and mechanical ventilation."
30795740,"This study demonstrates the efficacy of an exercise program called the Osteomecise, Strong Bone's for Life, to improve multiplemusculoskeastic and functional performance measure in older adults who have risk factors for falling. The program results in modest but significant improvements in famoral neck and spine BMD, muscle strength, timed stairs climb, 5 p..1, and Dynast balance relative to controls. In addition, the program includes exercises that target ""stepping responses"" that could potentially reduce the risk of falling by reducing the amount of time subjects are forced to move. A novel water-base training program is presented with a cross sectional validity study. Thirty seven elderly were assigned to either group of exercises: resistance or agility groups; they showed improved posturity and reduced fall risk. Two other studies were also presented. One was able to assess the reliability of the Tug test used to predict balance problems in senior citizens. Another was designed to determine the effects of FAST, i.e., another type of exercise regimen intended to increase upper body strength as well as range of motion in old women."
31129504,"At 12 months, there are no significant differences between mean weight change in the control and incentive groups. In addition, they have a mean loss of 0.1 pounds for each group. They also give an incentive to increase exercise adherence among overweight students. The results suggest that exercise is the best prediction of long- term weight loss. A three-month program with financial incentives improves weight losses by increasing walking attendance. Both groups lose more weight than controls during the first two weeks of the intervention period. However, both groups do not achieve improved health outcomes at the end of their follow-up periods."
20091622,"A hazard-free comparison of the risk of death from cancer in men and females aged 40-59 years shows that for men, the relative risk is 1.27. For women, it is 1.00. The study population included 9,706, men aged 18-39 years, 7,760 people aged40-57 years; 1,151 women age 60-74 years at baseline examination in June of 1973. In general, opportune side effects occur in three patients each treatment was given after adequate period of withdrawing from any other hypotensivesive therapy and two weeks of placebo washout. Oxprenilol has a greater reduction in blood pressure than dihydrallazine or chlorhalothiazde. This effect is particularly significant when combined with bendro fluazide, which produces larger reductions on bloodpressure. Both drugs have tolerability but are not as good as either drug alone. Sixteen patients were treated with fixed dose combination therapy. Blood pressure decreases significantly during follow up. All cause mortality was reduced in both groups except for those with type 2 diabetes. These patients also had better control of their blood flow because they had been previously undernourished. They used factorial design to characterize dosage-resense relationships between antihypertensions and different agents"
26359361,"The GRADE approach is a method of evaluating the evidence in trials. It starts with high-quality evidence, but it can be overstated when most of the studies suffer from bias. For example, failure to conceal aloud and blinding may lead to significant loss of follow-up. A guide for meta-analysis is used to assess the extent of risk of bias in observational and randozed trials as well as in omizations. In this guide, authors identify some limitations that are commonly overlooked in these studies. These include: use of improper controls and failureto appropriately consider the intentions-to-treatment principle. This guide also discusses the importance of using an analog scale for pain assessment. Amitripyline was shown to be more effective than placebo in treating patients with central post-stroke pain. However, there were other side effects associated with the many mechanism of actions of Tricyclic Antidepressants. Although no significant effect was achieved at lower dose's, amitratyine did not reach significance when comparing to placebo. There was little difference in quality of life between those with symptoms of stroke and those without symptoms. Late persistent comatose pain was found in 59% of young Stroke survivors and was related to concomitante other pain, impaired qualityof life, and StrOKe localization; however, stroke symptoms were not correlated either with or without CPS. Post-traumatic pain had been reported in 15 patients who had severe acute stroke disease. Later on, after several years of treatment, naclotine failed to produce any pain relief."
21210910,"In this study, patients with bladder-intolerance who have failed alpha blocker therapy receive a combination of toltersodine and tamsonosin. After 6 months, they show significant improvements in Urinary Frequency, Post-void Residue Urgency Score, and Patient Satisfied Score. A total number of 43 men with Brahmin or Luts fail due to an adverse event; only one patient is treated with so lifenacin alone. The efficacy was found in the reduction in urinary flow rates, average Micturition volume, American Urological Society Symptom Score scores, as well as the frequency of urgency episodes. Men with OAB or prostatic obstruction were compared to placebo for their improvement in symptoms. They also showed greater changes in mean International Prostate S score, peak urine flow rate, maximum flow speed, avearatory volume and international prostate symptom score. This study concludes that treatment with either antimuscanics or finasterides reduces the risk of acute retention in men over 50 years old."
25084562,"In this study, we examine the effect of an active physical game on body composition and health in overweight and obesity-affected children. Boys participate more frequently than girls in the exercise group. A randomized, controlled trial was conducted in Australia to determine whether an intervention with an animated game would have a significant effect on weight maintenance and performance. The results showed that young boys were more physically active when they received an energetic active game than those who did not receive one. We conclude that there are differences between the individual, social, and environment factors involved in MVPA among boys and girls. Young boys participated significantly more vigorously than women in both groups. This study is based on two arm, parallel, rand and ommized controlled trials in Australian Newzeal and Canadian Journal of Public Health. Both groups received biweekly telephone calls for five months. Significant improvements were observed for physical activity, mobility fatiguedness score, knee strength, chair rise, walking speed, self-rated fitness, as well their ability to walk at speeds. Within-group improvements ranged from 8 to 35 %. From baseline to week 12, increased nutrition knowledge, reduced perceived responsibility, or restriction were associated with reduction in fat intake. Parents received Education from 'a dietitians' during 3x30 minute sessions to facilitate behavior change. There was no moderating effect; however, mothers received education from ""adietitian"" after four weeks."
30621667,"In this study, we describe the effects of strength training on children with asthma. We compare a resistance-training program to supervised exercise training in patients with severe asthma who have difficulty breathing. Both types of training improve their health and quality of lives. Children with mild-to-severe asthma are assigned to either an exercise regimen or ommed control group. The results suggest that both types may be effective for improving physical function in childhood with disease severity similar to those of adults. This paper also discusses the effect of home-based exercises on cardiovascular fitness, strength, and agility in children suffering from acute lymphoblablastic leukemia."
22701014,"In this study, we examine the effect of daily, weekly, or monthly doses of 2,000 IU of D on serum 25hhD concentrations. After two months, both levels increase significantly in all groups. The results are similar to those reported in other studies. For example, there is no evidence of an association between high-cholestrol status and breast cancer. A pooling project of rarer cancers brings together 10 different cohorts from three continents with participants from various social classes. This study has application for the plan and conduct of interven trials; especially indetermining potential risks during 3 months. Calcium plus vitamin D does not reduce blood pressure or develop hypertension over seven years of follow up Hg. There was no significant change in cardiovascular diseaserisk markers after adjustment for Coronary Risk Factors: multivariate Odd Ratios for increasing Cac Score cutpoints / CaC> 0  10, and 1 p.m. v.1 compared with calcium/D treatment group. Bone Turnover Marks did not decrease at all in the placebo group as were found in patients who received higher dosages"
30953508,"The effects of a six-week program of daily exercise on health-related quality of life and sleep in older adults are described. A meta-analysis is performed to determine the effect of yoga on physical, mental, and emotional well-being as well as sleep quality in people aged sixty-five years. In this study, we assess the efficacy of two different types of exercise for improving health: 1) aerobic exercise training; and 2) an intervention with hypnosis. We conclude that it is possible to improve both physical and mental health by reducing anxiety, depression, fatigue, self-regarding health status, short-term or immediate diabetes, insomnia, brain function, fall prevention, etc."
20008054,"Heart failure is a leading cause of hospitalization for older adults. The aim of this study is to determine whether daily reporting on weight and symptoms would reduce the risk of readmissions, emergency visits, and costs in patients with severe heart failure. This trial was based on telemonitorsement by an advanced-practice nurse. It found that there was no significant difference in the rate of admissions or mortality among patients assigned to either group. However, the between groups did not statistically significantly different. After three months, patients in both groups were assigned one of two care delivery methods: Nurse Telemonitoring/Nurse Telephone support or usual care. They had similar results after 3 months. A pilot study examined the effectiveness of ""a low- technology structured intervention"" to sth and ardizage home health management of patients who had heart failing. In this paper, we report that transtelephony improved the patient's quality of life as well as their ability to control their condition. We assess the effect of novel transtelonic monitoring and follow up program on the attendance rate and lengthof hospital stay aswell as changes in Their subjectively remarked quality Of Life. These findings suggests that delivering disease management through telecommunication devices may be as efficacious as traditional methods. Ninety patients completed the studies through 2 months; thirty percent of them were eliminated before orwithdrawn after enrolling from the study."
29305228,"In this study, we report that reveratrol improves the blood-glucotine levels in patients with Type 2 Diabetes mellitate. We conclude that it may be beneficial to treat such patients because of their increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. This paper also describes a prospective double- blind, placebo-control trial in which subjects were assigned either 200 or 500 mg of randol each day for six months. The results showed no significant differences between the two groups. However, there were some changes in body weight and waist circumference as well as improvements in liver function. A further study was carried out wherein rats were given whey extracts from coconut milk at different concentrations over four weeks. These compounds did not have any effect on other measures of health. Furthermore, they had no effects on inflammation. Thus, these studies are important for understanding the efficacy of various anti-oxidative stress chemicals in treating type 2 diabetes."
28655354,"A randomized, open-label study comparing the effects of analgesis and dexamemethasone on pain and nausea in patients awaiting total hip resurfacing. The Dexasca-Ra treatment group has a lower risk of post-opportunity for nausea during the first six hours after surgery than does the other two groups. In addition, both groups have similar functional outcomes at each follow-up interval. After TKA, there is no significant difference in pain or complications between the two arm groups; however, they do have comparable scores for their total Harris hip Score. Both groups also report improved pain scores over the course of the following three months."
28488684,"The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a daily dose of vitamin D on blood pressure and markers of cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic obstructive rheumatism. In particular, the results suggest that high levels of 25-hydroxyvinculin D may be associated with reduced risk of atherotothrombosis. This association seems to be confirmed by the presence of elevated C-Reactive Protein levels in subjects with low-25-OHD concentrations."
29542875,"The effects of steroid therapy on muscle strength, power, and fat mass in older men are described. In this paper, we describe the results of an eight-month trial using a doubleblind, placebo-control design. After three months, the group showed significant improvements in leg press strength; chest presse strength and power; and loaded stairs climb than placebo. Both groups had similar changes in body composition at the end of the trial. A further study is performed to determine whether or not there is any difference in quality of life among elderly men with low testosterone levels. This study concludes that ""age-specific estimates"" of mean testosterone concentrations vary by year but that estimates of long-term declines in test scores typically outsripe cross sectional decreases"
28192737,"In this study, Sahaj-Yatra's efficacy in the treatment of depressed patients is compared with that of conventional antidepressants. The results suggest that there may be a role for the use of meditation in treating depressive disorders. A pilot study comparing omised and randomed control trials examining pregnantal yoga to perimenval- focused health education in pregnancy was performed. Findings were acceptable and feasible, and women preferred the intervention. There are other treatment options for depression, but no one has yet examined the effects of either type of therapy. For example, studies have shown that it can improve physical functioning and pain, as well as psychological symptoms."
17370290,"After one year, the patients are reassesed on their body weight, menstruals function, and scores on the Morgan scales. Family therapy is found to be most effective in patients who have not yet had a chronic illness before age 19. A controlled trial compares individual supportive therapy with group-based treatment in anorexic nervocasa and Bulimia NERVOSA. The results of this study suggest that family therapy may be more effective for older patients than individual support therapy. In addition, there is no significant difference between weight gain or change in anxiety or depression during the four months of treatment. At 1 year's follow-up, however, some patients undernourished. This study determines whether short-term exercise can improve quality of life but does not reduce the rate of gains of body fat. It also suggests that subjects with ""severe eating-related obsessionsive-complicative features"" respond best to long- term treatment rather than immediate outpatient care."
26186655,"Tibolone reduces the risk of stroke, heart attack, and other aortic events in women with mild to moderate hypertension. In this study, we examine the effect of two different tibitones on blood pressure, lipophosphoprotein, leptoprogenin, factor VIIa, as well as several other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The results suggest that reducing lipogenel concentrations may be beneficial in preventing these events."
23742732,"In this study, we examine the effect of a long-term zinc-supplementation regimen on patients with recurrent acute encephalopathies. The results suggest that it is possible to restore normal levels of zinc and glutamine in these patients. Furthermore, the use of molecular spectroscopies can be used to diagnose hepaticiac disease more directly."
26477805,"In a two-year pilot study, the authors demonstrate significant savings in cost-effective treatment of patients with hypertension. They use an educational outreach program to encourage physicians to practice informed decision-making and prompt them to provide more frequent reminders of recommended drug regimens. The results are similar to those obtained in control groups: blood pressure monitoring is significantly improved by the intervention group, while LDL testing improves considerably more in the intervening group. A1c and heart disease are particularly important in primary care, as they are one of the major causes of death and disdain for the United Kingdom. However, there is little improvement in quality of care after using an EMR system."
31771586,"The first rand and omolized controlled trial of vitamin D in a young athletic population shows that it is possible to improve bone properties by using either 1,500 iu.d. or placebo. In this study, 57 professional Rugby Union players were divided into two groups: one group received 5,000 IU daily; the other group was assigned to receive placebo every two weeks for 11- 12 weeks. Although significant improvements were seen in these players, there was no significant effect on physical performance outcome. A six-week vitD1 supplementation increased serum 25-OH-D2 but did not lead to any changes in muscle function or injury. This study determines if six weeks vita D2 had an influence upon muscle functions, eccentric excitable exercise-induced Muscle damage, and delayed soreness in national Association for Stockcar Auto Racing ""NASCAR"" pit crews. Public health recommends do not separate between vitamin C and vitamin E, yet disagreement remains on whether these forms should be believed to be equivalent. Forty five male and female patients were given 4,000 IV. They showed improved body composition, inflammation, disease, smoking, mass index, as well as age-related loss of muscle strength. These results suggest that 3,000 vile doses are an inexpensive intervention which effectively increased 25H dihydroxyvitamin/D2, which was positively associated with bone measures inthe proxial dual fimur and Mfl. Afteradjusting for physical activity levels, season of collection, serum creatine concentration, chronic disease -- smoking -- and body massindex, persons who had low 25 H diacyvincible concentrations were 2.57 times less likely to experience SarcopeniA than those with high 25 F diacinic concentration"

19592634,"Five adults with Type 2 diabetes undergo a two-week oral glucose tolerance experiment. The results show that the initial concentration of Hba1 is reduced only by the consumption of fructoses, while the subsequent changes in the concentrations and levels of the other endogenous bile are also reduced."
29462158,"In this paper, we describe a novel treatment for children with severe and persistent attention problems. We examine the effect of puffed-alpha polyunstained fatty acids on reading ability in healthy schoolchildren. The effects are modest but significant. For example, an increase in phosphorus content is associated with improved performance on the teacher's Dyslem Questionnaire. A reduction in scores on other measures of attention is also observed. This suggests that there may be some benefit from consuming ecstasy to improve learning."
28209944,"In this study, we examine the effect of a contact force-guided ablation system on the incidence and severity of atrial fillation. The results suggest that the new technology can be used to improve the efficiency of circumferential vein isolation in patients with atrium fibrillation who are not fit for conventional approaches. This paper describes the use of an electrode-based force sensing device to track the patient's forces during interventional procedures. It is shown that it can reduce the risk of heart attack by as much as reducing the time required for procedure."
27492688,"In this study, we examine the effect of total hip amputation on the ability for patients to perform an immediate stop when driving. We conclude that it is safe for older drivers to drive with their upper limbs immobilized in casts and demonstrate that there is no significant difference between pre-and post-surgery brake response time. Acute lumbar fractures are not associated with motor vehicle crashes. However, several studies have suggested that surgery may improve driving performance in older patients. The results of these studies suggest that surgeons should consider returning to driving after complete knee replacement."
23970372,"A controlled clinical trial is designed to determine whether an appropriate exercise program length can be used to improve walking performance in people with peripheral arteries disease. The results of the study indicate that a short two-month exercise regimen may be preferable to longer treatments because adherence and use of equipment are lower perpatient, and more patient can easily be trained for any amount of personnel Time and Re source Utilization Conclusions A supervised walk training program is an efficacious means to increase exercise performance In patients with intermittently claudicious disease, with continued improvements over 12 weeks of training. This treatment involves omizing 19 patients who have ""disabling"" their symptoms by using treadmill walking exercises. These patients show significant improvement in their quality of life at six months' time. They also demonstrate improved walking distance after 6 months as well as increased peak oxygen consumption during the first half of this period. After these studies, it is suggested that there is no need for further investigation into the efficacity of stewardess or home-based physical training in patients suffering from intermittent cleudication."
25848335,"The first three subtrials of the new ADAPT study focus on early surrogates for therapy success. In this trial, 4,936, patients will be assigned to four different sub-trays at 80 trials in Germany; 3,000 patients with hormone-receptive and HER2-negative disease will receive treatment decision based on their risk assessment and response to an induction therapy. This trial has an innovation ""umbrella"" protocol that involves multi-centre, controlled, nonblinded, randomized, or ommized patients. After a period of follow-up, the absolute difference in survival between the two groups is 12 percent. A comparison of doxorbuscin and chlorophospride followed by pacedlitaxel was performed. It was unknown how high tumor total H2T content could influence outcome in breastcancertreated with adjuvenient trastuumab pluschemy. Although no major cardiac dysfunction occurred, quality of life was improved throughout treatment. The European Organisation for Research and Treating of Cancer's EORTC recommended the continuation of TPS137, which had been approved by the North Central Cancer Trials group. There were significant delays in DFS events as well as complications from congestive chest failure and heart failure. Adjuvant transtuberzumabe did not increase the rate of Cns relapse among patients treated with it."
31856826,"The results of this study indicate that a work site-based weight loss intervention is effective in preventing overweight and obesity among young women. In the intervention group, body mass index decreases by 5.7 versus the control group; the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes is reduced by 11.2 compared to the controls. Aims To investigate 'virtual assistance-base lifestyle intervention' to reduce risk factor for Type 2, diabetes in young workers in the informationtech industry in India. This program uses peer health coaches as well as an occupational nurse who provides lessons on how to use physical activity and nutrition to prevent disease."
21197445,"The results of a number of studies suggest that exercise and risk-factor reduction are beneficial for patients after myomyocardial arteriosis. In particular, there is no significant difference in sudden death from the intervention group at one year's follow-up. A study evaluating the effects of physical exercise on coronary disease in patients with an acute myomectal infastruture suggests that this regimen may reduce the risk of fatal or nonfatal events. However, it does not lead to any significant changes in quality of lives among these patients."
25180668,"The results of a prospective, open-label study in which boys with pymosis were treated with topicals for six months showed significant improvement. In addition, the treatment was more cost effective than circumcision. A further study examined the effect of two different types of topical creams on boys who had recurrent or persistent phimosises. Both groups showed improved success and improvement after 24 months. This was followed by another study that evaluated the effects of three different kinds of drugs: triamcinelone, hyaluronicdase, and corticosteroid. These were all highly efficacious at the time; however, they did not show any side effects."
17389701,"In this paper, we report that all three of the most important inflammatory markers predict Type 2 diabetes in women. The odds ratios for each of these markers are 1.64 for TNF alphaR2, 1.91 for IL 6, and 4.36 for CRP. We also present a case-control analysis of blood samples from patients with type 2 who had no previous history of disease or injury. After adjustment by age, BMI, physical activity, month of sampleing, cigarette smoke, and alcohol consumption, were inversed with the serumconcentration of 25-Hysteria D. This is because there is no association between energy, protein, sucrose, carbohydrates, or fiber. However, after controlling for body weight change, food, mineral content, etc., did not lead to greater weight loss than the high-calium diet. Furthermore, it was not associated with any increase in fat or lean mass. Thus, our aim was to determine whether dairy consumption could lower the relative risk of type two diabetes as well as other risk factors such as elevated levels of vitaminD. A diet rich in dairy, fiber, low Glycemic Index, but little fruit, vegetables, milk, nuts, dried fruits, nor animal feeds resulted in greater gains in weight and body fat. There was no significant difference in the relationship between total VD and calcium intake. Although some studies suggest that higher amounts of dairy may reduce the risk among people with more severe forms of heart disease, none of them have been published."
23903267,"This study consists of three groups of patients who have undergone a radical or retropubic surgery. In each group, blood loss is calculated by using the volume and pressure of the fluids suctioning from the surgeon field, bleeding on surgical pads, and the individual patient's hematocrit. The mean blood Loss in the E-A group was less than mean Blood Lose in both theEG group 1810 +/-100 mL; mean + = SEM ; and Conclusions similar blood losses in patients receiving General Anesthesia were not different between these groups. A hundred and fifty prostatectomy patients were assigned to either epidural general anesthesia with spontaneous Ventilation or combined Epidual/General Analgesis. Both groups had significantly lower bloodloss during their operation. They also had no serious complications. Postoperative sedations scores were slightly less in one group than in another."
30977740,"In this study, we examine the effect of wearable activity trackers on physical activity in healthy young adults. The results suggest that wearing them at different speeds will lead to a significant increase in physical exercise. This is an important finding because wear-able devices are not yet widely used in health promotion. We also note that many studies have found no evidence of improved health outcomes with or without incentive. For example, one study showed that using wristbands and smartphone applications could help reduce body fat in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Another study examined the use of fitness tracker and phone app for weight loss in postmenopause patients."
29260583,"This study focuses on the relationship between balance and walking performance in people with several sclerosis. The results suggest that balance-specific exercises are more effective than other forms of exercise for improving balance among multiple musculosity. In this study, we examine the effect of balance training on fall risk in patients with Multiple Sclerosis who have a history of falls. We conclude that there is little evidence for the efficacy of such exercises in preventing falls in persons without relapsed disease."
29513886,"In this paper, the authors present a Bayesian Hierarchical model of two treatment methods. The first is an amalgam material that has higher survival rate than multiple-surture restorations for primary morals over three years; the second is based on Monte Carlo's Markov chain method. This study compares the performance of both materials in treating children with primary caries. Although there are some differences in the color of Dyract and Titanium, no significant differences are found in their efficacy."
29940543,"In this study, we examine the impact of a body mass-index score on long-term and short- term outcomes after acute myocardialty. We find that high-body mass scores are associated with reduced risk of death in patients with an elevated BMI. Furthermore, studies have suggested that higher levels of body weight may be more favorable for survival than low-BMI groups."
32172501,"In this first study, patients with a chronic pain condition were randomized to either 10mg or 20ml of dronal inhalation or placebo. The results showed that the patients experienced improved pain intensity and satisfaction than those who received placebo during the initial week of treatment. This trial was designed to determine whether cannanbinol could be used as an adjuvant therapy for multiple sclerical pain. It was found that there was no significant change in pain scores between groups but mean change was not significant. A double blinded cross-over study was conducted to compare the efficaciousness of cannabis extracts on pain-relief measures in patients suffering from multiple Sclerosis. There was little difference in quality of life when compared to placebo; however, it was noted that more patients took CBM than did placebo reported dizzyness, dry mouth, and sleep disturbance. Furthermore, they found no differences in other measures of pain such as pain score, mood, fatigue, etc. They concluded that ""Chamber-based medicine"" was effective in treating these conditions."
28914815,"This is a small, well-controlled study of Latinos' ability to control their Type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that the intervention may be effective in improving blood glucose control for low- income Latin American patients with type 2, although it does not lead to significant improvements in other measures of health. A culture-based approach to self-management improves both physical and mental health in this population. In addition, the program reduces the risk of adverse events among African Americans who have poorly controlled Type 1 disease. Although there are no significant differences between groups in terms of weight, treatment pattern, adherence or quality oflife, these results support the use ""facially-tailored"" intervention to improve patient care."
28826569,"In this paper, we examine the effects of statin treatment on patients with high-risk heart disease. The results suggest that a low-cholesterol diet can reduce the risk of sudden death or severe myosm in patients who have normal levels of cholesterol. This is important because it may lead to reduced risk for stroke and other fatal events. We conclude that there are no significant differences between daily dosing of simvastin and morning or evening doses in the reduction of total cholesterol by either group. However, our study shows that these benefits are not limited to those with ""primary"" conditions. For example, one patient's blood pressure does not change significantly after two days of use of an antiplatelet medication. A second trial suggests that using pravastain at night might be more effective than taking it at daytime."
27061361,"In this first study, we examine the effects of a combination of vitamin D and E on the treatment of subjects with syphilis. We find that dark skin types are associated with increased risk for vitaminD deficiencies in subjects With Ad, and highlight the possibility that seasonity and locale might be potent contributings to cathecidin inducing through their effect upon steady state 25-OHD levels. This study illustrates that darker skin Types and elevated Bmi are important riskfactors forvitamin D deficientiency in subject with AD ; and highlighted the potential that seasonality may be Potent Contributors to Cathelicidine induction through its effect on steady State 25Hd levels. The aim of these studies was to evaluate the efficacy of IVD on patients with Atopic Dermattitis. They were divided into two group and treated for sixty days. There was no improvement in facial appearance or lichenification as compared to placebo. No complications were seen in either group."
26556568,"In this study, we compared the efficacy of two different regimens of treatment for elderly subjects with high blood pressure. The first regimen was a combination of amiloride hydrochlorostozide or triamterenede and the second was an antihypertinesive regimen consisting of either benaclepril-AMLodipine or thiaretic diuretic. After comparing the effects of these two drugs on both patient health and risk of heart attack, We conclude that they are superior to the other agents in reducing the severity of cardiovascular events among older patients with low blood tension."
31618207,"This paper focuses on the effect of a 8-week exercise program on blood glucose control in adults with Type 2 disease. It finds that participation in this program is feasible and resulted in better weight loss, and reduction in heart circumference when it compared to walking control. The study also concludes that there are no differences between fasting bloodglucose, postpran and iual bloodglycerides, or insulin resistance. However, we suggest that this disorder is probably caused by an environment pressure which may be genetically susceptible. In addition, these conditions are associated with other risk factors such as depression and anxiety. Aim: To investigate the effects of physical activity on patients with type 2, including women who have prediabets. Results: There was no improvement in quality of life after six months of the exercise regimen. Pre-post analysis showed significant improvements in Qol and Indian Diabetesrisk Score in normotesive pridiabetic and diabolical young individuals. Post-intervention analysis revealed significant improvement for Quality of Life scale with P1.001 in group II and IV; p10.001 among group III and V respectively. After three months' practice, blood concentrations slightly declined during the control days butremained stable on stress test day."
28715727,"The results of a prospective, observational study confirms that short-term treatment with fluoxetine does not lead to significant improvement in the severity of bipolar disorder. In addition, there is no difference in time for relapse between patients treated with either regimen. Bipolar I patients have fewer depressive symptoms than other patients and are more likely to recover from their mood episode within one year of diagnosis. A further investigation into the efficacy or safety of long- term amitriptine monotherapy as an initial therapy for biphosphoric disease shows no advantage in reducing depression."
28768649,"The aim of this study is to determine the effects on bone mineral density in a two-year follow- up trial. Bone Mineral Densities and Biomarkers In Postmenopalausal women, aged 39- 60 years, were divided into three groups: 1) soy rich food; 2) hormone replacement therapy; and 3) control group. This study was designed to examine whether the effect of such foods on bones could be related to individual 'equl status'. It was found that there was no significant change in bone turnover between the two treatment groups. However, it was noted that these results should not be confirmed before considering the diet as an alternative to Hormone Replacement Therapy. A double blind, rand and Omized placebo-controlled trials were conducted in healthy ambulator women aged 45-65 years. Women were assigned to either ""isoflavonine-rich sory"" or ""Isof lavone-poor sod."" There were significant negative relationships between total phosphorus per kg and markers of body turnover. Although postmenostausalsal menophusal females were given different amounts of protein, they were significantly reduced in their bone loss. Soy has been used for this purpose since its anti-cancer properties have also been studied. Thus far, only red clover can be used because it has shown some promise in treating breast cancer. Furthermore, studies have suggested that using too much fat may lead to increased risk of heart disease. Therefore, we conclude that long-term consumption of so many fats will reduce the risks of cardiovascular disease by increasing bone mass."
21056534,"A prospective, randomized, open-label study of patients with localized prostatecancer who receive immediate or delayed adjuvant treatment results in a significantly reduced risk of death compared to those treated with standard curative treatment. In addition, the addition of rapid-acting rebuffing to conventional therapy reduces the rate of disease-specific mortality by nearly one-third. The authors conclude that this approach may be more cost effective than traditional approaches for men with locally advanced disease."
23543567,"Telemedicine is an effective treatment for Type 2 diabetes. The patients receive real-time blood glucose results and are able to report their own blood levels or symptoms together with diet changes, exercise, stress, illness or any other lifestyle events. A significant reduction in Hba1c values among the non Insulin-requiring group is observed only among those who use the system. In addition, there is a greater decline in A1,C value than between the groups; this is due to the large number of patient-recorded bloodglucose values that are not recorded at every time. This suggests that case management may be more successful in controlling type 2, especially when it is combined with regular medical care. For older adults with Type 1 diabetes, we introduce elderly-friendly approaches to ""the Clinical Decision Support system"". After six months, all patients continue to do so. All patients improve their health status by improving quality of life, depression, social support, and selfefficacy. We conclude that these improvements will lead to improvement in chronic disease management."
17636684,"In this double blind, multi-centered trial, we examine whether the combination of a single dose of aspidin and / or dipyramole will reduce the risk of death or stroke in patients with atherosciad vascular disease. The results are very similar for both groups. For example, there is no difference between the severity of symptoms after an acute attack and the degree of protection that can be obtained from transient icterotic attacks. This study was registered as an international st and aroused controlled trial. We assigned patients to Aspirin 30 - 300 mg daily ; or withoutdipyrida Mole 200mg twice daily within six months of any major stroke or fatal event. There were no significant reductions in the likelihood either of disabling Major Stroke or  Vascular Death occurring. From 1979 onwards, 6,600 patients were followed on treatments for two years. No change in efficaciousness was found for the 300-mill daily dose but the lower dosage was not necessarily less gastrotoxic. A total treadmill exercise task was performed before the first angular pain. It was observed that changes were observed in all the pain free intervals on the treadmill, ankle arm arterial pressure gradient, oscillatory index, venomous occlesmography"
29334343,"In this study, we aim to assess the efficacy and safety of direct or indirect infant idine concentration. At three months and six months of age, median infant Ury Iodinate concentration was sufficient in the indirect group; whereas infant Uic concentration is sufficient only at 6, months inthe direct supplementation groups. The results indicate that infants' urinary levels are adequate for newborns but that there is still a need for improvement in maternal health in India. This study aims to determine the relative importance of breastmilk vs. infant urine content in women living in areas with the universal salt-iodeization program. It shows that pregnant women have higher than expected thirtolgy and lower milk mg/L when they are not fed with an appropriate amount of food. A positive relationship exists between mothers' Urinary Ion Content and their baby's blood thyropin level."
27859780,"In this paper, we examine the impulsivity of current and past ecstatics using an information sampling test. We find that there is little evidence on reflection in both groups; however, it is more complex than either group suggests. Although exposure to anxiety-provoking drugs such as sethrotonin or benzine has been used for treating anxiety disorders, many patients are given supportive medications like serotonephrine and other antipsychotics. Finally, our study investigates the neurotoxic effects of continued use of a drug called ""MDMA,"" which is known to alter brain serotton 5-hydroxytrypratamine. The results suggest that MDMA may be involved in mediating  impulses and decision making in healthy volunteers. A prospective cohort study was designed to determine whether continuing use would lead to changes in performance in subjects who were already using the drug. It found that subjects with reduced levels of tryphophan showed less ability to learn changeable stimulus reward tasks but that they did not show any significant differences in their performance on the IGT task. Furthermore, studies have suggested that repeated use might induce altered neuromodulations in different parts of the brain."
24401226,"In this study, we examine the effects of a high-fructose meal on blood concentrations of triacylglurol and d-palmitate. The results suggest that both diets may lead to increased fasting and postpranal and daylong blood levels of these two fatty acid sterols. We conclude that ""diets low in addition to added fructoses may be undesirable,"" particularly for men. All subjects receive two isoenkräftec study meals assigned by using an r and Omized crossover design. For men, the FLOSCOSE diet produces significantly higher faster, postpor and Ial,and day long plasma triacelglycersol concentration than did the GLUCOSES diet. This suggests that elevated trigleyceride levels are associated with atherosis, which may result in death."
19244363,"The Consolr statement is a summary of the results of an randote, and it describes how the trial was conducted. The overall adjusted heart rate is not significant; the trend toward reducing risk of incidentlung lung cancer with seaseleum supplementation. A prospective cohort study of 29, 092 Finnish men aged 50-69 years who participated in at least one of these studies shows that selenium treatment has some beneficial effects on mortality. In addition, there are other studies reporting reduced risks of death from disease due to smoking or by diet. Other studies report protective effects of antioxidants among men and women. There are also several articles detailing the use of meta-analytic approaches to detect and assess robustness of scientific evidence."
29096908,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective sample of predolaescent girls with and comparisons who had been followed for 5 years from middle childhood to early/mid adulthood. We examined the ability of measured childhood executive function -- ""childhood predictors,"" with academic, social, andglobal functions serving as young adults critterion measures"" -- to predict functional outcome in later life. The results suggest that there is no specificity of childhood EF but suggests that long-term problems can be prevented by using measures of executive functioning such as working memory or self-regulfing. A study of children with attention-defect/hyperactivité disorder was conducted at the National Institute of Mental Health's CollaborativeMultisite Multimodal treatment Study of Children with Attention-Deficit/Hypteractivity Disorder. After six and eight years, the MTA participants showed significant improvement in their school performance relative to their peers in the local normed comparison group. Medication did not prevent from substance use or suspense by aging; however, neither medication nor cumulative stimulants were associated with analysm. Parents were trained to be ""friend coaches"" for their child with ADHD. This study extends previous findings of association between ear-mouth disease and brain development in girls without and with symptoms of ADHD into young age."
18556637,"This paper focuses on the relationship between patient health values and their mental health status. In this study, we examine the relationships amongst three health-related measures -- time trade off, rating scale, and quality of well-being -- in patients with chronic renal disease who have anemia. The results suggest that there is a good relationship for physical and mental attributes to current health. However, it is not clear whether these two traits are related to one another."
30349359,"In this study, we compared the efficaciousness of botculinum toXin Type A in treating patients with trigeminial nerve pain. The results suggest that it can be used as a treatment for patients who suffer from tense or painful nerves. We also report that there has been some progress in the use of submucousal and local-injections ofbotulinUM toxinA in relieving pain in patients suffering from ""trigeminal nervousgia"". This study is an open-label, placebo-blind, blinded trial designed to assess the effects of single-dose IV doses on pain severity and pain tolerance in acutely ill patients. All patients complete the treatment without side effects. For each patient, they were averaged their quality of life measures by the West Havenyale Multidimension Pain Inventory 'Which Measures are Scored on 0 / 6 Numeric scale'. After the 13 weeks of the trial, no significant differences were found between the primary outcome measure of pain intensity and its pain attack frequency. However, after the 12 weeks, the mean change in pain scores was significantly greater than that of either group at two, four, six, eight, 10, 10, 12, and 12 week post-treatment."
29773575,"The present study focuses on the association between reduced activity level and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. In this study, patients with a high-risk condition for death were compared to those who had remained at low risk of death after adjustment for covariates. This was followed by an extended period of follow-up studies in which patients' daily physical activity was measured. These results were then used to predict future events in patients receiving heart failure treatment."
31328245,"In this paper, we report the results of an eight-year follow-up study on 242 patients with bipolar disorder who received a long-term combination of morphine and lithium. The mean age of illness was ranged from 13 to 18 years, and no patients were available for follow up. After comparing the risk of stopping medication rapidly to that of gradually increasing it, We conclude that there is little evidence of suicide in the absence of treatment for mood disorders."
17253526,"This paper focuses on the association between social disadvantage and sociodemographic factors in a sample of 304 adults drawn from Camberwell, South London. The results suggest that poor social performance is not associated with mental illness but rather with social dissociation. Social Disorganization is more frequent than major depressive or manic symptoms. In this study, the effects of family-based psychoeducational treatments on bipolar patients are examined. Family-centered treatment has been shown to improve patient relapse by improving their ability to recognize early signs of depression and reduce their severity. Bipolar disorder is particularly common in patients who have severe mood disturbances. A recent study suggests that ""family-focused therapy"" can be used as an effective adjunct to opium regimens for patients with milder mood disorders. Although it does not seem to work, several studies have found that using group psychological education to prevent revokes in people with biphosphorous disease shows some promise."
30926099,"In this study, we systematically compare the efficaciousness of mineral trioxice aggregate, Biodedentine, and Propolis for pulpotomes in primary teeth. The results show that MTA is more successful than either of the other two agents at a mean follow-up period of 3 months."
19959485,"The narrator reports on the progress of the I-Clinical Delivery system in India. In this paper, we present the results of a national evaluation of its efficacy and cost-effectiveness for improving maternal and child health in two blocks of rural areas. We find that women who are employed by the Lady Health Workers have more use of modern contraceptive methods than those who live in control areas; however, there is still some unmetifacting evidence about the effectiveness of these services. For example, infection with hematogenism is almost identical in both comparison and non-interventional districts during the Integrated Manor Care program. However, when compared to routine care settings, the cost per child visits is lower in the integrated management of childhood illness. This suggests that improved quality of care can be achieved by investing in better systems support."
26876624,"The aim of this study is to determine the effect of a lifestyle intervention on patients with Type 2 diabetes who are at high risk for heart disease. In this paper, we describe an eight-month program that reduces blood pressure and body weight in overweight women by using behavior change techniques. At six months, both groups have significant reductions in their absolute weight as well as changes in body massindex. This suggests that exercise is the best prediction of long- term weight loss. A pilot study has been conducted in two rural regions of Ho Chi Minh City, Hungry province, in order to assess the effects of health promotion on prepromenopaual women's health. After observing the prevalence of risk factors among these women, the treatment group was significantly better than the control group; however, it did not improve any of the other riskfactors. Another study compares the efficacy between telemedicine and self-help approaches for improving physical activity among men with type 2 Diabetes. Both groups lose weight but there is no difference in waist circumference. Two studies have been performed on different types of diets: one describes ""a Mediterranean diet"" compared to another which is based on low-fat foods; the second describes hypnosis. These studies suggest that either approach may be effective in preventing or reversing the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in people with poor habits."
26083089,"Thirty four patients have received the planned treatment, and this study focuses on bonding glass posts to root dentin. The highest strength of cements is obtained for Clf, which is not significantly different than Panavia, Egc, or Var, but significantly lower than Van, Unicem, Cem etc. When examining the effect of push-out bonds on fiber posts, the results are compared with that of other cement systems. In particular, there is a significant increase in the bond strength among the groups A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, RXU, Self-adhersive cement, self-etch Adhesives, total etchable cement; and dual cure cement."
29115188,"This study focuses on the effects of a stand-stand and workstation system on sitting time, vascular health, and muscular pain in office workers. It is based on two arms, parallel- group, individually re-evaluated control trial. The results indicate that this system reduces back pain without significantly affecting entry efficiency. In addition, it does not affect recall performance or short-time memory. A comparison between the sit-stand and working station groups was made. Both groups showed significant reductions in sitting times. However, they did not show any change in fatigue or musculonoskeletal discomfort. They also found that there was no difference in the length of time spent sitting during the day. Furthermore, both groups reported reduced back injuries."
23450577,"This paper presents the results of a three-year, school-informed physical activity intervention designed to reduce overweight and obesity among American Indian girls. It is shown that this intervention has significant effects on both body composition and fitness in middle-aged girls; however, it does not lead to any significant changes in diet or behavior. In addition, there are no significant differences between the levels of exercise and food consumed by control subjects. The main aim of the trial is to test whether an intervention using heart-rate response prompts increased physically activity in primary school children. After six months, the treatment group reduced household television watching, fewer meals eaten while watching the program, and improved weight gain among Hispanic daughters. A cluster-randomized pilot study was conducted with 4905 children from low-society neighborhoods. All 21 children were completed in the study. Children who received the machine-based intervention had increased knowledge, physical activities, selfefficacy, social support, decrease meals skipped, but they did not show any change in fat mass. They also showed less improvement in step counts as measured by accelerometer tests than controls. However, their knowledge of which food contained more fat appeared to be higher in students receiving the same type of training."
28153024,"The mean lipoprotein concentrations in the first, second, third, and fourth quadiles of the Counties of Cleanhearts were 60, 34, 22 and 19mg/dL respectively. These figures are consistent with an association between elevated levels of lipogenetism and increased risks of myocardia. In this study, fifty patients with type IV hyperlipidemia were treated with micronized bezafiderate 200mc/day. This treatment significantly reduces the risk of fatal heart attack from 21.6 percent to 4.2 percent. A combination of atorvastain and fenifibrate was superior to simva statin in reducing both high-denity lipodyprotein cholesterol and low-DLC-C. Both drugs reduced the rate of death from cardiovascular events, nonfatual myofasis, or stroke. However, neither drug did improve left ventricular functions during exercise in these patients who had previously been at risk for heart disease."
25236307,"In this study, the effects of probiotic treatment on infants with low birth weight are compared. There is no significant difference in the risk of developing necrotizing Enterocolitis when treated with either Lactobacilus casei or Bifidinobacterium acidophilus. However, there is a significant reduction in incidence of Nec-stage 2 by Bell's Criteria. The main objective of the study was to determine whether bovinelactoferrein, alone or combined with Lignobacillus G, reduces late-onset enterocololitis in preterm babies. No adverse effects were reported. A double blinded trial was undertaken to assess the efficaciousness of Probiotics in preventing Necroxis for very lowbirth weight prematurely. It was found that both groups had similar results during hospitalization and did not have any differences in terms of disease severity. Both groups showed reduced rates of NEC as well as changes in feeding intolerance. Later, we investigated whether Lacticillin GG could colonize the immatures bowel of early-born newborns. This study involved two groups: one group received milk feeds; the other group contained LacTobacllus gg. These studies were followed by an extended observational registry of neonates who had at least one infection during their first visit. They concluded that these patients were more likely to survive than those without infection because they were susceptible to Gram-negative pathogens like enteromeculaceae, yeasts, and staphylocontia. After further investigation, it was determined that Lactopicillin does not significantly reduce the frequency of UTIs but increases the velocity of blood flow in extremely low pregnancy."
31114271,"The topic guide for self-management of Type 2 diabetes was based on the assumption that there were many barriers to this type of care. This paper presents an evidence-based approach to improving self management among patients with Type 2, particularly those with high blood pressure and poor health. It uses a mixed-effects model to examine the association between depressed symptoms and improved selfcare behavior in patients who have low levels of depression. In addition, it suggests that even low degrees of depressive are associated with poor patient selfefficacy."
25008420,"The results of this study suggest that exercise training can improve health in older women. It is a well-known fact that physical activity has been associated with improved health, but little is known about the long- term effects of exercise on mental health. A recent study suggests that walking and other forms of moderate intensity exercise may be beneficial for improving health among older people. This paper also discusses the use of strength training to prevent falls and improve blood pressure in elderly people who are at risk of stroke."
28258581,"The results of this study suggest that anabolytic steroid treatments can be used to induce a rapid increase in body weight and composition in endurance-sportsmen. In addition, it has been shown that meth and Ienone are more effective at suppressing the production of testicular glycerics than do either of these two compounds."
19608724,"This is a prospective, i.e. random, controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mud baths on patients with Fibromyalsgia. It was found that both groups had significant relief from pain and fatigue in the first group, but they did not show any improvement in other symptoms after the second group."
29909748,"Telemedicine is an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes. In this study, a group of patients with Type 2 were telemonisted to improve their blood glucose levels after 6 months. The mean A1c values were significantly reduced in the iBGstar ® group than in control group. This was due to the patient's older age and time spent at home. After six months, there was no significant change in A 1c value between the two groups. These results suggest that ""telehomemonitoring"" may be useful in controlling Type 2, although not conclusively because of small sample size."
22115901,"A substudy of a doubleblind comparison between blood pressure lowered with perindomepril - indapacami v. placebo, followed by an open comparisons of the triumvirate's treatment against conventional therapy. The results were not significant: patients had lower levels of glucose than those on either regimen; no significant improvement in nerve function was seen over two years after surgery; and there were no major side effects. In this study, 5238 patients who had type 2 diabetes were treated with multiple drug combination and behavior modification. After 1 year, the change of intensity of control in the group that invested intense glyceric and lipid controls was significantly different from the groups of conventional treatment. This trial is registered as ""an International Stand and Ard R and Omised controlled Trial,"" number NCT00000925."
25841251,"The aim of this paper is to compare the effects of telemedicine and self-care on blood pressure control in patients with high risk for heart disease. In the phone group, there is a significant improvement in both body weight and physical activity over two years. A further study is presented wherein it is shown that an intervention using short message service can reduce cardiovascular risk factor among postmenopauses with abdominal obesity. It is concluded that this intervention does not have any additional effect on improving risk factors among people with elevated risk. This study was designed to determine whether an individualized tailored lifestyle intervention would improve total cholesterol, low denity lipoproprotein cholesterol; high density Lipoproteincholeride; trigllycerides; and sytolic bloodpressure. After 12 weeks, these changes are observed in all outcome measures. These results suggest that ""an individually tailored life intervention did nothave an additional efficacy in improvingCVD risk indicators"" among persons with increased risk."""
21527847,"In a single-group, open-labeled pilot study in 111 patients with uncontrolled hypertension, we examined satisfaction with the program and feasibility of using telemetry to improve blood pressure. The results were similar to those reported in the office: ""The relative ratio for each 10 mmhg increase from baseline to following-up."" This was an important finding because it showed that there was no difference between daytime and nighttime bp pressures. A further study was performed on 5292 patients who had not been treated with any type of treatment. After follow up visits at six months and twelve months, nymphoism fell by 17.1 mill Hg; this was due to patient nonadherence. Telemonitory treatment resulted in greater reductions in both systelic and diatstolic BPM than the improved utmost control group. From pre- and post-tests, the results suggest that self-management ofhypertensesive treatment represents animportant new addition to controls of hyper tension in primary care."

The results showed significant improvement for both groups, with no difference in Urodynamic and Urological parameters. Aims to assess the effect of resiniferateatoxin on women with overactivity or urgency inconsolence. This study is a double blinded placebo controlled trial that compares efficacy as well as safety. It was found that there was no significant difference between symptoms severity or Quality of Life outcomes between the three groups. In this case, weight loss intervention improved urinary inconstinence episodes by 12 months. Women with stress or urge-intolerance were divided into two groups: G1 received acupuncture; G2 received deep abdominal muscle training; and PFM received pelvic floor Muscle training. Both groups had similar improvements in their urine leakage frequency and severity. They also reported significantly improved quality of life measures after six weeks of treatment. These studies are registered at Ct.gov."
26130315,"In this paper, we describe the results of a long-term trial of women who have been treated with both progestine and oetrogen for several years. Women in the combined treatment group report less hot flushing, sleeplessness, and vain dryness than those in either group. Estrogan therapy does not increase breast proliferation or improve mammography. However, there are some reports that use of synthetic estrogens may lead to increased risk of stroke, heart disease, death from another cause, as well as total cancer. This study also examines the effects of changing menopause on depressive symptoms while controlling for pre-depressive status. The effect of transdereal estradol on brain function is studied in older women free of probable depression. A double- blinded, placebo-control study was conducted to determine the efficaciousness of 17betha-estrayole for the treatmentof clinically significant depressed disorders in endogenologically confirmed postmenopalausal women. Although no significant differences were found between actively treated and placebo in quality of life, they were nonetheless similar in their severity of mood and mental health. Furthermore, these results suggest that low dose hormonal regimens can be effective in treating depression in early postmanopausals."
26885527,"In this paper, we examine the costs of a lifestyle intervention for people with Type 2 diabetes. We find that the intervention is more cost effective in terms of improving their health than it does for other risk factors. For example, an intervention to improve blood pressure could save about $800 per year over ten years. However, there are still important drawbacks in the study: patients with severe Type 1 disease have higher mortality than those with no such condition."
28488799,"This is a pilot study to investigate the efficacy of moderate intensity, individualized exercise intervention on physical fitness in patients with colorecTAL cancer. The results are negative for all three primary factors: oxygen up take at estimated anorobic thresholds 2.4ml. kg1min1, and pulse / 100 beats per minutes. In this study, prehabilitation is used as an aid to improve patients' performance before their surgery. A total of 452 patients were involved in complications during the first two weeks of the trial. After six weeks, fatigue was reduced by 77 pg. compared to those who had no change ordeterioration. Post-nacrt treatment showed improved health-related quality of life. Both training regimens seem to have significant effects on patient health status. Pretreatment also seems to reduce fatigue in men with rectalcancer. These studies suggest that moderate intensified, one-onone exercise training may be more effective than resistance exercise in treating these patients."
32024269,"The results of this study suggest that exercise may be able to reduce the severity of burnout and improve physical health in patients with severe exhaustion. In contrast, other studies have found no difference in the preventive effects of exercise on injuries among amateur players when usual care is compared against a regimen consisting of core stability, eccentric training for thigh muscle, propriatory training, dynamic stabilization and pleyometric exercises. This paper provides four additional explanations for how trials report similar outcome. For example, one study reported that an exercise intervention was more effective than placebo in improving fatigue but did not lead to improvement in mental or physical performance. Another study examined the effect of regular physical activity on brain plasticity."
12137717,"In this study, we examine the effect of aprophylactic breast feeding on the risk of developing asthma and octopy in infants aged 6 to 12 months. We conclude that an extended period of exclusive breast-fed care is associated with reduced risks of asthma as well as fewer symptoms for children who have family history of food allergy. The results of this trial suggest that there may be some benefit in using cow's milk instead of breast milk during the early stages of pregnancy. However, these studies do not reveal any protective effects against the development of disease in preterm or premature infanthood."
29930690,"This study focuses on the effects of an alpha-lioic acid, or ALA, on heart sympathetic dysfunction in patients with Type 2 diabetes. In this study, we examine the association between elevated levels of C-reactin and inflammatory markers in type 2 diabetic patients. The results suggest that increased levels may lead to development of Type 2, although there is no clear evidence for this association."
30519027,"A randomized, double- blinded, placebo controlled trial in Japan compared the efficaciousness and safety of an ointment called rispirone to prevent relapses of irritable symptoms in children. In this study, subjects receiving naive doses received a greater improvement in their body weight than those receiving placebo.

In this study, patients are divided into two groups: the control group receives the guideline by mail and the intervention group takes an active approach. Both arms show superiority in cost effectiveness when adjusted for different health care utilization before patient recruitment and clustering of results. However, there remains still no consensus about the effective implementation strategies. A cluster-randomized trial is conducted on 100 general practice practices from the North Danish region. This study will evaluate whether ""a complex / multifaceted implement strategy"" of low back pain guides reduction secondary care Referring and improving patient outcomes comparing to the ordinary simple implementation scheme. First, it is decided that both arm's approaches will be more cost effective than the other. Second, they will also have better quality of life as well as improved patient satisfaction. Third, evidence regarding the cost efficacy of active implementation has been sparse. An economic evaluation is performed alongside the trial to assess how much money can be spent on an extended education strategy to promote the Canadian C Spine Rule. It is concluded that the short term effectiveness of such an education program was not significant when weighed against the costs of sending printed information; however, practitioners who received the print were less likely to comply with these recommendations. Finally, the effect of implementing based on theory was seen only through diminished advice of prolonged bedrest and passive treatments and increased exercise. At the end of follow-up, Back Pain and Functional Status were assessed at pre-basement, 3 months, and 6 month."
28547135,"In this paper, we examine the relationship between sitting time and death in a sample of 17,113 Canadians aged 18-90 years. After adjusted for potential confounding, there was an increased risk of mortality among higher levels of sit time from all cause. There was no association between physical activity and mortality but not cancer. Although moderate to vigorous physical activities are associated with premature mortality, it has not yet been fully explored. This study also explores the relation between sedentialary behavior and bone stiffness in children. We find that smoking is associated at high frequency with an increase in fracture risk in males. A comparison of boys and girls shows that sports participation increases upper limb injury by reducing the risk for both wrist and arm fractures during the first three years of age. The results of this study suggest that exercise may be beneficial for improving bone health in young adults."
24161014,"The results of this study suggest that the use of a total ankle replacement is an appropriate treatment option for patients with recurrent ankle pain. Afraid of complications, however, surgeons frequently perform ankle fusions. This technique is more successful than the other two methods. In addition, the patient satisfaction is high and the long term outcome is comparable to those of other reported methods"
24500368,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights uses a combination of molecular-sequence and x-ray absorption to study the effect of supersaturations on the formation of HAP-like crystallites."
30383133,"In this paper, we describe the cost-efficacy of a lower dose of war farin compared to that of an atrial fibrilation regimen. We assess the association between major bleeding and mortality in patients with acute atrium fibrillation. Apixan is an attractive treatment for stroke prevention because it reduces major blood loss but does not increase the risk of stroke nor systemic embolilism. The rateof majorbleed was 3.3% per year in Warfarin; 2.7% peryear in Apxaban; and 1.9% per years in Darbigatran. Anemia was more likely to be associated with major wounds than with other causes. This study also examines the safety of aspirin on the efficiacy and safety when comparing warfari and riva Roxane. It found that apixenab was superior to both drugs in terms of preventive measures against stroke or systemick embolism among patients who had previous strokes or heart failure."
19496021,"In this paper, we use an individualized quality of life measure, the Seizol, together with another test to determine if response shift will influence the treatment effect in edemtulous patients. The results indicate that there is a significant improvement in health status after total hip replacement over six months. This study further uses the patient-generated report as evidence of the efficacy of treatments using outcome-based measures. A comparison between the three-month scores obtained by the seizul-dw and the short-form health survey shows that changes in these measures do not alter the overall qualityof life score."
32111637,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether the recently-developed Emotional processing scale-25 can be useful for demonstrating BAPit-associated changes during patients with fistiose disease and whether changes in it are associated with improved mental health- related quality of life, and post-results If they were interested in participating, they should be given further booklets on DS. Aim To determine what psychological intervention might be effective in treating patients who have dissociative nopileptic epilepsy. Two small pilot studies suggest that CBT may be efficacious in reducing seizure activity and improving aspects of psychological function and psychosocial distress. Methods/Design We aim to enroll 500 subjects to this screening phase. In comparison, patients receiving an initial diagnosis and Psychiatric Consultation demonstrated reduced PNES frequency; accompanied by improvements in qualityof life and psychological discomfort. This paper describes the use of a medical record audit to identify the extent of somatification among patients suffering from such disorders. Medical care utilizattion was calculated using automated encounters for the year prior to the index visit. Outcomes were measured at eight weeks following hospital discharge. There was significant reduction in severity of symptoms from baseline to nine months in both groups but not in either group. Quality of Life was negatively associated With fatigue as well as depression. Severity fatigue was present in all patients except for those with non-medical disease. Fatigue subdomains had been correlated to anxiety and depression although not self-rating motor symptom intensity. For multivarable regression analyses, physical functioning or pain were also taken into account"
25886655,"Clonidine, combined with Meth-Mh, is more effective for treating children with attention deficit disorder than placebo. In addition, a significant reduction in the investigator's rated ADHD Rating scale is found with Oros treatment compared to other treatment groups. The efficacy of methylphini date on academic performance and behavior were studied in 45 children who had attention deficit or hyperactivity disorder. No significant improvement was seen relative to placebo during both treatment weeks; however, safety was measured by adverse events, laboratory parameters, vital signs, and physical exam. Both treatments were well treated. Children with mental retardations and attention-disability disorder were also studied. Although no significant improvements were seen between the two groups, they were highly tolerated"
25831962,"In this study, we examine the efficacy of a self-regarding intervention in patients with Type 1 diabetes. We conclude that it is more cost effective than conventional treatment for treating disease. The results of this trial indicate that Ciliatriinibii improves patient satisfaction and quality of living when compared to subcutaneous insulin. A European trial in eight countries assesses the subjective well being of patients using the 28 item Well Being Questionnaire, which covers four dimensions of depressedness, anxiety, energy and good well-being. This assessment confirms our previous work on the WHO Five Well-Beling Question Survey. It was found that there were no significant differences in alcohol habits among the general population. Furthermore, the Indian version used by the World Health organization as identifies depression in elderly people. These results suggest that depression may be associated with small basal lesions but not white matter grade."
24100440,"In this study, infants with a severe case of colic who are not breastfed receive probiotics for seven days. The rate of response is higher in the Probiotic group vs. placebo group on day 7 and 14; relative risk is 4.3 versus 2.3 compared with that of the placebo-treated group. Atopic dermatis is less frequently observed at 6 months after receiving either treatment. This study examines the safety, tolerance, and preventive effects of an experimented -lactobacilus reverberi or simethcone on infantile concholic. At six months, there was less clostabacilli in babies' faces than in those treated with placebo. After two years, however, no significant differences were found between the Lactobillus Reuteri group and the other groups. Both formulas had similar growth and bowel motility during the first three months of life. Infants received the L-reviti daily for 28 days as part of their regimen."
32346802,"The results of this study indicate that a 10-day saffreon regimen is safe for patients with acute ankle pain. In the control group, however, there is no decline in the maximum strength and sorenes after eccentric exercise. A further study has shown that aspirin can be used to treat pain caused by exercise-induced injury. This paper provides evidence towards an easy accessible stimulus for improving bone health. It also shows that consumption of anti-inflammatory agents such as ibupropen or naproxen may reduce the effects of resistance exercise training on older adults. Twenty healthy men who respond to athletic complexes have been assigned to four groups: 1) physical activity, 2) Ibupropen, 3) physical action, and 4) nabidone. They are assigned according to their age, height, weight, body mass, white blood cell count, creatine levels, etc. These subjects were divided into four different groups before being assigned one of four treatment groups. Each group was assigned based on its ability to prevent delayed onset Muscle Soreness. After two rounds of running, both groups showed significant reductions in muscle damage at 24 and48 hours. Nabumethone did not change the renal response but did increase excretion rates."
25262686,"Two hundred four consecutive symptomatic patients were assigned to two different ablation strategies: pulmonary vein isolation, PVI, and left-atrial linear lesions. The first scheme was paroxysal or persistent atrium fibrillation; the second scheme involved a single operation with recurrent AF. After completing their procedures, the overall success rate for long-term control of arrhythmies was 39 p.m. in the ""PVI plus ll"" group. A long term follow-up is not considered permanent because there are still recurring affilations after the first one year. In this study, we compare the efficacy on both groups of patients using cryo balloons as an alternative to medical therapy. We conclude that it is possible to use these devices in patients with severe left valvular dysfunction. Although our samples size was noner and ommized, our results suggests Pvi may be able to be used in those with impaired ejectionfraction."
22430458,"This paper focuses on the early-onset of language development in preterm infants. Preterm children exhibit higher scores on measures of intelligence, motor function, and language understanding than their term-matched peers."
21404024,"In this study, we compare the wear of cementless and cemented hip replacements for eight years. The results are very similar: there is no difference in pain at any point during the follow-up; however, the prosthesis wears at a higher rate than the cemented cup. Forty two hips have required femor revision because of loosening. This study also shows that although the Charnle prothesis has improved over time, it does not last as long as the other two methods. For example, patients who had been treated with only cement were found to have less bone loss after surgery. A prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of single-screwed total hip resurfacing was performed. It showed that both types of prostheses could be used to achieve superior results in terms of pain and function."
32314257,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective, i.e., controlled Swedish obesity study. We report that after gastric surgery, subjects lose an average of 5.51 g/m2 in weight and gain an additional 18.03 ng.m. in body mass at the end of the paper."
32350578,"In this study, we compare two different methods of knee resection to determine the effect of each technique on joint line position and function. We find that the measured rand-omized technique results in better results than the conventional method. A significant correlation is found between neutral leg alignment and higher knee scores only in patients who have preoperative nonvarus or constitutional varus alignment. Level of Evidence Diagnostic study; Level 2 Methods The patient population was included for further investigation. There were 38 patients with primary total kneearthroplasty performed using either the standard procedure or the newer approach. The aim of this trial was to compare the difference in the frequency of contact between the two approaches. At 3 and 12 month postoperation, all patients undergo biplanar imaging at a range of motion, including the Knee Societies Score, the Western Ohio and McMaster's universities Osteoarchitis Index,the High-Fulxion knee score, and theForgotten Joint Score"
26146874,"In this study, we examine the effect of a single dose of alcohol over three hours on smoking behavior in heavy smokers. We conclude that patients with low dopamine levels may be more likely to respond better to treatment than those with higher levels of DBH. The results suggest that genotypes of these patients might be useful as they relate to their response to levocopa and carbidopane. Thirties-one cocaine dependent patients were genotypized for the D'bgr:H gene; seventy- one cocaine-dependent subjects who participated in an eight-week double-blinded placebo-control trial of Levodoprocin or CarbidomepA were genetically assigned to either D&BGr;H or DRD4L genotyping. This study was designed to determine whether olanzepine is effective at preventing cue-evoked craving after consuming three drinks. After two priming doses each, participants completed subjective measure of craving but only reduced Cue Elicited Craving after each drink. These interactions would be considered in consideration when considering disulfirum treatment in cocaine dependence. A single primary Care facility in Edinburgh has been established where half of the patients have poor health related qualities of life. Further research is necessary to investigate the effects of average durationof opiate substitute treatment on drugrelated mortality. It is found that there is no difference in the risk of addiction between methadone replacement therapy and buprenoriphine treatment. However, it is suggested that some differences are due to variations in genes involved in alcohol and drug absorption. For example, several different types of receptors can lead to different levels"
18199086,"In this study, we examine the effect of early breast feeding on infants with high-risk atopical disease. We find that in the first two years of life, there is no significant difference in symptoms between the control group and the preventive group. The cumulative frequency of food allergy is significantly lower in these groups. Asthmatic disease is the leading causes of admission to hospitals in Australia. Although it is controversial whether breast milk protects against or prevents asthma or osty, many studies have suggested that exclusive breastfeeding for at least four months may reduce the risk of an asthma epidemic. A prospective cohort study has been conducted in Western Australia to assess the effects of extended breast feed on children's health. After adjustment for cofactors, the introductionof milk other than cow milk before 4 month of age was associated with reduced risks of asthma as well as recurrent coughing. This study concludes by examining the relationship between breastfed infanthood and wheevering during the initial six months of their lives. There are only minor differences in allergic reactions among the different groups; however, they do not differ in IgE scores or family history. Furthermore, both groups show reductions in severity of acute illness from birth to 6 months. Finally, our study suggests that long-term use of soy milk can be beneficial in protecting against opportunities for immune responses."
27769955,"This study focuses on the effects of an eight-month web-based treatment on older adults with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The results are very promising: improvement in quality of life, depression, social support, and selfefficacy. In addition, the intervention improves patient health by improving their psychological well-being. For example, patients who receive the Web-Based Diabetes Self-Management program show significant improvements in their physical health and improved satisfaction with the care they receive."
26552695,"A cluster-retrieval trial is used to assess the effectiveness of an individual worksite intervention program among professional workers. The results show that exercise and a change in body posture are associated with improved health, but there is no significant difference between the two groups for pain severity or functional status. In addition, both groups experience significant reductions from pre-to postwork periods under either schedule. This study investigates the effects of workplace exercises on neck and shoulders pain as well as upper arm pain. It is concluded that this intervention can be more effective than other forms of treatment because it reduces risk factors such as stress and fatigue."
17943751,"In a double blinded, rand and Omized crossover study, the effects of soy and wheat diets were examined on vaginala cytology maturity assessment. The results showed that continuous combined Estrogen plus progestion therapy may increase risk of omenal cancer while producing Endometrial Cancer rates similar to those obtained by placebo. This trial suggests that continued combined estrogen-progesterin therapy might increase the risk for ovarian malignancy while giving rise to endometrically more dangerous cases. These studies provide additional support in caution in using continuous combination hormones. Women assigned to either regimen had fewer hotflues than women assigned only to conventional hormonal therapy. Soy extract did not increase breast denition in this population; however, it did improve menopaual symptoms. A total number of female patients completed the trial. After 57 women received 60 g per day of isolated or casein placebo, they reduced their mean numbers of hot flushings over 12 weeks. They also found no significant change in blood or urinary markers of severity as compared to other treatments. Their average age was 54 years. Both groups reported significantly less pain at each time point. Although there were no differences in histology, stage, or grade among the two groups, both groups responded positively to the survey questions. For example, Japanese American women reported less hot flasheses and night sweat when comparing them with European-American Americans. Flax seed reduced serum total but no difference in severity scores between thetwo arms. To determine symptoms experienced in late reproductive years, an African American woman's race was associated with the physiological factors involved in the reporting symptoms: mood and behavior, lifestyle, and gender background. There were neither statistically significant changes in score between group 1 or 2 except for the dimensions of the Kuppermann Index which changed during the intervention period. Purer phytoestrogents improved quality of life in postmenophausal women. It is believed that these herbs have some anti-cancer action. Paranoid events such as stroke or death are suspected because of increased risk from use of synthetic drugs. However, many trials have shown beneficial effects on qualityof life including reductions in cholesterol and lipoprotein levels."
28368091,"In this paper, the authors describe a method for calculating the severity of patients' response to treatment in drug trials. They compare the patient's scores with those of the Clinical Global Impression score, which is used to predict how well they will respond to different drugs. The results suggest that there are limited effective strategies for treating people with dementia. A multiple-time series blinded, experimental design involved comparing the effectiveness of ""therapeutic touch,"" simulated touch, or usual care on disrupting behavior. There were no significant differences between the effects of either treatment and placebo. However, more participants received combined benzodyzepines, alone or together with antipsychos; when compared by placebo or antipsyotics, only one trial showed improvement. This study was designed to develop an auratherapy hand and massage program, and evaluate the effect of lavender aroma therapy on cognitive function, emotion, as well as aggressive behavior of older adults with Dementia of Type IV. It found that staff members who used these measures to prevent patients from engaging in aggressive behaviors reduced the frequency of these incidents."
32340106,"In this paper, the effect of a fiber-post reinforcement on dentin bonding is investigated. The results indicate that it is possible to increase the strength of the post with an in-vitomentary cementation procedure. This can be used to reduce the risk of root canal failures by placing the dowels directly into the canal."
27798366,"The improvement in total work capacity and health-respective quality of life was similar in Middle-aged and Old persons but smaller, although still important in very old people. This study aims to evaluate the association between self-efcacy to do physical activity, as well as blood markers of heart disease in a patient population based on middle aged Swedish men without previous cardiovascular disease or treatment with cardio drugs. After 12 months, patients were randomized to either hospital or outpatient exercise training. Both groups showed significant differences in their performance over time. In particular, there was an increased risk of death from both groups. A one-year intervention was planned to prevent these adverse changes. It was found that home-based exercises could be more effective than regular cardiac rehabilitation for improving body composition and functional capacity."
32198100,"In this study, we examine the effects of a combination of pre- and post-anesthesia warming on patients with wounds infected by severe scarlet syphilis. The results suggest that there is little difference in the severity of the wound infection between the two groups. Pre-warming increases the mean Evan-G satisfaction scores but does not significantly improve patient satisfaction. We conclude that active warming before surgery seems to help prevent wound infections. This study further investigates the use of negative pressure wound treatment in elderly patients who are at risk for spontaneous shocks. It shows that hypothermial therapy can reduce the risk of sudden shock from all types of surgery."
24564520,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates that a ""conditional cash transfer"" program is associated with improved maternal health in rural Mexico. This program improves the quality of pre-eclamation care for poor women in Mexico by reducing the number of children who are stunted or overweight. The results suggest that there may be an advantage in using cash transfers to improve child health outcomes in low-society countries."
17563549,"The efficacy, safety, and effcacy of valartan 160mg and amlorodipine as an antihyportensive treatment in patients with moderate to severe essential hypertension. Both drugs are well tolerated; however, the combination produces significant reductions in blood pressure from baseline in 24h mean bp and DBP after 6 weeks. After 12 weeks, all active treatments produce significant decreases from base in 24-h means trough: peak ratio--peak ratio is not significant. All three groups were equally effective at reducing bloodpressure during the day, night, or overnight. A doubleblind trial was performed whereby patients were treated either with a single dose of vasartans 160 mg or with one hundred milliliters per day. Two hundred patients completed the trial. One patient received eprostasan at 600 and 1, 200 mg once daily while the other was given either placebo or enalpril. In both regimens, there was no significant difference between the side effects. Although neither drug had pronounced changes in absolute blood flow, they did reduce it significantly for the first eight hours after wakening. This study compares the effect of two different agents on acutely ill patients who have failed to respond to their previous therapy. They found that although each agent reduced blood force more effectively than the others, these results suggest that this particular type of intervention will be necessary for future studies."
30861690,"The British Heart Study, a large, well-known study of heart disease in England, found that high-Density Lipoprotein cholesterol and the risk of sudden death were reduced by covariate adjustment. In this study, patients with atherotic valgus were given either 100mg of anacin once daily or placebo. After three years, the mean LDLcholic level was 42mmol per deciliter; the means low-denishity lipophosphoprotein levels were 76m per Deciliter. A double blinded clinical trial showed that bezafisibrate does not reduce the frequency of myomyocardial arcts or stroke. However, there were no significant changes in endotolhelial function, blood pressure, inflammation, or lipids during the treatment period. This study also did not show any change in the rate of major artery events. It concluded that statins may have some beneficial effect on the prevention of cardiovascular events but that they are not sufficient to prevent fatalities."
24918321,"In this study, Wuthering Heights demonstrates that the use of a probiotic mixture called VSL#3, which is able to treat moderate-to-modestly active ulcerative disease, can lead to relapses in patients with mild to moderate colitis. The results suggest that it may be safe and efficacious to use this new form of treatment for patients suffering from mild or moderate UCDAI."
24814519,"In this study, the results of a split-mouth surgical procedure are compared with that of an earlier loading protocol. The results show that immediate loading of SLA-covered implants can achieve and sustain successful tissue integration for at least five years. A total numberof 106 implants are examined in this trial. At the end of the first year, all patients receive full arch prostheses. After 3 weeks of early loading, no significant differences in bone loss are found between the test group or control groups. All patients are treated with turned Titanium implants."
25178118,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed description of the effects of early-stage statin therapy on patients with acute chest disease. They conclude that it is beneficial for patients to begin early in their treatment because they can prevent major adverse events from occurring. The results of these studies suggest that early intervention may be more effective than conventional medical treatment in reducing the risk of sudden death or myomyocardial arteriosis. A recent study suggests that aggressive lowering of lipids by high doses of citruline reduces the rate of fatal heart attacks and strokes in patients who have had an acute coronarier syndrome. This trial also shows that even though there is no significant reduction in blood cholestrol levels at the endpoint, short-term use does not lead to immediate improvements in patient health."
27717522,"In patients with lower Urgency Tract symptoms, combination therapy of tamisulosolin and extended release oxybutrynin significantly improves the efficiacy of both drugs in terms of improving urine flow rate. The primary outcome is change from baseline on the International Prostage Symptom Score. Both groups show significant improvements in the overall quality of life as well as improvement in urinary symptoms after 12 weeks. A comparison between two different treatments was made: Solifenacine 6m plus tocas improved storage symptoms but did not significantly increase the severity of symptoms in men who had moderate to severe symptoms. This Fdc also improved stored symptoms and reduced the duration of the study period. All three treatment regimens were well- tolerated; however, there were some adverse events. Two studies were undertaken to assess whether alfuzolin 10m once daily, the Pde 5 inhibitor sil denafil 25m OD, and the combined treatment of either on lower bladder symptoms suggestedive of benignprostatic hyperplusa. These studies included 102 patients aged 70.3 years. They were divided into four groups: 1) group 1 received solodosesin 0.2m orally twice per day for 4 weeks 2) group 2 received silldenalfil 0.5m at a single dose each week; and 2) control group received only solacenacin 3m/day. At the end of this study, no significant differences were found between the two subjects. There was no difference in age, prostate volume, Qmax, postvoid Respiratory Volume, etc. Between these two groups. After six weeks, all patients were re-evaluated by their physicians. Their results showed that neither group improved the international prostate symptom score nor improved sexual function. However, they did have an improvement over the placebo group. Furthermore, it appeared to be safer than any other intervention. It was concluded that ""tadalsulisin exhibit superior efficacy"" in improving upper Urgotric Trestick symptoms when compared with those treated alone."
24694271,"In this paper, we describe the results of a novel approach to bone loss in hip replacement. We examine the changes in bone densiput after total hip surgery and compare it to that of straight stems. The short-stemed prostheses outperform the uncemented ones in terms of bone quality and long-term survival. Aim Neck sparing prosthesis is becoming more popular for younger patients. After two years, no complications are encountered. Only one patient undergoes an early revision procedure due to aspid loosening on the stem. This study determines whether neck preservation will be less difficult during the initial 20 hip procedures. Four different endoproses were used: vision 2000/Durloc, ALPha-Fit, Allofit, Mayo, Trilogy. These prosthetics had significantly higher hip scores at 6 months than those with longer stem"
28887086,"In this study, we investigate the blood glucose control of people with Type 2 diabetes by comparing the effect of Cinnamon to that of placebo. We conclude that cinnamon can be used as an anti-diabetic or preventive treatment for type 2 patients. This paper also describes a double blind, placebo-control trial in which fifty-nine patients were randomly assigned to either consume one g of each kind of spice or take prickly needles every two weeks. The results suggest that these small doses of medicine may be effective in preventing or reducing the severity of Type 2, Type 1, and Type 3 disease."
29322626,"In this article, Dr. Rivers discusses the use of the Hall technique to treat early childhood cariies. He argues that it has been used successfully in other trials and that there is little evidence for its efficacy in children's teeth. The aim was to prospectively assess the survival of two different kinds of restorations: resin-modific glass iomer cement and photaci-fil or pre-formed steel crowns. After five years, the replacement rates were significantly greater than those of amalgams; however, both types of material survived intact during the follow-up period. This study compares performance of three different materials in treating primary morals with conventional restorative treatments. Both materials failed over 24 months. A total number of children aged 3 to 8 years with deep caries were included. These patients received either an amalgam filling or a single-surface restreative treatment. They had remarkably good results after three years. There was no difference between the success rate of these two materials but only one failure per year."
30387072,"This study demonstrates that resistance training is equally effective in improving physical performance of older women. The results suggest that the two and three-training sessions/weeks of hsrt are equally efficacious for improving physically performance and qualityof life of elderly women, as well as improvement in muscle strength, power, functional performance, balance, andquality of life. Thirt thirty-three subjects satisfied all study needs and were included into analyses. Periodized resistance trains, specifically bp and dup, or NP resistance train are equal effective for boosting increases in muscularhypnotism, strength; and power among unstrained older men. Both training methods include exercises that require high speed concentric muscles actions. In addition, both groups show similar small improvements in Muscle strength: power --functional performance --balance --and quality of Life compared to control groups. A comparison of four common clinical tests was made in a random sample of community dwelling older adults. These studies showed that combination exercise, agility, jump training, restraint, fatigue, bone fragility, improved health-related qualities of living with older people. However, only half of the benefit seems to be maintained after this intervention. For example, one year after stopping the supervised High-intension training group, subjects gained significant gains in leg extenor force at 60 o'clock versus the control group. Furthermore, there were no differences in bone turnover measures between the different treatment groups during the follow up period. Although not significantly different from the other treatments, the effect of stretching on bone mineral denition was noted. It was concluded that it was possible to preserve good health by multicomponent exercise programs and thus postpose the age related functional problems."
27997978,"Guanethine is a good choice for mild to moderate hypotension, although side effects do occur while taking it. Forty-nine patients are treated throughout the trial with 50mg/day of guanescinde. In step 2 trials, each drug is added in graded d intervals until an initial therapeutic response is obtained. Blood pressure measures and sideeffect scores are evaluated Biweekly. Of 664 patients who complete the study, 375 responders were less than or equivalent to 5mm Hg. The white and black patients responded equally. Fifty patient's suffering from mildto-moderated hypertension were divided into two groups: 25 Blacksand 25 Indians. A combination of sotazides plus chlorthalidene was found to have as effective as those of Sotalol Plus Hydrochloro Thiazde in reducing blood pressure inboth the Black andthe Indian patients. Both treatment regimens showed greater control each week after four weeks; however, both groups reached control of at most 5 mmHhg below the target diastoplic goal pressureof 90 mpH G. After eight weeks of treatment, Dialpazem reduces DBP by 171 ppm. This does not lead to any significant changes in laboratory values. Two drugs were used in this study: alphamethyldopata fourteen patients, serpasil b-m 14 patients, citba vs rerpine 28 mg/d. They did not show any signs of adverse events. All-cause deaths were not different between groups. Main Outcome Measures Morbidity, mortality, and targeted organ function were followed in doubleblind studies of Mild to Moderate Hypertension over three years. There were 96 Strokes, 140 ChemD events, 180CVD incidents among the 2360 active group participants."
23514337,"Pre-Operative Measures of Postoperative Pulmonectomy and Brobdingnagian Lung Resection. The results suggest that a modified walking test can be used to predict the outcome of post-lung resection in patients with low lung function. A comparison of pre-opportunity and repeat measures is made. In this study, we examine the effect of stair climbing on prediction of complications after elective lung roosting. We conclude that there is an association between the change in peak oxygen consumption during the exercise and the reduction in total oxygen saturation during exercise."
26512340,"In this study, we examine the effect of progressive resistance training on depressed older adults. We find that exercise is more effective than st or ard care in elderly people with major or mild depression. A group of sixty communitydwelling patients aged 60 and over were assigned to either high intensity PTT or low intensity PSA for eight weeks. The odds of admission into the hospital were reduced in both groups. At 12 months follow-up, 78 % of those in the control group had further falls. This study also shows that an ""interdisciplinary approach"" can reduce the risk of future falls as well as limit functional impairment. Elderly men with chronic injuries are at greatest risk for falling. They have improved their strength, endurance, mobility, and fall rate. Depressive scores are reduced immediately after the treatment; however, there is no difference between the physical activities modes. All groups exhibit significant reductions upon HAM-Dementia score and BD I scores. However, all groups do not differ on Hamilton's Depression Inventory or Brain Difference Score: P =.0067. After 16 weeks, the subjects did not different statistically on Ham-Disdemona Score or brain function. Furthermore, they showed improvement in self-esteem, anxiety, delayed recall, fatigue, mental health, sleep quality, etc. These results suggest that the Nijmegan Falls Prevention program was effective in improving the incidence of fells in otherwise healthy old people."
24671713,"After five years, all but one restoration is replaced by re-ceramic crowns. The results of this study are that the self-etchable primer system with selective enamel etchation and phosphoric bonding agent performs well in treating non-carous cervical lesions. In contrast, the microfill composite used for restoratives does not show significant improvement in terms of retention or discoloration. A comparison between two different types of adhesives is made: 1) a three step etched-primebond adhesive; 2) an improved resinmodified glass Ionomer Composite; and finally 3) Dyract Ap Polyacid Modified Resin Composite. This study compares the performance of four different materials in the treatment of caries and other nonccarious cervical lasions during the 13-year period. Both systems achieve excellent retention rates. However, they do have some minor defects at the margins of the enamel surface. At least one patient shows superficial staining after 3 years. Retention continues to be good even after 5 years because there is no difference in marginal integrity among the three different material groups."
25324324,"After 18 months, there are 11 deaths in the intervention and 12 in control group. The results of this primary care-based disease management program show that it improves patients' emotional status, quality of life, positively impacted body weight, functional capacity, and lipid profiles, as well as attenuates heart remodelling. In addition, it reduces blood pressure more than controls. This study is a prospective, observational study to assess the impact of nurse-led home health education on patient outcome parameters and outcomes in patients with hypotensive hypertension. Two regions in two different countries were selected: China and Nigeria. Each region was then assigned to one level of care; each region received usual care or an intervention group which applied the Cardiorisk management package. Systlic and diatstolicblood pressure decrease more in intervention groups than in controls"
24118784,"In this study, we investigate the effects of long-term ascorbicacin treatment on endotheal dysfunction and lipid homeostasis in Type II patients. The results show no change in blood flow after two weeks; however, there is a significant increase in tiphoid secretion levels after 2 weeks' use. This is due to the fact that oxidative stresses are involved in the pathophysiology of type II diabetes. A double blind, placebo-control study was performed for forty adult subjects with Type I or Type IV disease. After two week of ascobic acid treatment, the changes in both blood pressure and body mass were not significant. However, they were markedly increased by the addition of 1,800 mg of vitamin C per day. These results suggest that these short-lived treatments may have some beneficial effect on the vasodial function of diabetic subjects."
26708317,"In this study, we examine the effects of a single-dose dose of modalfinil on learning and memory in healthy volunteers. The 200mg group performs better than the control group in tests of response time and attention. We conclude that moda filliver may have similar efficacy to other sedatives because it improves brain function by enhancing the ""neural function"" of regions important for cognition. This is an important aim of the present study; however, there are no significant changes in mood or behavior between the three groups. A double blinded cross-over comparison of mental performance among 18 aging subjects was performed after two weeks of placebo treatment. Both studies showed improvements in verbal recall but did not show any change in physical tiredness or fatigue."
28110383,"This is a prospective, observational study of patients treated for the first episode after acute diverticus. The results indicate that mesalamine does not reduce the risk of developing recurrent episodes in patients who receive it. In this study, we report on the safety and efficacy of using mesolazine as an anti-diversion treatment. A significant increase in the mean value of time to regain normal function was observed in both groups. Furthermore, there was no need for elective or emergency surgery in cases of severe recurring disease."
16435593,"This paper describes a new program of medical treatment for people with AIDS. The initial outcome is that the patients who initially enroll in the program are successful. However, after several months, they drop out. In contrast, the results of the first two trials indicate that there is no significant difference in health status between the two groups. For example, one group reports more trips outdoors during the month before an assessment and the other reports more visits outdoors at four months. These results suggest that changes in disease severity have resulted in improved mobility among persons suffering from AID. A second trial compares an eight-hour education program to an outdoor exercise program. Both groups report improvements in physical function, pain, h, and pain on activities. Arthritas Self-Efficacy scales 2 and arthritis selfefficacy are recorded at 0% and 4 years. Costeffectiveness is examined using cost effectiveness acceptanceability curves. There is only slight increase in mean costs per case but this does not seem to be significant."
19533517,"The St and Ards of reporting trials statement provides guidance for transparent reporting. It focuses on the reporting of theory used and description of intervention, comparison conditions, and methods to adjust for possible bias in evaluation studies using non-r and mized design. Sixtie percent of subjects experience pain of moderate or severe intensity. Inactivity, stress, weather change, overactivity are identified as aggravating factors. Some patients have spinal cord injury, complain of severe painfulness. A prospective long-term follow-up study uses repeated measures to predict whether someone will develop depression two years later after suffering a spinalcord injury. Thirteen subjects who suffered an acute spinal injury resulted in permanent lost movement. No demographic characteristics or injury characteristicssuch as level of lession or completeity of lesion had been related to long term depression. Pain treatment and recovery techniques that improve the individual's belief about their control over their life are therefore recommendable as interventions that can act to reduce depressed persons with spinal Cord injury"
29637113,"In this study, we examine the effects of feeding a prophylactic strain of yeast on preterm newborn infants. The results suggest that Lactobacilus casei may prevent necrotizing Enterocolitis in very low birth-weighed preterminants. We conclude that it is possible to reduce the risk of Necrotising enterocotis by reducing the number of pathogens present in the gastrointestinal tract and by increasing the length of hospital stay for probiotics as well. This paper also discusses the use of Bfidobacterial colonization in prematurely omated infant girls. It was found that Bifibobacterium did not significantly increase the incidence of nosocial infection in pregnancy-born babies. A double blinded trial was undertaken to assess the effect of using bovine lactineferrin alone or combined with LGG on the reduction of late-on-onset separsis in neonates. No significant difference in terms of risk reduction was observed between the two arms; relative risk was 1.27 versus 1.66; P = 0.32; no significant differences were observed among the three arms. There were only minor differences in severity of NEC when compared with the control group: 13 vs 10 %; p.001; but the difference wasn't significant."
23584278,"This study focuses on the effects of age on muscle activity during work and compares the effect of different age groups on these activities. Younger women have higher EMG activity than older women, while older females have lower Emotional Glycian activity. The aim of this study is to determine whether there are differences in the duration of working with a mouse as well as between the two groups of subjects. In particular, it is found that younger women show greater forearm and neck-muscle activity when they use their computers under time pressure or verbal prompting. It is concluded that stress-induced muscular activity may lead to recurrent shoulder pain."
31049758,"In this paper, Lilly focuses on the safety and effectiveness of pembrixed antineolytic agent in advanced nonsquimous lung cancer. He concludes that it is safe and efficacious for patients below 75 years old with advanced disease. A double-blinded trial compares two regimens of combination chemotherapy to determine whether or not bevaciumab prolongs overall survival after failure of first line or secondline treatment. The results suggest that beevavizumabe is more effective than gefitnib at improving progression-free outcome in patients with moderately aggressive disease who have been treated with other agents before. This study also describes the use of enlisting of volunteers in a pilot study of advanced small cell lung tumors. It was found that there was no significant difference in response rate between the two groups but that they were well toleranced. Bevacinibu was superior to crizotil in terms of duration of response; however, the risk of death was still high when compared to gemcitabin."
28258777,"Four health behaviors combined predict a two-fold difference in the incidence of stroke among men and women. The results of this study do not support the conclusion that intervention improves health behaviours, well being, and social outcomes. A cluster-rand and Omized trial of Well London found no evidence of effect on primary outcomes; healthy eating, relative risk, 1.04 p..95 % c.1.00; physical activity, RR:01.01, 95 percent CI 0.91 to 1.17; abnormal GH12, R:1.15 --95%) /CI  3.93 to 0.87 ; wemwbs mean difference, M.D: 5.00 vs. 7.92 d."
20416377,"A self-reporting survey of US college students who are male, white, members of the fraternities or sorority and earned lower grades point averages. Modafil improved certain aspects of mental function and objectively improved participants' ability to post-night shift didactic sessions but was more difficult for them to fall asleep while opportunities for sleep arise. Metametrisms results suggest that modafinill will improve symptoms of hypoglycemia by reducing the release of glutamic neurotransmitters with modalfinil. In this experiment, nine healthy men received two 100-molg dosesof modufinila or placebo followed by an Insulcation Clamp in which plasmaglum was either reduced Stepwise to 2.6 mmol Ooh after eu Glycaemia; four studies. The largest dose produces several sleep changes during the dayshift and other sleep disturbances during night shift. Methalpheni date is shown to have beneficial effects on memory and performance in older adults. It has been reported that it can improve working memory in patients with attention-deficit disorder. However, unlike younger volunteers, no significant effect of drug on work memory is seen. This study investigates the effects of methylpha date on various functions of cognition in elderly healthy subjects. Although there were some side effects, such as abdominal pain, nausea, and headache, these were not found."
29696144,"In this paper, we describe the results of total knee replacement using a posterior bearing type of prosthesis. The patients are compared to those who have other knees and find that the new prostheses perform better than the previous devices. We conclude that there is no difference in the range of motion or pain between the two different types of implants."
27882320,"A standandarded ALE regimen is shown to improve blood lipid levels in otherwise healthy men and women. In the control group, there are no significant differences among groups. The British Heart Study reported that much of its relation to lipoproteincholesterol and risk of coronary disease was eliminated when covariance adjusted. However, this study did not find any significant difference in overall mortality from non-cardiatial causes. This study investigates whether virgin argan oils can reduce the risks of heart disease in healthy Moroccos. Both regimens have similar effects on total cholesterol, low-DLC, high-LDL, and other phospholipid composition. After 8 months, the VAO regimen does not show any changes in either total or LDLcholestrol; however, it does increase the HDL/HDL ratio. Furthermore, Dif1sta ® has been well tolerated for long-term treatment in patients with mild hypercholeremia."
26712512,"The first year of the study results in a weight loss of 4.7 x 5.5 m. v.1. In contrast, the control group loses 3.9 g. per day. This is not surprising since motion-controlling devices have been shown to increase energy expenditure when used to exercise more vigorously. Young adults play three games with either motion or traditional controls. When compared to walking on the bench, young adults' positive well being decreases significantly from preexeduction to postexecure. A comparison of physical activity patterns between older adults with Type 2 diabetes and those without is performed using multiple logistical regression analysis. The mean difference between the two groups was 0.5 mm. There were no significant differences in age or gender among the subjects. However, we carried out post-hocanalyses for the role of leisure time activities in preventing type 2 disease in 487 people and women with impertinent glucose tolerance who completed 12 month LTPA Question naires. After this trial, there were 105 new cases of Type 2, which could be prevented by lifestyle changes. Although these changes are still unclear, they do reduce the risk of developing Type 2."
29320437,"In this paper, we report the results of a large-scale study of premenopanal females from Karachi, Pakistan. We examine the association between 25-hydroxyvinmin D score and changes in fasting blood concentration over 7 years. The predicted value of 25HhD score was associated with an increased increase in Fasting Plasma Glycemic concentration at seven years' follow-up. This is important because it has been shown to be related to long-lived increases in glucose concentration among older adults without Type 2 diabetes. However, there are other risk factors for type 2 disease, including elevated levels of vitamin D. A population-based study on Danish subjects aged 40-70 years showed that patients with low 25OHD were more likely to develop Type 1 disease than those with higher levels. These studies suggest that people with high 25OhD levels may be at greater risk of developing Type 2, especially when they have lower levels"
28718394,"This is a small, well-controlled study that does not provide sufficient evidence for the use or efficacy of either sertraline or placebo in treating patients with coexisting major depressive disorders. In particular, it shows no significant differences in the severity of symptoms between groups. Vilrazdone, an antipsychotic, appears to be more effective than other antidepressants in terms of improving mood and behavior in elderly patients who are also at high risk of developing serious depression. A double- blinded trial comparing vilazogone and nalterxone in severe depressed patients confirms that these two drugs can be used as treatment for moderately to severe depression in adults."
27074871,"In this paper, we describe the results of a large-scale, long-term, i.e., cross-examination study of an intervention for alcoholism in Kenya. We conclude that there are promising efficacy and cost-efficacy benefits from using evidence-based approaches to address both disease and financial burdens. The main aim of the study is to determine whether bicultural para professional health workers can be used as effective treatment for patients with high drinking risk. This trial has been conducted in England and Wales. It was aimed at determining whether methadone combined with brief counseling could be more costeffective than other forms of drug treatment."
28302405,"Elevated concentrations of a certain blood-reactive polypeptide, or ""capitated transforming factor,"" are associated with reduced total and low-densities of both the circulating and inhaled blood. In this study, we examine the effect of elevated levels of the pro-cholester diet on blood pressure. We conclude that increased levels may be beneficial for preventing hypertension by consuming large portions of lean meat."
27530471,"In this study, we examine the effect of a daily dose of magnesium on blood pressure, lipids, and glycemia in Type 2 diabetes patients. The results are similar to those obtained with placebo. A total of 42 patients with Type 1 disease were randomly assigned to receive either 200-mmol/d of elemental glutamine or 300-millimoletric magnesium each day for three months. This trial was designed to evaluate the effects of high-dose magnesium therapy on glucose control and serum concentrations of Hb1c in subjects with type 2 disease."
24577409,"The aim of the study is to determine whether an interdisciplinary community-based exercise program can improve blood pressure in patients with Type 2 hypertension. In this study, we examine the effect that a high-dose multivitamin and mineral combination can reduce the risk of heart disease among elderly Chinese women. After 24 weeks, the patients receive either systelic blood pumping or omsorption treatment. Both groups show significant reductions in blood flow. A controlled intervention study was conducted to evaluate the effects of physical exercises on blood tension control in subjects with pre-hyptertensive conditions. This study included three groups: 1) subjects received general education; 2) subjects attended educational lectures every week; and 3) subjects went walking three times per week. These subjects were divided into four groups according to their age and body size. The most important intervention was for wake stroke bpm which reduced by 5.1mmHg. It also provided motivation for public health strategies that could be adopted through lobbying from the food industryby consumer and health agency. Results At completion of 12 weeks exercise training,the exercise capacity, total cholesterol, trigglycerides, high density Lipoproteincholesterol, P =.001, low Densness lipophosphorylcholorate. Consolation Progressive resistance training reduced SBP/MBP values at rest as well as those of older adults who had been treated with antihysterical medication."
21912106,"After a six-year follow-up period, the incidence of Type 2 diabetes in the Meddiet group is 10.1 p..1 compared with the ADA group and 17 % in favor of the control group. In all three diets, increased consumption of nuts or olive oil was associated with an increased risk of disease. The results of this study suggest that high-mufa diet may be more effective in preventing type 2 disease than conventional low-fat/high-choleric diet regimens."
25855678,"The long-term effects of cabinetilol in the treatment of left-ventricular failure are reported. In this study, patients with severe heart failure were randomized to either irbsartan or placebo for 24 months. There was a significant reduction in risk for death among the two groups. Amlodipin reduced the risk by reducing the frequency of peripheral ear pain and chest pain as well as increasing the severity of hypertension. This study also compared the effect of amloropril on the developmentof atrial fibriliac disease. It was found that adding valsteran to prescribed treatment for HF reduces the rate of newonset occurrence by 37 %). Furthermore, BNP levels and advanced age had been strongest predictors of newly onset arrhythmion. A further analysis of the association between these two factors showed that addition of vascaran would reduce the number of cases of sudden relapse of atrium fibrillation."
28898559,"Sitting for long periods of time compromises metabolic health. Walking, sitting in the car, and sitting on a couch all increase premature mortality risks. A six-month intervention is shown to be particularly effective for people with elevated risk factors at pre-opportune intervals. The current study concludes that this intervention can be extended to include patients with high blood pressure or other riskfactors who have been treated with an activity-monitoring device. In this paper, we examine the effect of total hip resurfacing on patients' actual physical activity, pain, stiffness, ability to perform tasks, as well as self-representation of physical function. We find that these changes are modest but significant."
26885157,"In this study, we compare the wear of alumina bearings with those of conventional polyethylene. The results are similar: at least one bearing replaces only 12 hips in the trial group; there is no difference in mid-term outcome between groups. At follow-up, the mean wear rate for both bearing types is reduced by almost threefold. We conclude that the new material performs as well as any conventional bearing in relation to functional hip scores, radiographic miolysis, complications, and survival. A prospective multi-centre trial compares the performance of two bearing surfaces on patients with Osteoartritis. Both bearing systems have improved knee function over time. However, they do not show significant differences in pain or function after five years."
23744449,"Anemic children come from families with less maternal education and more support for child growth and are less likely to receive breastfed. Iron deficient anemia is associated with poor motor and mental development in these infants, but no significant differences are found between the two groups in birth history, socioeconomic status, or general nutrition which might otherwise explanation the lower developmental tests scores ofthe anecdote babies. The Central Conduction Time test score is a measure of central nervous system development because Myelinations of nerve fiber's and maturing of synaptically relays leadto an exponential reduction on the central conduction times from birth to 12 mo. In this study, iron treatment improves language performance by 0.8 points on 20 point scales. A doubleblind placebo-control cohort of 196 pre-primanded infant girls aged 6-18 months was used to assess the effect of iron intervention on iron status; anaemia, growth, Morbidity, and development were measured. After three months of treatment, both results were improved. Children with iron depleted aniemia had significantly lower mental/ motor scores than controls or nonanenmic iron-destained infant classes. Before intervention, the mean mentally and motor Scores of the iron despised anestemia group were significantly reduced than those of other irondeficient class. This association may be related either to irreversible behavior or to some adverse environment that may have led to their delayed development."
26507525,"In this paper, we present a novel approach to the evaluation of minimally-incisioned total knee surgery. We compare the results of two different surgical approaches: 1) using an electric navigation system to guide the patient through the incision; and 2) using conventional knee arthrostomies with traditional guides. This new approach has great potential for improving both patient outcomes and long-term follow up. The study concludes that there are no significant differences between the clinical and laboratory-resemblance between these two groups. For example, patients who underwent the guided technique had shorter operative times and shorter inpatient stays than those who were not guided."
32260482,"This paper focuses on the flaws of the trial design, conduct, analysis, and reporting. It uses a novel approach to assess risk of bias by comparing the effects of two different drugs on salivary secretion. In borderline hyperthyroid subjects, propranolel and hyptolamine do not improve saliva secretions while atropine causes them to decrease. Both groups of subjects have similar blood levels of catecholamine. The results suggest that in both groups are paralyzed with hypotensive disease. Intravennous infusionses of nescintine lead to recurrent increases in saliva flow."
26560173,"A brisk study of 29 patients with seasonal affective disease who had relapsed from bipolar disorder showed that light therapy was an effective treatment for their condition. In this paper, Agomelatina is shown to be as effective as sertraline in treating the disease. It also has a positive effect on sleep and mood. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of light-sensation on the behavior of depressed patients. This study compares two different forms of sunlight: bright white light and infrarotonin light. Both are more efficacious than the control conditions."
23660970,"In this paper, we describe the effects of methylphini date on brain function in children with hyperactivity disorder. Specifically, our study uses positron-emission tomography assay to determine whether or not methylphenis date alters extracellular dopamine levels in the brain. The results suggest that a drug such as Methmylphenidate may be more effective in treating attention-diffit/hypteractivity disorders than other treatment regimens. We use functional magnetic resonance images to investigate the effect of single dose MPH on delayed temporal processing in ADHD patients. Brain activations are improved when combined with medication and community care. For example, during an interruption task, boys with both drugs show reduced brain activity in fronto-sternal regions but improved performance under either condition. This review also provides evidence for the importance of childhood early recognition of mental health problems among adults with and without symptoms of ADHD. A case-control study is performed to estimate the prevalence of psychological pathology in youth who have been treated by adult psychiatrists before they reach adulthood."
17943920,"A prospective, uncontrolled study evaluating the effects of six weekly sessions of floating spa therapy on patients suffering from Ostearthritis. All patients improved for a duration of three months. The results were similar to those reported in other studies. In addition, there was no significant change in pain or quality of life after treatment. This study is an attempt to determine the effect of combined spa exercise and physical therapy with drugs and daily group physical exercises on subjects with pSoriais. It was found that both groups showed improvement in symptoms but that they did not show any changes in overall well-being."
22331380,"In this study, we examine the effects of a high-fructosce diet on blood lipid changes and on insulinsensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that consumption of low-carbohydrate foods may be associated with reduced risk of developing Type 2 hypertension."
24897375,"In this paper, we describe the use of real-time polymorphism to predict Clostridial difficile relapses in patients with severe disease. The results of this study suggest that treatment with monoclonic anti-diarrhaea antibodies reduces the risk of developing serious complications among these patients. We also present a prospective case-control trial using two different approaches: 1) PCR and 2) EIA or C.C. assays. A significant difference in the severity of disease was found between cases detected by either method and those who were treated with fidaXomicin or vancoicillin. This suggests that it is possible for physicians to improve inter-hospital comparisons of diagnoses made by both methods. However, there are still some unreliable predictors regarding the extent of the disease's course. For example, one patient has recurring Clostidium difficile disease after receiving metirondazole; other patients have only PPI treatment. These patients may be more likely to get cured than those without such treatment because of their greater suspense over time."
24549404,"The results of this study suggest that the use of a modified version of the GPR exercise regimen can be used to treat patients suffering from asspondylite. In addition, it has been reported that there is significant improvement in joint mobility and functional capacity in both groups. This paper also reports on the effect of group exercise on pain and quality-of-life in patients with acute ankyloping s Pondylitis. It concludes that home-based physical therapy may be more successful than individualized exercises in improving these conditions."
25510863,"In this study, we examine the effects of a combination of physical exercise, salt reduction, and meditation on patients with high-risk coronary disease. We conclude that these treatments are more effective than either of these approaches in reducing risk or improving symptoms. The authors review the evidence for the benefits of both types of intervention. They suggest that they should be used as stand-alone treatment rather than as part of an overall lifestyle change."
29169245,"In this single-blind, randomed controlled trial, 30 adults who had been admitted from rehabilitation to independence in the community were compared with those who received usual care. The majority of them were White, was widowized, and had high school education. No group differences were found for selfefficacy nor outcome expectations. This is part of Trondheim's hip fracture trial where we compare free-living physically behavior in daily living 4 and 12 month following hip surgeryfor patients managed with Comprehensive Geriatric Care. In upright time at four months was 34.9 min / 17.4 %) CI 9.06 to 59 6 ; p =.007, but at 12 months 27.7min /13.9 % P = 5.001 "
15846636,"The effect of a six-week intervention on patients with medical conditions who have not yet been shown to be at risk for psychological disturbances was examined. In the intervention group, patients reported improved physical symptoms and less pain than the controls. After six months, the patients' scores on depression, anxiety, and general health questions were significantly higher in the treatment group than that of the control group. This study furthermore examines the efficacy of short-term hypnosis as an intervention for patients suffering from irritablebowel syndrome. It is concluded that this treatment has significant relapsing behavior and does not cause substitution symptoms."
30371517,"This is a prospective, observational study of patients with chronic back pain who receive multiple-disciplined treatment. In the intervention group, there are significant improvements in self-efficacy, pain intensity, and other measures of function at the endof the program. The results suggest that multidisciplinary therapy may be more effective than st or ard medical treatment for patients suffering from chronic shoulder pain."
30667278,"A six-month telephone coach program is used to train patients in the use of a risk-factor-based approach to improving their health. In this study, we examine the effects of an eight-week exercise program on changes in blood pressure, body massindex, and physical activity among patients with Type 2 diabetes who are not attending regular medical care. We conclude that this intervention does not lead to improved health or quality of life for these patients. Two single-centre rand and omolized controlled pilot studies were conducted to determine the impact of message reminders after 12 months on medication adherence Over usual care; P.000, 95 percent CI 7-16 21. This trial was followed by two further trials: one designed to assess the effect of phone-delivering lifestyle management on cardiovascular risk factor reduction over 12 month intervals. The results showed no significant difference between the control group and the intervention group. Both groups reported improvements in heart function at 6 months' follow-up. Another study examined the effectiveness of ""telephony-deviced secondary prevention"" programs in patients suffering from acute coronary disease following discharge from the hospital. It found that there was little improvement in patient satisfaction during the first three months of the program. However, it did improve weight loss in both groups. Finally, the authors report that they have developed an alternative method of providing risk factors management training and risk assessment services to patients living with chronic heart disease."
31152444,"A consensus meeting of bipolar physicians has recommended the use of lithium as a first-line treatment for patients with severe manic symptoms. The results of this study indicate that both drugs are effective in treating mildly active men with acute mania. In addition, it is reported that mixed affective states can predict relapses and that there is sensitivity to drug effects on severity. Lithiium Carbonate appears to be more effective when compared against chlorpromazin in terms of time to response or changes in severity of illness. Two other studies suggest that lamotrigines may be superior to either type of drug in improving patient psychiatry. These studies conclude that ""lithium"" seems to have an advantageous effect on the treatment of severely ill patients who meet rigorous criteria for Bipolar disorder."
20189946,"In this study, we examine whether the beneficial effects of atrial pacering are maintained during follow up of up to eight years. After a mean repeat-up of three years, atrium pacing appears to be associated with less atartificial events and heart failure in patients with sicksinus disease. A previous study found that after an extended follow-on of 3.2 years there was no difference in mortality or heart fail among the two groups. Atorvalstatin treatment reduces the rate of acute high-rate events by reducing the risk of fatal stroke as compared to placebo. The main end point for the study was death from anything or notfatal stroke. However, it is uncertain which type of surgery results in better outcome. Most of stored achres were symptomatic; symptoms do not correspond to actual AHre in most patients. There was only one primary endpoint: time to persistentatrial fibrillations. Both groups had similar rates of mortality. They also showed significant improvement in the duration of the interval between the first and second post-opportunity. This was due to the increased frequency of device-based attrition."
25803266,"Sweet Talk is a new type of self-management system that uses short messages to improve blood pressure in Type 1 patients. In this study, we examine the effect of using short message service on patient adherence and change in blood glucose levels over solitary time. We conclude that it is possible to use short communication services for improved health outcomes. A pilot study was conducted whereby physicians led remote telemedicical management was compared with conventional care. The results were that there was no significant improvement in quality of live from baseline to follow-up. This study also examined whether physician-led remote medical management would result in reduction of mortality in hambroken patients with chronic Heart failure. It was found that the intervention group received better control of heart failure than the control group. Furthermore, the cell phone-retrieval program improved Hb1c by improving both diet and exercise. AsthmA's disease continues to be an important issue in the United States as well as in Africa."
12695268,"In this study, we examine the relative safety of acetaminol and dipropriety in the treatment of patients with acute or chronic atrial fillation. Amiomedarone seems to be more effective but has more side effects than digoxin. Ninety five patients were rand-omized for either amiostinide or placebo during four weeks. The results showed that all patients converted to normal heartbeats after an average time of 35.4 months. Dofetilide seemed to improve these results by increasing the success rate on electric cardioversion and decreasing the number of repeat occurrences. A double blinded, open-labeled trial was undertaken to compare efficacy between sotalolic and amide in conversion of recent-onset paroxymal atrium fibrillation into normal sinus rhythm. After two late conversions upon placebo, there was no significant reduction in time to convert to sinus rythme. Adverse events were not different among the three groups; however, they were similar in terms of adverse events."
24018611,"This study focuses on the effects of an operant behavior therapy and a sleep-hysteria education program for patients with fms. The results indicate that both treatment groups are effective in improving pain intensity, function, and quality of living. A second trial is designed to examine whether psychological treatments are more effective when compared to medical care. In this case, there is no difference in pain severity or functional status at followup. However, it does show that CBT is superior to other forms of treatment. Another study compares self-regarding sleep problems with risk of musculonoskeletal pain in adult women. It also shows that exercise and physical activity are beneficial for women who have fibromyalsgiA."
27788565,"In this paper, the authors examine the effect of a maternal dietary intervention with fish oil on infants at elevated risk of allergic disease. They conclude that it does not prevent childhood asthma or sensitization but improves growth and health. The study also determines whether feeding preterm babies with long chain polynsaturated fats will improve brain and vision development. A doubleblind, rand-omized control trial has been conducted in which pregnant women receive daily doses of 1200 milligrams per day of Dha, 801 mg/mL arachidic acid, or 600 millg DHA from birth until age 6 months. There is no relationship between blood levels of TGF1, and albumin, blood uresa nitrogen, and body mass index among these groups. However, there are no differences in weight gain or body composition between the two groups: lean and fat Mass corrected for height were measured by skinfold thickes and ultrasonogram. This study furthermore investigates the impact of short-chain Polyunsulated Fatty acids on post-pregnancy growth. It was found that breast milk had less than one-third of total phospholipid content; however, when fed with longer chains of polyunstastained fatty acids, they did not change their contents. Furthermore, early enteral feeding increased the exposure to intravenous lipids, increased Enroute intake, reduced conjugated Bilirubin after reanstomosis, improved weight gained and length gain before reassuring entry into an Enterostomy. These results suggest that feeding prematurely-fed infant formulas with high-Dha algal oil may have some beneficial effects on immune function."
19398930,"The aim of this study is to determine the effect of lactic acidose on patients who have previously received conventional treatment for their malignancies. In this paper, we describe the use of Lactobacterus rhumnosus as a second-line therapy for patients with acute or chronic bowel disease. We conclude that it is superior to placebo in terms of tolerability and quality of patient population."
28455363,"A prospective cohort study of patients with mtbi who have recovered within one month of injury is performed. The results suggest that the severity of the injury can be predicted by symptoms and blood flow, but there is little evidence for this prediction. In addition, it is unclear whether concusses are associated with delayed recovery or disease-like changes in brain function. This study consists of a pre-season follow-up study to determine the extent of recovery among concsed players after an acute bout of head injury."
26508743,"A randomized, double-blind study comparing the effects of two diets on blood pressure and lipoprotein concentrations in patients with Type 2 who are not at risk for heart disease.

27019254,"The Cr group shows a significant increase in serum crizonium compared to that of the placebo group. The aim is to determine the effects of chromium on blood glucose, insulin-sensitivity, and bloodmarks of ""oxidative stress"" in persons with Type 2 Diabetes mellitateus. Forty six subjects were given 200 g Cr as cr-enriched yeast or placebo for 12 weeks. No differences were found between the intervention groups; nor were there any differences among the groups for their secondary end points. Thirteen patients were treated with 400 pg Cre-Enriched yeast over 12 days. In this study, no changes were observed in A1c but no change was found for other endpoints such as body weight, blood pressure, lipoprotein, etc. This study investigates the efficacy of chlormium-based treatment on fasting bloodglucose levels in type 2 diabetic patients. It was reported that it improved both HbA1 C and lipid profiles in newly onset patients who were receiving hypoglyciemic agents."
25350225,"The efficacy, safety, and long- term tolerability are demonstrated in this study of patients with lower Ury tract symptoms suggestive of Benign Prostatic hyperplusa. A total sample of 2474 patients from several centers was recruited to the trial. After eight weeks of treatment, IPss improved significantly. All the individuals were satisfied and almost all were dissatised with low- dose tam'sin. The purpose is to evaluate the Long-Term efficiacy and safety for dramsulosol in patients who have lower urinary Tract symptoms suggesting prostatic hypoplasia in China. From April 1994 until July 1995, 113 patients received either brahmin or alpha 1 blocker treatments. Both groups showed significant improvements in the American Urological association symptom score, quality of life, peak urine flow rate, Qmax at 6 months. In addition, both groups produced significant improvement in their mean change in each item except urgency, storage, etc. At 12 weeks, six items of Uritic Trestick symptoms except urgent, Storage and voidling symptoms, total Uritative Score, Quality of Life Index, Questionmax, Postvoid Resent Urinary Volume and Sexual Function were improved greatly. Men complaining about lower Urintry Trrest symptoms due to BPH were divided into three groups: one receiving fiftymg hysterol once daily, Naf group; another receiving 0.2m Hysterical Tenderized tablet twice daily. There was no difference in Clinicalefficacy between NaF and Tam in terms of improving retro grade evacuation. However, there was a significant increase in retrograde escortations after intermittent TTamsulphosis treatment. This prospect also iv r and Omized controlled studies was performed on Japanese patients suffering from benign prostacia.

Adverse reactions may or probably relate to study medication which were possibly related during the treatment period. To compare the effect of an incremental dose regimen of tersely soliloquy/terazosine against recurrent fixed-dose regimens of bummerous drugs such as nafartopidil, but these trials did not result in any adverse events. They included men with moderate prostate volume greater than 35 mL. Selected"
19221376,"Cost-effectiveness is compared between the cost of statins and the expected long-term benefits of treatment for patients with high risk of heart disease. The results suggest that pravastain may be more cost effective than other anti-angioplasty drugs in terms of improved survival and quality of life. In addition, it is more favorable for older age groups who have lower risks of artery disease because they are younger and less likely to experience major vascular events."

20927745,"The Early Intervention Trial a) evaluates the safety and efficiacy of fiatsteride in patients with early benign prostatichypoplasia. In this study, we report on the reduction in urinary volume and symptoms as well as the improvement in the mean Urinary Score score from baseline to final point. We also describe the long- term safety results of treatment with 5mg finasterde in two studies of patients who have symptomatic Benign Prostatic hyperplusa: A sub-plot analysis shows that there is no significant difference in residual volume between the placebo group and the treated group; however, both groups show improvements in symptoms. This paper concludes by examining the effects of five-alpha-Reductasing inhibitor Finaste on men with benignprostatic hypoplasa -- known as BPH. It has been shown that it can reduce the risk of surgical intervention for those with enlarged or diseased prostates."
23790149,"In this study, we examine the effects of a Mediterranean style diet on blood lipid levels and risk of Type 2 diabetes in overweight patients. The results are very similar to those seen in the American Diabetes Association's intervention trial. We conclude that the Mediterranean diet is more effective than the conventional approach because it reduces both total and low-dentalcholesterol levels as well as improves fasting blood sugar levels. This paper also discusses several other possible approaches to preventing type 2 disease, including multiple lifestyle changes. For example, an indo-mediterraneal diet may be more successful in reducing body weight for obese women with premenopause."
20099019,"The present study demonstrates that homeopathy is superior to placebo in improving tender point pain, quality of life, mood, and overall health of people with a fibromyallygia condition. Forty-three patients completed the treatment regimen. There were few adverse events reported; however, there was primarily reluctance to participate in an extended trial because of the high risk of false positive results. In addition, prefrontal electrodes are associated with improved function in patients with fibromyal GIa."
26122377,"In this paper, the authors present a five-year study of two different types of restorative materials in Class I teeth. The results of the study indicate that there are no significant differences in performance between the two types; however, they do note that size of restoration has an effect on patient sensitivity. A comparison of three different resin composites is made: Solitaire I, which uses selfetching and totaletch to bond dentin together; Ariston pHC, used to restore Class II teeth; and Packable Composites, intended for use in split-mouthed patients. Although some studies have suggested that split mouth design may lead to greater inter-individually variability in the effects of treatment, these studies suggest that it does not."
28490031,"In this paper, we describe a double blinded, multi-centre study of bupropion and veto over the efficaciousness of two different drugs for treating depressed patients. Buproppion is more effective than Venlafaxine in terms of tolerability and sexual function. The change scores differ significantly between groups at week 2 on toward treatment. A total number of 348 female outpatients with depression were assigned to receive either buprapion Xl or vainlafine xr. After 12 weeks of treatment, they were terminated. Both treatments were well tolerated; however, their side effects were greater than those of other antidepressers. Brofarome was superior to both placebo and the Hamilton Depression Score, which measures severity of depression. Two studies have examined the consistency of each scale as an instrument for evaluating depression severity. One has found that the HDS does not apply to the patient's individual condition but only applies to one patient. Another study compares the effectiveness of imipramin and celoppramine in major depression by comparing the performance of sertralini and cognitive-behavior group therapy in subjects with mild Major Depressive disorder. This study concludes that gepirone extend release may be better than paroxene when compared to serotoniin re uptake inhibitors. Sertraline 50mg once daily is equally effective as higher doses during the treatment of minor depression with few sideeffects and therapy discontinuation. Meditate Outcomes: There were no significant difference in scores between desvenla Fabrinine or placebo after 6 months"

Although there is no evidence for an up-regulf in appetite during this type of play, it does suggest that motion-controlled games may be able to improve energy expenditures. The results of this study are reported in the journal of the American College of Physicians as NCT0210246. In contrast, the profiles found in glucose, insulin, cortissol, and Ghrelin do not seem to suggest an increase in hunger during the game-play condition. However, there are few reports of these studies because of their high internal validity."
29733052,"This study compares the efficacy of a stand-alone intervention to resuming work in emotionally distressed patients. The results suggest that both groups have returned to the labor market within one year, but there is no difference in the severity of their symptoms. In this case, emotional distress is associated with higher costs and reduced productivity. A multi-disciplined sample of employers from three different industries responds to an organization's questionnaire about eight occupational disability management practices. Results indicate that for patients with mental disorders, better health, work ability, and positive expectation of return to work are related to returning to working. For patients who receive combined treatment, returns to regular work faster than those who only receive clinical intervention."
29767225,"The results of a 10-week exercise program for balance improve older adults. In the intervention group, balance tests showed significant improvement in both static and Dynamometric balance. This study also examines the association between post-operative complications and death in patients with fractured hips. A control group consisted of sixty-six elderly women who had been assigned to one of two groups: the ""Integration,"" or the Control -- without intervention; and the other group consisting of sixty females who were not assigned any of the usual suspects such as age, gender, physical condition, or health status. These subjects completed their follow-up visits from 2000 until 2002 and were then followed for 9 years. After this initial period of follow up, the treatment group did not show any change in either stability or fall risk factors. However, after confounding factor has been controlled for, it was found that the exercise group performed significantly better in all three outcome measures."
28042114,"In this paper, the senior authors independently begin using an enhanced posterior soft tissues repair for total hip replacement. The first author's experience is that a dislocation rate was reduced in three95 patients before the enhanced closed procedure; in the second author and experience, 160 total joints had remained unreopened after the improved closure. This results are highly significant: revision for osteolysis or wear and asepticloosing were as frequently in dm-tha as in fist-arthroplasty. A new technique called ""dual-mobility"" seems to reduce the risk of unstable instability following primary total knee replacement by reducing the need for additional loosening during the initial stage of the surgery. These studies aim to evaluate the outcomes of 61 different revisions with AOOS grades III and IV bone defect reconstructing using kerboull cross plate, structural allostograft, and cemented double mobility cup. At 7.5 years follow-up, no instability reported after revision. Furthermore, such reconstitution technique demonstrated excellent success at mid- term follow up in terms of preventive instability after revising, restoration ofthe acetabulary bone stock,and stable Cemented Fixation of both dual mobility cups Dislocation is one of those leading causes of revision after complete hip arthrostry. After implantation of Poliarcup Dual Mobility Cup, surgeons performed 78 consecutive patient-revisions without any complications. They concluded that there was no difference between the outcome of two groups of isolated ACEtabular revision procedures. Two hundred and 14 hips in nineteen patients were included. Unlabelled The outcome showed that the use of single design of duo-motion cup reduced the risks of dislocation from 2 to 6 years. Level of evidence Level I / Therapeutic study No patients have progressive Ostelysis, Component Migration & looseening on radioographs. Three types of situationsat risk : St. and ardrisk ; Medium risk -- 37 cases if recurrent stability occurs; medium risk = 21 cases when periprostesthetic fracture has occurred; and Mean interval between Index surgery and revisionwas 12.9 years When revision surgery became necessary, average hospital costs increased from 148 p.m. to 92 % of overall cost of an unscomplicated full hip replacement.

16606807,"In this double blinded, multi-centre, placebocontrolled study, Dofetileide was moderately effective at cardioverting atrial fillation to syphilis and significantly effective for maintaining SR. After 1 year follow-up, 22 patients had at least one recurrance of symptomatical atrium fibrillation in either group. The efficacies and long- term tolerability were determined; an estimated 79.5 % of fledcainide against 55.4 %) of quinine patients would remain successfully treated at the conclusion of1 year on therapy. A prospective, single-blind trial compares the efficacious and safety of flecahinide aquetum or quinchidine when used for treatment of atary fibrilation. For the first six months, however, there was significant side effects. Thus, more patients should continue longterm therapy with furcaenone than with sotallol. Two studies have been performed: one concerning the use of proparotic drugs for prevention of arrhythmies after medical or electric cardioversion; another concerning propaftenone's ability to maintain sinus rhythm after congesive heart failure. These studies are followed by two further studies that evaluate the effectiveness of antiarrhythmically agents such as metoprololil and digoxiniz. They conclude that these agents are safe and increase the probability of attaining and maintaining sinus rythme in patients withstructural heart disease."
30945127,"This paper presents a method for calculating health utility scores from the Children's Questionnaire-C30, an instrument used to assess health-related qualities of life. The results of this method are compared with that of other methods, such as standard logistic regression and Bayesian approaches. In addition, it is shown that the best model predicts better health state utility measures than the most accurate models. It is further presented that in order to reduce the burden on multiple measures being collected, we developed an appropriate mathematical technique called Ordinal logistic Regression using Monte Carlo Simulation. Mapping from disease-respected quality oflife onto generic preferencebased measures is now common when health status utility values are un directly available for economy evaluation. A comparison of three different modeling techniques was performed: 1) average least squares, 2) generalized linear map, and 3) fractional regression. These were tested in terms of mean absolute error, root meansquared error; and finally, they were validated by cross sectional surveys."
11034761,"In this study, we investigate the effects of IVK-II on newborns. We find that VK is more effective than either orally or Intruscularly at preventing bleeding in infants who have low levels of vitamin K. The results support the view to use VIK as prophylaxes at birth will aid to prevent premature bleeding. A new mixed mousellar preparation with lecitchin and glycochol acid was prepared during the first eight weeks of life for breastfed infant girls. By 14days only one infant had a raise PIVka II value; both of these initial values were high concentrations in cord blood. Prothromin time, prothrompin time/irrational blood samples were collected at 24 h, 4 days, and 24 hours of age. At two weeks old, no significant differences were observed between the groups: no cases of bleeding; no changes in all the biological markers. No significant difference between any of the Biochemical Markers are observed. After 48 and before72 hours after delivery, patients were randomed to the same dosage as an Intrmuscular Injection. There was no apparent difference in other biochemical markers except for the combined activity of protection factor II+VII + X. All babies were given 1mg of peroral Vitamin K but no impregnating factor. Both groups showed no signs of deficion. They also did not show any change in their blood coagulation activities. Their basal activity was similar among the two groups. These results suggest that Oral Vk effectively increases Volcanic dependent factors while preventing the risk of severe hemorrhac disease in young infant"
30293909,"In this study, we examine the effect of high-doses of vitaminD on bone mineral denition in patients with heart failure. The results suggest that higher doses may be more effective than placebo in improving lower leg function. A double blind trial is performed to determine whether increased daily dosages can prevent fractures in elderly people living in an institution. This trial uses a pooled randomised control design and does not result in any significant differences in changes in bone mass or bone turnover over two years. However, there are no significant changes among the three groups: one group has greater improvement in knee pain scores; another has only slight improvements in total body BMI. Another study compares the effects of four-monthally 1,000 iu/day of Vitamin D1 against 3,000 IU per week for reduction in hip fracture risk. These results indicate that long-term use of these drugs may reduce falls but do not improve overall health."
31021537,"In this study, a dose of 10mg./kg of tociliumab is given to patients with severe idoopathic arthritis who have an inadequate response for disease-modifying drugs. After two weeks of treatment, the patients are able to return to their normal behavior. Acute rash occurs in one case of abdominal pain and bronchophomonia or gastroenteitis. The most commonly reported adverse events are: upper respiratory tract infections; pharynagitus; gastroentitities; and asthma. Abatacept was previously used in children with ""insufficient response to diseasemodification"" but has not been shown to be as efficacious as other agents. This trial compares abatacib with tame acetonics in juvenile arthorid arthritis. Both groups show significant improvement in terms of pain, stiffness, and fatigue."
31334564,"This paper focuses on the effects that rest breaks and physical exercises have on workers' symptoms. The results of this study suggest that work breaks can be used to reduce stress and improve performance without prolonging the operation time. In addition, it shows that patients with wrist pain who are not treated for de Quervain's  Tenosynomitis receive no significant changes in their shoulder postures during prolonged work sessions. A worksite preventment program was developed to improve the healthy lives of construction employees. At six months after the intervention, the control groups reported a slight reduction of physical fatigue but no change in quality of life. Workers were also found to report improved self-repressed recovery when they took regular breaks. Neck and shoulders complaints were investigated among office workers. They showed no improvement in health or well being at the larger working site. Short break periods were more effective than conventional ones because they reduced sitting by an average amount of 21 minutes per day. There was some evidence that point-ofchoice prompting could help reduce long hours of sitting. However, these studies did not lead to improvements in worker health."
28027041,"A pretest-posttest experimental design was used to determine whether the combination of Pydastigmine and supervised exercise yielded significant improvement in most patients with affluent gynia. The results were as follows: pain severity, fatigue, poor sleep, stiffness, and anxiety improved; quality of life increased, physical fitness improved, health care utilizattion improved more than did writing. In addition, written emotional disclosure led to greater reductions in both local and national impact. This study examined the effects of ""functional interactivity"" on health outcomes in patients who had fibromyalsgiA. It was found that knowledge positively affects health outcome but that empowerment dimension of meaning and impact also significantly affected health consequences. However, knowledge negatively affected overall health endpoints. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in pain scores at week 12 or week 24 between the control group and the intervention group. Measurres This rand and Omized controlled trials evaluated an innovation affective self awareness -- ASA -- which was designed to reduce pain/improve function in individuals with feverishly malformed grotesque musculosities. At three months' follow up there is pronounced improvement for the treatment group in terms of functional capacity, pain, depression, mental health, etc."

31856249,"In this study, we examine the association between childhood syphilis and adult-onset physical conditions in a cross-sectional sample of adults from 10 countries. We find that there is an association with all six of these conditions when young people are 20 years old. Adoleescents in high and stable classes have higher anxiety than those in low and increasing classes. This study also examines whether social support can reduce blood pressure during an acute event. When youth are 18 years older, they assess peer emotional support. There is no evidence that psychological stress may interfere with the effects of social supports on blood flow. The results suggest that if young men receive more social help at an early age, their risk for heart disease will be increased."
28393328,"In this cross sectional study, we aim to investigate potential association between objectively measured physical activities and depression among a national representative sample of U.S. older adults. For every 60 minutes increase in lightening physical activity, participants were twenty-five percent less likely to become depressed. The results suggest that exercise is more effective than other forms of exercise for reducing the risk of heart attack and mortality. A high-volume activity regimen reduces the burden of insulin resistance but does not lead to significant changes in body weight or fat mass. Furthermore, there is no significant relationship between exercise intensity and amount of time spent walking. This suggests that it may be necessary for greater weight loss when exercise increases blood sugar levels."
28752873,"In this study, we examine the effects of a low-sugar diet on plasma lipids and alpha-Linoleonic acid levels. The results suggest that high-launted fats may be more beneficial in terms of atherogenesis than low L-Aids because they are associated with reduced blood coagulations. We also investigate the effect of fish oil on heart disease by comparing it to ALA or linOleic acid. This study concludes that overeating fatty acids promotes lean tissue but excess energy from them may increase liver fat. A doubleblind, parallel- group, rand and ommized trial was conducted whereby subjects were assigned to either 15 g of flax seed oil rich in Allucent Acid or 15ml of Safflower Oil per day. Both treatments did not affect serum total cholesterol, Triglycerides, high dentility lipoproteincholesteride, low Dentition Lipophospholipidcholate, antagonizing Protein A, anti-atheogenaetic chemicals, fibrinnet, and other markers. No significant changes were found in any other hae mostatic variables. These studies provide further evidence for the efficacy of these different types of fat as potential risk reduction strategies."

In this study, the effects of daily ricota cheese on muscle mass, strength, and physical function are examined in elderly subjects. Although there is no significant change in body composition or muscle size between groups, it is suggested that adding 210g of cottage cheese daily may improve these results."
31749717,"The aim of the present study is to determine whether a new form of childbirth in Saudi Arabia would be more cost effective. In this pilot, patients who have been treated with serotonine norepinophrine for three months are shown to improve on their symptoms afterward. They do not show any changes in their function or behavior during this time period. However, many patients fail to respond to treatment and dropout from the trials. This first trial provides preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of duloxenetine as an antidepressant in treating posttraumatic anxiety disorder. A double blinded, placebo-control study was designed to assess the effect of Duloxeten on depression severity and functional improvement among patients with severe mental illness. Although there were side effects, these included constipation, nausea, dry mouth, and sleep disturbances. After two weeks of treatment, all patients showed improved scores on the Hamilton Depression Score and reduced self-rated functions. These results suggest that duplexet may be useful for treating patients suffering from obsesive compulsives."
18457601,"In this paper, we examine the relationship between maternal demographic and behavior characteristics with these measures. Women who are unaware of the ""correct message"" about folate consumption are more likely to eat fortified food than women who have not been told about the correct message. We conclude that there is no association between these two strategies. Furthermore, it was found that women were less interested in pre-conceceptional advice from their general physician when they were pregnant. This study furthermore investigates the interest of females aged 18-40 in receiving preconceptionary advice on folic acid. The results of an independent cross sectional follow up survey indicate that most women had heard of foline but only a small amount had known of its benefits. However, many women reported that they could use folicacide daily to prevent birth defects. After the initial intervention, 38 p.g. physicians and 38 percent of pharmacists recommended prophylaxes as compared with 75 % and 43 pp.n.e.d. They concluded that the effect of Prophylusis was small. A more structured approach including officebased protocol would be needed"

The results indicate that the two groups have different onset and duration of cold illnesses, but they do not show any difference in severity or duration. In addition, the group has a lower rate of sick call visits or treatment days. This study does not support the efficacism of this type of treatment; however, it does suggest that there may be some benefit in using these regimens for patients with acute respiratory infection."
22161375,"Antithrombotic treatment reduces the overall mortality of women from 31 to 15 p.m., especially those 55 years old or over with moderately serious infa-rct""ion. In addition, there is no significant reduction in risk of death or major bleeding among patients treated with either aspirin nor warfarin. The effect of long-term antithrobolic therapy on blood pressure was described in this paper. After acute myomyocardials in fist ionic attacks, it was found that an extended regimen of aspidin and war farin could be more effective at preventing these events. A double blinded placebo-controlled trial examined the effects of two different anti-inflammatory agents: sulindacac and nanbumetone. Both drugs showed marked improvement in their ability to prevent stroke; however, they did not lead to any significant change in the severity of disease. This study also included a sub-study of the first Stroke Prevention Study. It concluded that although some patients may benefit from antiplatelet treatments, such as dipyridalmole, other patients do not."
30498820,"In this study, we examine the effects of a specific type of exercise on body composition, blood components, and physical performance in elderly Japanese women who are sarcophobic. The bimagrumamab treatment results in significant improvements in muscle strength, fat mass, weight loss, as well as improvement in quality of life. We also report that patients with severe scaropenia exhibit lower baseline peak torque and MQ than those with placebo. A multi-centre, doubleblind, controlled trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy for progressive resistance exercise training in older people. It has been reported that it can increase muscle mass and improve health in frail old women. This study compares the ability of four different methods to predict future physical limitation: walking speed, standing from heave, climbing stairs, or sitting at home."
28057512,"This is a random-controlled, t-blind, single-arm study of the effects of walking on people with intellectual and other physical challenges. The results show that there are no significant differences between group groups in percentage time spent walking per day, percent time in moderate- vigorous physical activity, body massindex, or subjective well being. In addition, there was no difference in time for either group to complete their exercise program. There were only minor differences in minutes of walk/bimmy measured by accelerometers. A mixed-effects model was used to predict whether walking would be an effective intervention for adults with learning difficulties."
19491064,"The aim of this study is to determine whether or not a single daily dose of vitamin D can improve the outcome of tuberculotic patients. A double blinded rand and Omized control trial was conducted on 192 healthy adults who had been admitted to the hospital in London, United Kingdom. There were more men than females; 78.7% were in theproductive age group; 71.6 %) had low nutrition status; 62.4 / % had high education level; and 67.2 with low income. This study compares the effect of two different forms of treatment: 1) multivitamin-mineral 2) zinc 3) supplementation. In terms of patient improvement, there was no significant difference between the weight gain at seven months and the relative risk of death from both groups. Conclusions Ongoing follow up will assess the long-term effects of these intervention. For tubersculosus patients, daily consumption of calcium plus vitaminD did not have any effect on the rate of colorecent tumors among postmenophausal women. Both groups showed improved bone mineral denition after 12 weeks of their respective treatments. They also found no differences in duration or severity for uric symptoms during winter."
27528494,"In order to investigate the association between maternal and child death in 154 different countries, we use a mixed-line regression model. The results are concordant, yielding an effect estimate with overlapping95 p.c. confidence intervals across different analytical approaches. There is often considerable uncertainty about the impact of health system or policy interventions. One distinguish over-evalation/up-coded and under-coding of the casemix. This paper uses multiple methods to examine the effects of an educational session on patients' attitudes and behavior. A controlled intervention was performed on paediatric patients and two48 controls. After comparing the results of previous studies, this paper concludes that there is no significant difference in the rate of out of hospital Mortality, Re-Admission, and Physician satisfaction after discharge. It also discusses the use of fraud detection services in pharmacy communities as well as the effectiveness of these services."
29018489,"In this paper, we report the results of a single-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which resversatrol was found to improve blood glucose and insulin resistance in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The primary outcome measures were changes in body weight, blood pressure, and other parameters. After six months, the mean change from control group to intervention group was almost identical. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups. This study further investigates the effects of three different dosages of Resveratro on various aspects of patient's health: fasting blood sugar, Insulin resistance, homeostassium model assessment of Insulinemic-Euglycationic Clamp technique. These results suggest that either regimen may be useful for improving both patient symptoms and overall health."
30324177,"In this paper, we describe a novel approach to pain management that uses an evidence-based model of pain and function. We examine the effect of sleep disturbances on pain outcome in children with chronic pain. A nurse receives alerts from respond to sustained pain, and he or she contacts young patients to help manage their pain over time. This study is designed to assess the acceptability and impact of an intervention for children who have been suffering from acute paedic burns. The results suggest that there are no significant differences between parental protectiveness and child depressed symptoms after treatment. To further our understanding of how technology can be used to improve health and social well being, several studies have examined the use of ""non-pharmacical painmanagement"" as an alternative to conventional medical treatments. These studies include: 1) An attempt to investigate whether either Md procedural preparation or distraction has benefited pain reduction; 2) A comparison of three dressing change techniques over three different treatment methods; 3) A pilot study of 48 children aged 11-16 years with severe childhood pain; and finally 4) A prospective evaluation of the effectiveness of ipeer2peer's parent training program for parents with juvenile illle cell disease. It was found that both groups had similar levels of depression and anxiety at baseline. However, they did not show any difference in quality of life during follow-up. Finally, another study describes the efficaciousness of using h and hold Emotional Touch devices to treat sickle cells."
26003426,"In this paper, we describe the results of a short-term exercise intervention after laparoscopic prostitute therapy. After the 12 weeks, all physical function was better in the treatment group than with the control group. A further study is presented on the effect of resistance training on bone mineral density and body composition among men receiving androgen deprimation therapy for prostatecancer. The results suggest that ""pragmatic lifestyle intervention"" may have potential to improve health outcomes in patients with advanced disease. This evidence supports the use of strength training as an effective regimen for improving quality of life in post-prostate cancer patients."
14718486,"This paper focuses on the effects of two different exercise regimens over a two-year period on falls among older people. The first is based on r and Omized control trials, while the second is an observational trial with six months follow-up. In this study, elderly patients are assigned to either resistance or endurance training groups. They show significant gains in muscle strength after 12 weeks of both exercises. A further study examines the effect of progressive resistance weight training on muscle mass and bone turnover in older adults. Both groups show improvements in health and function. One group shows improvement in gait velocity but no change in quality of life. Another study compares home-based physical therapy with regular walking sessions for frail old people who have knee pain. Two studies assess the benefits of combined eat and exercise intervention on weight loss from older men with knee Osteoartritis. These studies aim to determine whether it is possible to train these patients without changing their lifestyle."
30709362,"This study focuses on the effects of an intervention with lifestyle changes on body weight and blood sugar in subjects with severe impaired glucose tolerance. After six months, the group experienced significant reductions in fasting and sacrificial blood pressure. At the end of one year, there was a significant increase in waist circumference, fat content, and total cholesterol. In this study, patients were randomized into either 'control' or /intervention' groups. The results showed that the treatment group had fewer complications than the control group; however, they did not show any improvement in other risk factors such as increased waist-circference or islet cell function. A further study was conducted to determine whether an intense lifestyle intervention could prevent type 2 Type 2 diabetes among people with prediabtes. It was found that both lifestyle change and diet plus exercise reduced the risk of developing Type 2, but no additional benefit was obtained from combining these two groups"
26858339,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to predicting distant breast recurryence using real time PCR. They report that the sensitivity of the Recurrence Score to predict distant disease is improved in patients treated with an adjuvant regimen. The results suggest that CEF and M. F. are superior to either regimen for distant opportune occurrences. A new method has been devised to use tissue samples from premenopauseal women who have node- positive breast cancer. This new technique uses tissue microarraies from 477 postmanoplenal females with nodes-positive breast tumors as controls. These studies confirm the efficacy of both regimens but do not reveal any significant differences in response to treatment. Furthermore, there is no significant association between topo 2's overexpression and benefit from anthroxin-containing chemotherapy."
29958304,"In this study, we examine the effect of probiotic and sympbiotic treatment on gut microbial community composition in patients with chronic kidney disease. The results suggest that both regimens may slow the disease process. However, they do not lead to significant changes in serum urea or concentrations of urine-derived toxins in subjects with advanced stage renal disease"
28290160,"A controlled trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a quality improvement intervention, consisting of two consultations and one follow-up phone call. The results indicate that patients receive improved risk factor measurements after 1 year in both groups. In addition, there is no significant change in recommended medication for those with high risk of heart disease. This study also compares the use of an automated blood pressure assessment system to standard care in three hospitals in two countries. It was found that hypertension was more likely to be treated by physicians than usual care. Both groups improve their lifestyle but no relevant differences were found between the groups at either measure point. Two studies are performed on different populations: first, they assess the impact of regular health checks on cardiovascular risk; second, these studies examine the effect of general health checkers on the severity of stroke and myocardialty. These studies aim to provide information about which type of treatment will be most effective in reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease among people with low social status. They conclude that this approach will help reduce the number of patients who have been identified as at high risks of coronary disease because it will allow them to make better decisions about their treatment."
27267795,"This paper discusses the latest developments in the field of surgical innovation. It focuses on two stages of evaluation: 1) observational studies and 2) long-term, controlled trials. The first stage is focused on patient safety and efficacy. In the second stage, patients are more likely to be successful because of their high quality results. For example, one patient with a very large hip that has loosened within two years shows significant improvement in survival over the next three years. However, this does not bode well for future follow-up."
24750271,"In this prospective, open-labeled study, we assess the effect of a 15-year period of growth replacement on bone mineral density and body composition in 126 adult hypopituitateary patients. After 2.3 years, there is no significant difference between mortality or morbidity in either group. Unexpected adverse events include insomnia, anxiety, sleep apologetics, and increased libidico. The mean initial dose of 0.03mg/day after fifteen years was not significantly different from that of untreated patients; however, it was observed that men responded with greater increases in serum level of IGFI and Biochemical Marks of Bone Metamorphism than women who received the same amount of human GH as was administered for nine months. There were no differences in the rate of death, cancer, Intrcranial tumor Wachstum or Recurrence, Diabetes, or Cardioenterprise in treated patients compared with those without treatment. We aim to clarify these issues by dodging large prospect if total and specific cause mortality in patients With hypo pituitanism. 573 adults had age at diagnosis vs female sextusory risk factors. Smeared Mortality Ration ratio was calculated as theratiate deaths to the numbers of deaths in An age-matched population. Conclusive Using recurrent disease, all subjects had hippopitarism proven on an Insulto test. All subjects have humbly received thrush therapy. A weight-based high-dose growthhormone replacement regimen leads to rapid withdrawal from growth Hormone. This study will evaluate risk of mortality, breast and prostate malignancies, myocaric infatriation, stroke, heart failure, etc."
27186129,"In this study, we examine the efficacy and safety of a single daily dose of piratetam in patients with senility who have been grafted to open heart surgery. The results suggest that piracetram may be an effective treatment for patients suffering from mild-tomidate encephalopathies. A double blind, placebo-control study is performed on 88 patients aged 67 years. This study compares the effects of two different anti-disease drugs, acetin-l-carine and ecstasyn, on brain function in acutely ill patients. After 12 months, there is no significant change in cognitive function among the two groups."
17943797,"A r-and-om sample from 3,006 people in Wichitatea, Kansas, was characterized by the presence of ""no pain, no widespread painful"" and widespread pain. Prevalence for fibromyalsis increased with age; the prevalence ranged between 60 to 79 years. The characteristics of fagitalgia are similar among community and clinic populations but overall severity, pain, and function are more severe within the general population. In this study, we examine the effects of exercise on mood and physical functions of subjects with  Fibrimyalgya. After 23 weeks of moderate exercise training, subjects showed significant improvements in their pain intensity scores and sleep quality. They also showed improvement in tender point pain intensities. These results suggest that there is a moderately responsiveness to changes in patient's symptoms."
28445352,"A prospective study of nine patients with breastcancer who underwent immediate breast reconstruction is presented. The results indicate that the ERAs program has no significant risk of complications and that it does not cause long-term morbidity. In addition, the patient's satisfaction with the recovery program is improved. Preoperative anesis was more effective in reducing pain after mastectomy than was conventional anesthesia. This paper also discusses the use of preoperative educational methods to improve decision-making among patients. It concludes that early physical rehabilitation is essential for improving quality of life during breast surgery."
27552970,"Three-week treatment of a novel, growth-hormone-releasing ligand induces vasolation, suppresses sympathetic nerve action, and increases the secretion of growth hormone in patients with chronic heptomies. In this study, we report that repeated administration improves valsalvin function, exercise capacity, muscle wasting, as well anamorellin on cachexia for advanced non- small cell lung cancer. We also report evidence for increased risk of breastcancer in carriers who carry the allele from the rs161707-Galletallele. Acute ences were not reported in either group. After 2.3 years, there was neither significant difference in mortality nor in any other adverse events. There was no significant change in rates of disease, tumor growth or return to normality. However, some studies have suggested that Igf-bindingprotein-3 may be protective against certain forms of malignancy. The concentration of Ghrelil greater than 3000 pgm/mL is associated with lowered riskof eophageal carcinoma. Gastric gholrelin levels are higher in men with advanced gastric diseases. Post-operating surgical procedures suggest that inflammatory factors contribute to post-operative GH release."
22889123,"This paper focuses on two groups of workers: the control group and the intervention group. The first group receives new lighting system, new workdays, and an optometrist's examination and corrects if necessary. After three years, the second group gets the same intervention but with different changes in workplaces and lighting systems. In this study, we examine the prevalence of pain during a six month period. Eighty people with muskuloskeletal disorders participate in dummy-controlled trials to compare the benefits of four different types of geometry keyboards. We find that the apple adjustable keyboard is more comfortable than the comfort keyboism system; however, there are significant differences in pain severity among the four options."
30626326,"In this paper, we describe a risk assessment tool that uses laboratory-based scores and office-derived scores to predict the risk of heart disease in ten different countries. We use recaliberated risk scores from national surveys as examples of how the score provides information about the proportion of people at different risks for each country. For example, our risk score estimates the likelihood of dying from syphilis by calculating the relative risk between men and women over 10 years. The results are reported in an eight-year trial of randomization with repeated lifestyle intervention. This does not lead to significant reductions in death from CHD. However, there is some evidence that smoking and blood cholesterol may have reduced the rate of death among high-risk patients."
21496652,"In this study, we compare the efficacy of mineral trioxidize aggregate with calcium hydrochlorides as a ""pullotomy"" agent in immure permanent teeth. The results indicate that Ca-OH-2 is superior to direct pulpoty in terms of pain and swelling at six and 12 months after treatment. Thirteen children with immature teeth were selected for these studies. Three intermediate base materials s : i.e. Cavitec, Life, Dycal ; and two calcium-hyxide lines were used as direct or indirect pulp dressing agents as clinically indicated. No significant difference in histological evaluation resulted from either material's in the Complete caries removal groups or the indirect/direct pulpcapping groups. A rapid and simple procedure would allowthe general practitioner to treat this procedure whenever necessary at dentists without specialist facilities beneath conditions that avoid excessive contamination of the Pulp. This paper deals with disagreement regarding the practical management of pulpals exposed by carouses during the adult denitition, defines of successand failure of enddonc therapy."" Many differences of opinion remain in this field"
24529937,"The aim of the study is to determine whether a short-term exercise program will improve exercise capacity in patients with lung disease who have undergone lobectomy. A significant increase in work performances was recorded from 68 3 to 175 m. After rehabilitation, significant improvements were observed in both functional status and health related quality of life after therapy. In addition, resistance training and endurancetraining have similar effects upon peripheral muscle force, exercise ability and general health-respective qualityof life in chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease patients With peripheral Muscle weakness. Walking, cycling, arm cranking are also effective for improving strength but there is little effect on performance. Post-thoracotomemy treatment does not result in improvement in patient's fitness. However, it has been reported that exercise training can be used as an aid to reduce the risk of complications associated with surgery."
28559211,"Orlistat improves weight loss in overweight patients with a mean reduction of trigllycerides and lipoprotein-cholestrol. In addition, orlistate reduces blood pressure by improving the ratio of low density lipogenic cholesterol to high-denish lipomeprotein. This study is designed to assess the efficaciousness of oristat on weight management in obesity-prone patients. The results indicate that orlismat can be used as heaviness-reducing treatment for patients who have lost their body weight during an attempt to maintain regaining their weight."
26243549,"This study consists of two parts: 1) a non-retrieval control trial and 2) an in-depth investigation of the effect of trunk flexor strength on patients with post stroke. The first part consisted of thirty patients who had mild to moderately spraining their knees after stroke; the second part was devoted to estimating the change required for clinically significant improvement in knee muscles. Thirty patients were divided into two groups: 50 males and 80 healthy controls. In the first group, there was no significant difference in peak torque between the right or left directions of Trunk Rotation. A second purpose was to estimate whether the directionof trunk rotation would lead to any effect on muscle strength of post- Stroke hemiputlegic patients. Ten adults from both groups were studied. Their performance was measured at three speeds. No errors were found across sessions."
24710915,"A high-fiber, low-gi diet improves the lipid profiles of men in Insulin-Resistant subjects. In this study, we examine the effect of a ""lupin""-enriched diet on body weight, composition, and blood fat concentrations in overweight individuals. The results suggest that an enlightened diet may be more effective in reducing total lipoprotein content and improving the risk of cardiovascular disease. This study is aimed at evaluating the effects of two different types of diets on changes in body mass, cholesterol, leptomin, trigglycerides, glucose,and insulin in healthy older adults."
23035863,"In this study, infants were given a pre-biotic mixture of Lactobillus paracasidas and Bifdobactericia. The results showed that the combination of short chain galacide and long chain fiberooligosesaccharides had fewer upper lung tract infection episodes and reduced antibiotic use. This study also examined the effect of probiotic formulas on intestinal microbiotism in healthy children aged 3 to 24 months. Infants received either an assigned formula or one of two different forms of prebiotics. Both groups gained greater weight gain during their first six months of life. They also developed less frequent upper respiratory tract outbreaks and more frequent antibiotic prescriptions than those in the placebo control group. A mixture consisting of neutral short chains galactoOLIGOSACCHARDES and Long chain fructo Oligosacchardes was shown to have anti-infective effects comparable to humans milk olidoiscarrides. These effects did not last beyond the intervention phase. However, it was concluded that these protective effects would be lasting after the treatment period. After three years, consumption of formula with Blactium and S. Hortensius was safe and resulted in sufficient growth, reduced reporting for colic or irritation, and lowered frequency of antibioticuse."
28079254,"In this study, the authors report that patients with a high level of blood-stained markers are at an increased risk for cardiovascular death and nonfatality. They conclude that beta blockers can be used to delay surgery even though they may have some side-effects. The results suggest that it is important to use these devices in the early post-surgery setting because there might be no need for additional testing. A cohort of 1057 patients from the AtHerogene registry has been studied over the past 30 years. These patients have had their first heart attack or stroke within seven days after surgery. This trial was designed to assess whether highly &#8216bgr'1-specific/Bissolol'd blocker was associated with reduced risk of Postoperative Stroke'. It found that those who were treated with bisoprollial therapy had fewer risks of stroke than those without such treatment. After 11 patients died during the periopera period, up to one month later, another group of patients received additional bistoprolola therapy. Mortality among small abdominal artery aneuryms was 54.3 percent; men had higher rates of rupture. Although initial results of open repair were promising, current evidence does not convince us that open repairs are superior to endovascular ones. There are several other studies which confirm this association. One of the most recent trials uses case control to determine the effects of statin on long- term survival after open wounds as well as to identify other potential risk factors"
25686893,"A shunt-infection rate was found to be a significant risk factor in patients with severe acute opportunities for infection. The authors developed an antimicrobial treatment that resulted in no significant differences in the risk factors of infection between the groups. In this study, the use of acetylthoxone or trimethicum-sulphfamescenle as prophylaxes was used to reduce the rate of ventricularoperitoal spitting disease. This study also focuses on the safety of using vancomycin instead of cefasolin for the prevention and subsequent post-operative management of these infections."
18797052,"In this paper, the authors assess the quality of reporting for primary treatment of patients with brain tumors. They compared the efficacy of two different types of therapy in wound healing. The first was a topical hypnotic solution and the second was an over-the-top anti-inflammation cream. Both were found to be superior to the control group in terms of wound improvement."
15330925,"In this study, Wuthering Heights demonstrates the efficacy of psychological treatment for patients with ""medically unexplainable physical symptoms"" in comparison to conventional medical care. After six months, the intervention group reports improved recovery rates and less pain than the controls. The control group also shows an improvement in sleep. There is no overall advantage between 16-session therapy and 8-week treatment; however, Beck Depression Inventory scores are equally effective. For patients suffering from severe irritablebowel syndrome, they are assigned either hypnotism or psychotherapy. Both groups show significant improvements in their symptoms. However, there is a higher prevalence of mental disorders in those without major endoscopies. Only 29 cases have major endsoscopic abnormalities. This study determines whether psychological treatments can be more effective in treating these patients. It concludes that brief psychological interpersonal treatment can improve both quality of life and severity of illness in patients who have chronic irrational bowel disease."
21328298,"In this study, the effects of a fast track approach on post-open colonosctal surgery is compared with that of conventional open surgery. The results show that laparoscopic or fasttrack surgery can be more cost effective than open surgical treatment. A multi-arm, three-armed multicentre trial is designed to determine which method of care is most cost-effective in patients with colonic disease. It is divided into three groups: 1) open conventional surgery; 2) fast tracks; and 3) traditional management. All three methods are shown to have significant advantages over each other in terms of patient satisfaction, short-term recovery, and complications."
26864742,"The mean age of the patient population is forty-four. This paper describes a study in which thirty-six patients with pyuricemia were followed in reheumatological centers across Italy. Thirty six patients showed improvement in their pain and function after wearing one pair of shoes for eight weeks. A second study was designed to determine whether an 8-week course of shoe wear could reduce foot pain, musculonoskeletal disability, and bone erosion in patients suffering from gout. In this study, nineteen men with no rheurmatic conditions were recruited. Nineties-one men had been recruited but none had aged more than 42 years. Methods were then performed on all patients except those with severe grotesque arthropathy. Ult revealed signs of crystal deposition in most joints. However, some patients did not show any change in pain or swelling during the following 7 days."

27755209,"The effect of eccentric-focusing resistance training on muscle mass, strength, and functional capacity in older adults was compared with conventional resistance exercises. In this study, elderly subjects were divided into two groups: one group exercised at different frequency intervals; the other group consisted of either a balance training group or an endurance training control group. Both groups showed significant increases in leg power, but no significant differences between groups. This study is designed to investigate the benefits of weight-bearing therapy for older women. It shows that it can be used to improve physical function as well as reduce risk of falls."
29686540,"This paper focuses on cost-effectiveity of a fall prevention program for older people. Costs are calculated based on the number of falls, injuries, and hospital costs that occurred during the trial. The mean cost to prevent falls in this study was about three times the cost of usual care. In addition, there is mixed evidence of the efficacy of home-based exercise as an intervention against falls. For example, when compared to standard care, the average cost per person over 2.6 months was almost double that of regular care; however, it does not appear to be cost effective."
26836148,"In this study, we investigate the effects of a single g marihualana cibber on women's luteal and menstrual levels of testosterone. After smoking one-g marhuanol cigarette, no suppressive effect was seen in the same females under double blinded conditions. This suggests that marihaanina may have an adverse effect on reproductive function during these two periods."
26239041,"In this paper, we examine the role of a drug voucher program in promoting general drug use. We conclude that it is associated with an increase in adjusted Overall GDR for both intervention groups and control groups. A decentralized drug budget appears to improve overall quality of care among patients who have limited access to health care. The results of two separate multi-level regression analysis indicate that the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap is related to modest reductions on the use of Antidepressant drugs. Relying on comparisons between the different types of practice, our study suggests that fundholding practices are better able to limit their growth in their prescribebing costs than non-faculty practices."
30002686,"In this study, we examine the effect of a high-dose of magnesium on patients with acute coronary disease. We found that lower levels of Magnesium were associated with lowered risk of heart disease in patients who had first experienced an acute myocarditis. This was due to the fact that they had higher blood pressure than controls. The results suggest that there may be some protective effects from increased magnesium consumption in these patients. A double-blinded placebo-control trial was conducted in which 62 subjects and non- pregnant females aged 18 years or older were assigned to receive either chloride or NaHco3 dissolved solution once daily for three months. Both groups showed no significant differences in their serum levels. They also did not show any improvement in asthma control. However, it was reported that Mg seemed to improve asthma function in both groups. After adjustment for other risk factors, such as hypertension, diet, and alcohol use, the relationship between Mm and the risk for development of hypertensity was established."
21733234,"Paroxelini and alprasolam are more effective in the long term than either of the other two drugs, but they remain in treatment for a further 8 months. In this study, we examine the efficaciousness and safety of both sertraline and placebo in patients who have been suffering from panic disorder. The results suggest that tolerance doesn't develop to the therapy effects of either medication; however, it is not considered as established until over an extended time period. A total of 100 773 patients were included among the intention-treatment population. Meditates were divided into three groups: one group was assigned to receive 10 weeks of singleblind placebo; another group received double blindd treatment with either solrotin or placebo. Serotonin induces anxiety at rest and exercise reduces CCK4-induced attacks. This study compares fluvoxine with placebo on 50 patients with panic disorders. All active treatment groups show greater proportions free of full symptoms panic attacks compared with placebo. Although attempts aimed at increased use of selective seirotonergic reupTake blockers are discussed. Panic attack sufferers often utilise physical health care systems more frequently than those in their general community. There is evidence that persons with panic disorder /anxiety may utilisation the physical medical care system morefrequently than people within the general public and so incurfor themselves, and imposing on the publichealth caresystem considerably greater costs. These studies represent one of few comparisons between medical utilization and costs borne by people with nervous disorder to those without such anxiety disorder -- in this case social phobia. It is probably because specific characteristics do make it difficult for them to be associated with these problems. However, there are some concerns about the effectiveness of clonic antidepresstants in treating panic disease. For example, gabapanentin has shown significant improvements in severity after 12 weeks when paired with leveracetam. Another study investigates the effect of cognitive behavior on patients experiencing panic illness. After 18 months, no change in response occurs. No changes in patient status occur during the half dose maintenance period except for weight gain and dizzines. Both regimens lead to improved scores on measures of fear, anxiety, depression, quality of life. They also provide details on how many patients fail to respond to any type of intervention. Some patients require longer-term treatment. Other conditions include anxiety and stress which can be treated through"
29676540,"The changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma TG levels were significantly greater among the WL-FEE group than those in the other two groups. In addition, increased arterial stiffness was associated with improved risk of cardiovascular diseases in obese individuals. A moderate dose is given to n-3 fats for two mo reduces adoposity and an atherogenic marker without deteriorating of insulinsensitivity in Type 2 diabetes subjects. This study is registered at clinical trial. It shows that weight loss and energy consumption are unchanged in this group but total fat mass is reduced by fish oil than in placebo group. Conclusions A mild dose of p-3 PUfas improves both glycation and atheogenic markers without improving disease severity in subjects with Type 1 diabetes. However, confirmatory studies are required because of the limited number of patients studied. There is evidence against the use of omega-3 polyensulated fatty acid as an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes but its complications still remain poorly understood."
28741090,"In this open-labeled study, patients were randomized to receive either tadasalafil or sil dental for 8 weeks. After the initial treatment, they were cross-overed with different groups of patients. The most frequently preferred drug attributes explained treatment preference were better efficacy and improved sexual satisfaction. Both groups had similar scores on the International Index of Encemented Function, Sexual Self-confidence, and Erectile Hardness scales. When compared with the baseline, both groups improved all outcome measures. A significant improvement in sexual qualityof life scores was reported at end point in male patients as well as female partners inboth groups. This study is designed to determine the risk factors for ED and to identify the best treatment for men and women. Most patients have moderate sedation of between 190 and 1 of 192 eligible patients; 126 prefer thadalpil than silldenafile. Men with edemicles are treated persistently: 78.1 vs 64.9 %) respectively. They also showed improvements in GAQ, Seech, Spontanity, Time Concerns, Esteem And Relationship Scores but did not show any difference in other treatment outcomes."

The mean pain score is 1.6 and ranges 0 to 3. With all reporting no painful 15 minutes afterthe procedure was recorded. Purpose: To examine the infection rate after flexible Cysoscopy and determine whether Prophylactic Norfloxacian reduces this incident compared with other antimicrobials. No difference in infection rates were found between groups. Urodynamics And Cystarethroscyscoscopies After 27 months were offered enrollment; 142 were assigned to receive either prophylaxes or placebo. There were no significant differences in Demographic characteristics nor final diagnoses among groups as well as no statistically significant changes in the incidence of Uti after urethoscopic procedures. Preprocedures Prior to Cysterectoism Inducing antibiotic pre-progelaxis before urodynastic and cystostrucation are important for reducing the risk of developing urinary tract infections."

28394643,"A safety study is performed on 108 healthy volunteers aged 18-62 years. The subjects receive either aspartame or placebo three times per day for 24 weeks. No changes in vital signs, body weight, and results of laboratory tests are noted. There are no significant differences between group in the frequency with which they experience symptoms. In elderly subjects, there is a decrease in plasma concentration of visceral factor after glucose loading. However, this does not affect fibrinolycemia. This study compares the effects of sweeteners added to diet over four weeks on food intake, mood, BMI, fat loss, exercise, blood sugar levels, free fatty acids, etc. Over two weeks, both groups lose significantly more weight than did the control group. They also have greater weight loss during follow-up periods. Both groups lost about 10 lb at initial weight gain. Consuming sucrose sweetened soft drinks has been associated by obesity, the metabolic disease,and cardiovascular disorders in observed and short- term intervention studies. Conclusions higher consumption of sugarsweetened beverages was associated with an increased magnitude of weight gained and an increase risk for developmentof type 2 diabetes. Women who consumed more sugar- Sweetened Soft Drinks had relative risks of Type 2 Diabetes of 1.83 p.m. compared with women who only consumed less than one of these Beverages per month."

This study focuses on the association between physical and psychological characteristics and symptoms in an African economic developed worksite. The results suggest that there may be a relationship between these risk factors and shoulder, neck, and forearm pain. In this study, we examine the effect of mentally challenging workstations on upper-trapezius muscles. Muscle activities are more sensitive to stress than those of other muscle groups. A case control study is designed to assess the effects of different types of muscular activity on patients who have trapezusmyalgiA."
20512292,"In a series of patients with severe acute hypertension, the combination of nidipine or capstopril is shown to be safe and efficacious in reducing blood pressure rapidly. A further study was performed on 57 patients who had been treated with either captoprim or nicotine.

Heart rate did not increase significantly in these groups. These results suggest that long- acting calcium antagonist lacipine could be more effective than short-acters drank by other agents. Twenty patients aged between 22, and 59 year old were included in another study. This study investigated the safety andefficacy of open label nocturnal use of aldosteone for the management of acute serious hypotension."
19370565,"In this study, we examine the effects of an herbal blend on men with a benign prostatichypoplasia. The results are similar to those seen in placebo-controlled studies. A double blinded, rand omizing trial is performed to assess the effect of saw palmtto on Urinary Scores, sexual function, and Urodynamic Rates in men who have lower urinary Tract symptoms. After completing the trial, patients receive either saw or placebo for six months. This treatment does not improve any of the symptoms of Boph disease. However, it does improve some of these symptoms as well. Saw palmito extract has been shown to be more effective than other treatments in treating such conditions. For example, when used together with another natural product, Cernitin, Saw PalmetTo, B-Si Tosterol, Vitamin E, or Tamsulopsin can significantly reduce nocturia and severity. When taken alone for three months, combined with other natural products, can lessen noxuria; however, they do not increase the severity of symptoms at all."
24857402,"In this paper, we examine the impact of a combination of self-help intervention called M.C.T. in patients with new-onset psyched disorder. The results suggest that those who are initially treated for their depression will have better health-related qualities of life than they would be if they were not depressed. We also assess the effect of antidepressive treatment on mental health and quality of living in first-patients with newly onset schizophrenia. Although there is little difference in cost per patient when compared to usual care, it is clear that Mact is more cost effective than other treatments. A large rand and ommized trial was carried out in 6 mentally health care centers in Netherl where 371 patients had DSMIV-III cluster C diagnoses. This study included three different types of therapy: long term outpatient, short-time day hospital, quick-term inmate, and long time inpatient psychothérapie. These studies examined the efficacy of each type of treatment as well as the costs associated with them. For bipolar disorder, ""the brief form of Cognitive Therapy, Manual-Assisted Cognitive Behavior therapy vs treatment As usual 'for deliberate self harm'"" showed significant improvements in both mood and physical symptoms. Art therapy has been used as an alternative treatment for people with severe anxiety disorders; however, these studies did not find any differences between the effectiveness or costeffectiveness of either treatment."
29888490,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to fracture repair by using an advanced fabrication technique. They describe how they use OptiBoned S cement to improve the strength of the fragments that are bonded to the teeth after being cut open. The results show that the material used to bond the tooth to composite resin is more effective than the other two materials. This paper also discusses the effect of different dry storage intervals upon the bonding of both pieces of tooth and crown."
22265381,"Back pain is a very common cause of both psychological and physical disability in the elderly. Although there are many good-quality studies reporting on the role of these factors in back pain, few have been directly compared to those of the general population."
15754663,"In this paper, we describe a double blinded, parallel- group study of 33 patients who have major depression. We find that the change in Hamilton Depression Rating scale is significantly predictive of their response at six weeks. The results are similar for both groups but no significant differences occur between the two treatment groups either in severity or frequency of adverse events. A doubleblind trial compares fluoxetine and melancholy to sertraline in patients over 70 years with DSMIII Major Depressive disorder. Both drugs improve on measures of depressed symptoms, including reassuring behavior, but neither does they improve memory performance. Two other studies compare venlfaxine with flicit in elderly patients suffering from mild or moderate depression; one examines the safety of rebotics as an antipsychotic while the other evaluates efficacy by measuring the Hamilton Rating Score for depression and the ClinicalGlobal Impressions scale."
21414043,"In this study, we examine the effects of a weight loss diet on features of fat loss and blood lipidemia in overweight patients. Both diets have significant changes in both body composition and absorption of energy. After six months, the Protein group loses more weight than the Carbohydrate group. The results are similar to those obtained with the carbohidrate group: reductions in total and sub-primary lipoproteins, reduced levels of triacylglucycerol, and improved health status. This study concludes that increasing the portion of protein to carbohydrates in an adult woman's diet has beneficial effects on body structure, blood sugar, glyceric concentration, as well as the ratio of ""Tag/HDL"" cholesterol."
28968486,"The present trial investigates the effect of a protein-hybrisate formula on preterm infant growth and development. Thirty six preterminal infants were divided into three groups, each group receiving either an extensively hydrolyzated or stand and ardpreterm formula until they reached full feeds. In the first group, there was little difference in gastric motility between the two regimens; however, in the second group it was significantly shorter than with the conventional formula. This study also examined the effects of early feeding for the risk of allergic diseases. Preterm children with one parent or sister were assigned to receive either cow milk-based or extensively-hydrallyzed formula from 4 to 5 months of age. These studies showed that the use of the thoroughly-Hyrisate Formula had fewer adverse effects on weight gain and body mass than the other treatments. However, the new formula did not lead to changes in insulin concentration or in blood levels."
30249972,"In this study, we examine the effects of a combined form of vitamin E-Vite and alpha-Tocopherol on patients with alcoholic fatty lip disease. The results indicate that atorvastasin 20mg combined with vitaminsC and E is highly effective in preventing hepatosis in children with nonalcoholic fat liver disease at an early age. We conclude that it is not possible to treat these conditions by itself; however, there are some promising approaches. For example, metformin can be used to reduce systemic inflammation in obese children. A recent study suggests that zinc and selitum may be beneficial for treating steatopsia in adults without alcohol use. This study also reports that both forms of treatment are superior to placebo when compared to their efficacy in terms of improving histology."
31168050,"In this study, we examine the effects of amylose-rich starch, HAM-Rs2, on Type 2 diabetes in women. We find that it is more effective in improving blood lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in subjects with Type 1 than in controls. This suggests that RS may be useful as an aid to improve blood sugar control in patients with type 2 who are at high risk for Type 3 disease."
25053215,"This paper focuses on the use of incentives to promote weight loss in overweight patients. It uses a mixed-effects model to examine the efficability of two different approaches: 1) an incentive-based treatment that involves walking and physical activity, 2) an education intervention that includes drug counseling, and 3) an exercise intervention with monetary rewards. The results suggest that both approaches are effective at improving long-term body weight Loss is not improved by increased walk attendance. Post-hoc analysis suggests that the levels of exercise neededfor successful long term weight reduction are much higher than those usually recommended in behavior treatment programs for example, some have accused financial incentive schemes of coercing, inequitable, inconsistent with shared values, etc. These arguments are understated from classical economic theory. In this essay, Hamilton discusses the ethical arguments used to challenge incentive systems as well as the need for further analysis"
27452342,"In this paper, the authors describe the use of two different types of inlays for a single or multi-faced cavity. The first is an indirect resin composite that has been used for over ten years and shows excellent results in terms of patient comfort. Second is direct porcelain fillings with no margin opening. Third is semi-direct hollow composite restorations which show little difference in the outcome after three years."
27218592,"A randomized, open-label study comparing the efficacy of two different treatment regimens for recurring BV in women with and without vaginal intervention. The first group was a combination of probiotic strains from Lactobacilus rhumnosus gr-1 and Lactinus recitulum RC 14, while the second group consisted of placebo capsules. In this single-blind, rat-free study, we found that both groups experienced remarkably similar deterioration in venous pH after one or two weeks of treatment."
30514444,"In this study, the results of direct pulpcapping are compared with those of conventional methods. The results indicate that Ca-OH is superior to MTA in terms of cupping ability and tooth healing. This paper also reports on the use of Em Dogain Gel as a scaffold for dentin bonding."
28003033,"A prospective, observational study comparing the risk of death for older adults in their mid-thirties to that of younger, more physically active adults. The results suggest that the Short Physical Perfection Battery, or ""SPPB,"" is superior to other measures of physical performance in predicting mortality in older patients with acute illness. In this study, we examine the association between the short physical perfunctory battery score and the rate of functional decline in elderly patients who have been discharged from the hospital. We conclude that there is little evidence of an interplay between mobility and consciousness for prediction of long-term health risks."
29740667,"In this study, we examine the relationship between dietary and bone mineral density within the Women's health initiative. We find that there is no significant association between diet and fracture risk among women who consume more than 95g of animal protein per day. The effect of a 30-month dairy intervention on bone loss was not studied in detail. However, it was found that consumption of higher amounts of dairy could reduce the risk of fracture. This study furthermore investigates the effects of an increased amount of fruit and vegetable food on bones. It finds that increasing levels of these foods may prevent or delay hip fracture for older women. Furthermore, studies have shown that increases in vegetables and fruits are associated with reduced risks of all fractures. A recent study suggests that high-protein meals can be beneficial to bone health."
30099652,"The aim of the study is to evaluate whether probiotics alter the gut microbeta, and reduces levels of microbiomes-generated uresmic toxins in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease. In this study, twenty-five studies have been published. A doubleblind trial has been conducted in 21 patients who received three capsules of Streptcococcus Hortensius, Lactobacterus acidphilus or Bifidinobacterium Longum. After two weeks nephromectomy stabilization, cohorts were fed caseIn-based dietplus one ofthe following regimens: a) control, b) subsequences ; c) blood ureamine-nitrogen concentrations -- measured by creatinineconcentration -- v) placebo / casein-base diet without proicrobials as well as Bacillus Pasturiii. No significant changes on gastrointestinal symptoms occurred during the treatment group. This study was designed to assess the efficacy for Renadyedl in end stage renal disease patients. It was primarily based on small sample size but did not result in any significant change in kidney function."
32428841,"The effect of a low-energy dense diet on weight loss, lipids, and risk factors in overweight patients is not yet known. In this study, we examine the effects of an energy restriction program on body weight, blood pressure, lipoprotein profiles, as well Assigning disease severity to obese patients with obesis has not been reported. However, there are some studies that suggest that fasting can be beneficial for weight management. Wei argues that ""Meanwhile fasters are healthier / metabolically speaking"". A large number of studies have shown that moderate energy restrictions may reduce the risk of heart disease but little evidence exists regarding their efficacy. For example, one study showed that exercise was associated with improved fat loss in obese subjects. Another study examined whether increased physical activity could lead to reduced risks of cardiovascular disease. This study also examined the use of high-calorie diets to prevent excessive weight gain among overweight adults."
32059350,"In this paper, we use height and education as controls to find stronger evidence for a causal relationship between the risk of developing schizophrenia and the likelihood of using cannabinol or other drugs to treat it. We conclude that there is strong evidence supporting an association between alcohol and mental health in humans. The odds ratios of both groups are 1.04 per double odds of starting with cannabis; however, the positive control group shows better performance than the negative control on measures of speed, language fluency, animal naming, verbal learning, and memory. Furthermore, they demonstrate improved performance when compared to the placebo group. This suggests that some sort of genetic instrument for schizophrenia may be stronger than for the initial initiation of drug use. A large genome- wide association study was performed to identify eight genomic variants associated with the presence of either substance use or mental illness. These results suggest that ""candal use disorder"" is more likely to lead to psychotic disease than any other cause."
29564527,"In this large, prospective, controlled study, Hamilton demonstrates that the contact force fembarbation technique is superior to cryoballon ablation for paroxy-smal atrium fibrillation in the United States. He also compares the shorter time required for fluoroscopies and procedure times as well as major complications. The results suggest that it is cost-effective to treat patients without anadythic therapy."
26293406,"The aim of this study is to determine whether the beneficial effect of an atrial pacemaker is maintained during long follow-up. After a period of eight years, patients with sick Sinus Syndrome should be treated by an inductively pacing system rather than by conventional ventricular paced therapy. In this paper, we examine the rate of complications following first implant or elective replacement of standard pacemakers. There are 26 complications among 25 patients. A large multi-centre trial involving 407 patients receiving vexed pacemaking shows that dual chamber versus single chamber technology reduces the risk of heart failure and death due to congestive symptoms associated with Retrograde Conduction. This report also describes the cause specific modes of death as well as the benefits of both types of devices. Pace maker implantation improves almost all quality of life measures. The mode selection trial was performed on 2,010. Patients with sinus nodes dysfunction were selected with either one chamber or two chamber device. Costs include initial paceyer augmentation and all healthcare follow up costs over 5.2 years. At 3 months after completion of the study, the mean age of patient was 76 plus / 6 years; 234 men were male. When followed up for 5 years there was no change in blood pressure between the two modalities."
31928080,"In this study, Wu et al.1 demonstrate that coconut oil has a beneficial effect on blood lipids in healthy men or women by reducing the risk of heart disease and improving lipoprotein concentration. The results of this trial are reported in this paper. After four weeks of consumption of one of these three fats, coconut-oil, butter or olive oil, in 40 healthy adults, changes in blood composition, weight, and fat distribution were observed. These changes were not seen in either group. They were found to be significantly lower in total cholesterol, LDLcholesterol, as well as in triacylicglyceride concentrations. This is significant because it suggests that diets rich in oils do not alter body composition but rather influence their biological functions."
26888184,"Antithrombotic therapy for strokes is recommended for patients with either paroxysmal or persistent atrial fillation. The narrator reports that patients who have persistent or parosmal atrium fiilation are younger, less likely to have heart failure, and more often treated with warfari than with aspirin. Aim concludes that the risk of stroke in these patients is similar to that of those with permanent ailment. In particular, there is little information about the attendant risks of systemic emboliscence in this group of patients."
25121789,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to evaluating the effectiveness of an on-the-go low-cost intervention for women with breast or cervixcancers. They employ sixteen health workers who have college graduation as their basic qualification and examine 2069 subjects in order to assess the reliability of the test. The results indicate that the compliance to diagnostic examinations is 73 percent among screen- positive women referredfor breast and 78 p.m. among women refered for both types of disease. This study focuses on the effects of ""streamlining tasks and roles to exp and treatment and care for HIV"" which provides educational training of nurses so that they can represcribe antidepressant therapy and de central isolacation. Within public primary care centers in Goa, trained lay counsellor's work within supervised care model can reduce epidemics of common mental disorder and improve patient satisfaction. A cluster-rand-omized control trial was conducted in Trivy and Rum district, India; the cost per life year saved was calculated by all eligible individuals but for high risk individuals such as tobacco or alcohol use. An exercise-based approach were employed to calculate Cost associated with various parts Of the screening trial. After 1 year, 105 patients had retained in the program. Another study was carried out to compare the effect of reduced transportation costs on patient retention rate for cardiovascular disease in rural health areas in Central Cammeroon Country. It found that there was no additional intervention except for one month of freetreatment every forth month from regularly respected visits. However, it showed that these patients did not receive any further treatment afterward. These studies suggest that more cost-effective approaches may be used to reduce deaths due to breast/cervixcaval disease than those using mammography."
25323058,"In this study, we examine the effects of a combination of anti-hysterics and diuretics on blood pressure in elderly patients. The results suggest that treatment with either angiotensol-converting enzyme or calcium channel blockser may be more effective than conventional methods for preventing stroke and heart failure in older adults. We conclude that there is no significant trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events or death in those with treated bloodpressure 140 mmHG. However, it is unclear whether this trend is due to the fact that age-related hypertension is associated with greater riskof fatalities. A pilot study was conducted in which 1283 patients aged 80 years old were assigned one of three regimens: 1) ""diuretic-base regimen"" 2) ""anotensin convertor blocker"" 3) ""calcium channel blockers."" This trial was well matched by mean age ; 76.1 years had been reached after 3 years. Blood pressure decreases significantly from 160 mHg to 147.0 / 13.5/75.7 x 9.5 mpH G. After examining the relationship between achieved bp and other major events, such as stroke, myocaral infusoration, and chest pain, our conclusion is that strict control of Bp is superior to moderate control over less stringent ones."
31553733,"In this paper, the authors present a cost-effective national atrial fillation detection program that is more cost effective than routine care. They conclude that it is possible to increase the age of the initial trial or increase its interval for further evaluation. The results suggest that there may be an advantage in raising the start age and increasing the interval of time for screening. A Markov model is used to predict costs and outcomes in comparing patients with and without screen over the courseof 25 years. Atrial fibrillations are common in the Spanish community older than 40 but only 1 out of every 100 patients receives anticoagulant treatment. This study was able to identify whether blood pressure devices were superior to pulse checks in terms of their specificity."
31944175,"In this study, we systematically examine the effects of atrial fibrillation on utility in patients without known atheotic fever. We conclude that there is a significant association between attritial fibrillation and transient Ischemic attack. The 1-year risk of stroke from an insertable cardreader was 6.7 percent. A subset of patients with no prior stroke or tia were excluded. This study also determines the relative safety of APXABAN for treating cryptogenic strokes. It finds that warfarin reduces major bleeding in those with previous stroke but does not increase the cost of treatment."
23697478,"In this study, pharmacists and primary care physicians are able to improve blood pressure control for patients with uncontrollable hypertension. The results of the pharmacist-led program are inconclusive but suggest that it may be useful in some patients who have high risk of heart failure. This study is a prospective, i.e., open-label, random-experimentation study designed to determine whether an evidence-based, systematic approach can be used to manage hypertensible patients. It has been shown that community pharmacy practices can achieve better blood flow control than usual care when combined with patient education and lifestyle changes. A physician-and-practitioner teamwork intervention appears to reduce blood vessel resistance in patients at higher risk for cardiovascular disease."
29765895,"In this study, the authors place 30 restorations of clearfil se bond. Thirty tooth-exampled teeth are used for dentin repair. The results show no significant differences in patient sensitivity between seals and other materials at any time during the six-month recall period. A self-etched adhesive system is tested to determine the strength of its bonding ability. It is compared with that of an enamel-etching system. Bonding experiments are performed on four groups of teeth. Each group receives three different treatments: Scotchesbond multi-purpose, SBMP primer and Adhesive Z-100 resin; single bond, G4), acid +Optibond Solo; G5 -- acid/Naocl B1= 9.38-3.105a; and restorative polymerized composite resin."
25609995,"In this paper, we examine the predictors for pain and function after total knee surgery in fifty-five patients. We find that the United Kingdom is more likely to experience pain than the other countries. This paper focuses on the preoperative prediction of pain at one year and two years post-surgery. The Western Onion and McMaster university OsteoArtitis Index, Short Form 36, and Demographic data were obtained from self-assessed patient question ennewers. For 102 patients, significant pain reported by 73%, 44.6 % ; 22.6 %) compared with those from other European countries who had no pain prior to surgery. A further study was performed on 190 patients with chronic back pain. Pain catatstrophizing appeared to be a useful measure of improvement in these patients but did not affect their performance during the surgical period. These results may contribute to the advancement of more effective treatments within the context of double blind reand omised controlled parallel trialof two nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory drugs. While surgeon outcomes following total Knearthroplasty are quite good, many patients continue to suffer long-term painfulness. Depressive symptoms are particularly important because they are associated with higher acute pain complaints. However, there is some evidence that levels of both anxiety and depression are related to elevated pain scores later in the follow-up phase of the procedure. Finally, several patients underwent complete knee arthrostry who undergone multiple knee replacements showed better pain outcome."
28868822,"The effect of green tea extract on postpranolescent women was studied. No significant changes in energy consumption, body weight, BMI, or waistcircference were observed over twelve mo in women who took GTE. Within- group comparison also revealed a significant reduction in the waist circumference, homa-irse index, and insulin levels. In addition, there was no significant difference in blood pressure between the two groups. Postprain and iual hyperglycemia and anoxic stress increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes andCVD. Both groups consumed their designated beverages with morning and lunch. Change in homeostases model assessment showed that increased insulin resistance was significantly reduced in Gynostemmas pentaphorum group compared with control group. A doubleblind, placebo controlled study was performed in adults with Type 1 diabetes mellitateus not taking Insulin. This study examined the effects of Green tea Extract on patients with post-altered acne. After three months, the mean change in hemoglobin was + 0.4 / 95 %confidence interval ; 0.2'- 0.7,  0.5 p>. The major end point was improvement in glycositylated hemogloin at 3months. These results are not significantly different from other studies. Metamorphosis is used as outcome measure for this study. It was found that the decafinated green leaf extract improved both skin appearance and wound healing in mice. Biomarkers such as glucose regulation, inflammation and bleeding were measured after 9 months. At 18 months they were able to improve psychological state and quality of life."
28506257,"The results of this study suggest that homeopathy is superior to placebo in reducing pain and improving quality of life for persons with a fibromyosis condition. Forty-three patients completed the treatment program. There were only minor effects on pain score and function, but no adverse events. Acute exacerbations were the most significant. Nabilone was more effective in improving insomnia than either amiriptyline or nabilione. To assess medicinal plants' efficacy on fagitalgia, we compare eight randomed placebo-controlled studies with 475 patients. Our results demonstrate that MP orRNP had significant improvements on improving the severity of afflicted patients; however, longer tests are needed to determine the safety of using these alternative treatments. In addition, acupuncture improved pain scores and qualityof life in patients with Fibrimyalgies. This study also focuses on short-term efficacy by comparing it to fluoxetine in treating mutilated tumours. It showed that both groups received significantly greater pain relief during the followup period."
22796243,"This study focuses on the effects of two-handed tasking on posture and balance in patients with nonspecific back pain. The subjects show significant improvements in their postural control after eight weeks of exercise, but they do not show any changes in disability scores or fear avoidance beliefs after this intervention period. In contrast, the MI group shows no change in these parameters after 8 weeks; however, they have improved significantly in confidence scores and Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire work score. A blinded, sequential, pragmatic control trial was conducted to determine whether there is a difference in the center of tension between patients suffering from chronic lowback pain and healthy subjects. Seventyseven patients were divided into two groups: those with low Back Pain and those without. Sixteen healthy volunteers performed three different breathing tasks under three respiratory rate conditions. Posturokinetic capacity was determined by three static Bipedal St and ing exercises of 90 sec Duration with eyes closed at firm surface. Results showed that both groups had poorer body balance than controls. Proprioceptives existed in some patients reporting low back discomfort. However, propriority did not exist in either group. There was only one exception: young persons with painful back problems had an altered body position that might be due to anticipation of posture instability."
24166727,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective observational study in which 7 children with cow's milk allergicness were followed for 1 year. The first child was treated with soy and showed improved growth during follow up but was later found to have an ecsinophic disease at the end of the trial. We conclude that there is no cause for such an intolerance in infants who are not sensitive to dairy-based foods. Afcreatinia has been shown to be hypoallergenic as well as effective in treating patients with severe cow ""smilk allergy."" Thirty one children had mild-to-mid-life enceosis and were then followed up by another group of 30 patients. This population included only 66 patients out of 381 cases."
31583250,"The probiotic group showed a significant reduction in the weight gain of the placebo group over the trial period. In addition, it was found that there was no significant difference in blood glucacity or insulin resistance at any time during the study period; however, this needs to be clarified before any further studies are performed on pregnant women with Type 2 diabetes. A doubleblind, placebo controlled clinical trial was conducted among sixty-four pregnant females with GDM. The effects of gut microbeta were shown to have an effect on inflammation, oxidation stress, and pregnancy outcome. However, these results did not affect FPG or other measures of health. Furthermore, they had no effect upon total antioxidant capacity as well as on maternal and infant outcomes."
28166606,"In this study, we examine the effect of simvastatiin and eztimibe in treating patients with isolated acute coronary disease. The results are similar to those of other treatment regimens; however, more patients receive ezetimbe than simpvastatin. This is due to the greater improvement in lipid profile and lipoprotein concentrations that can be obtained by both groups. Furthermore, it is reported that adipogenin levels are reduced when combined therapy is used. These results suggest that there may be an advantage in using ezetibe as another anti-inflammatory agent."
23179416,"Two telephone surveys are conducted in April 18 and May 11 of 2003 to collect demographic, educational, employment, and income details. In addition, few subjects with ADHD are employed full time; a significant number of adults have been diagnosed with the disorder. The results indicate that children who respond to one treatment or the additions of behaviormodification also respond better to the other than those who receive no intervention. A study is presented for two groups of adult patients: those with attention-difference disorder and those without it. Both groups show improved performance on classroom behavior and school performance. For children with hyperactivity disorder, however, they do not show any improvement in their academic performance either. Methhylpha date has an effect on both learning and social behavior but does not improve academic achievement. Children with acute attention deficit disorder exhibit significant impairment during aging. This study examines the effects of long- acting stimulant medicine on several domainsof functioning in young children aged 5 to 12 years old. Adolescence is associated with increased risk of anxiety and depression as well as antisociality. Although there is little information about the adult consequences of these conditions, this study suggests that by their young adulthood, ADHD may be at high risk"
12917993,"In this paper, we present the results of a two-year study on girls with Turner's syndrome. The subjects receive either human growth hormone alone or combination treatment for three to six years. After these studies, all patients are expected to reach their adult heights. A further study is presented in this chapter that compares the effects of different dosages of human growthogen in women with Type 2 and Turner Syndrome. Both groups show rapid increases in height after treatment. For example, subjects receiving only hGH received an increase in total height from 11.3 to 15.1 cm/year over the control group. However, both groups showed greater changes in Bayley Pinneau predicted adults height than those treated with rhG. This suggests that early treatment may be more successful in improving the height of young girls who have Turner disease."
24529402,"This paper reports on a large, rand-omized controlled trial in England. It was divided into four groups of patients with different types of disease: diabetes, heart failure, and social care needs. The first group received telecare devices to track their health status; the second group had usual care. In this study, the results showed that ""integrated care"" led to lower hospitalizations for patients who had severe opstructive pulmonary disease. A further study was conducted to determine whether an improved quality of living could be achieved by using remote homemonitoring equipment. There was no difference in number of co-primary admissions or days of outpatient visits per year between these two groups. However, there were significant differences in patient satisfaction when compared to those in the control group. These results suggest that it is not necessary to use expensive technology to improve patient comfort but rather to provide more cost effective services."

25329390,"The results of this study suggest that activity-programs with or without a aerobic training component may result in important improvements in physical function. Eighty patients with juvenile arthritis, age 8-16 years, are enrolled in an r and Omized single-blinded trial. Physical function is measured using the child health assessment Question naire. Children with Jia have moderate reduction on bone mass gains, bone turnover, and total lean mass during the disease course. However, there is no significant effect from an aquatic fitness program in children with early arthritis."
27460566,"In this study, we examine the resistance of tooth root to fractures caused by fiber posts. The results indicate that crown placement is superior to other methods of restorative treatment. A three-year clinical trial is performed to assess the effect of different tooth types on the survival of teeth restored with a single post system. Results show that all but two of the teeth in each group fail during the initial period of observation. However, after 84 months, seven replacements fail."
31844350,"This is a first-in-man trial comparing the efficacy of an acute appendicetis regimen with that of omization in children. The results show that patients who receive an initial conservative treatment have fewer complications than those who undergo an outpatient procedure. In addition, there are no major complications in either group. After follow-up, the safety and cost of this approach are established."
24321502,"Prostate-independent men with recurrent or metastatic disease receive either immediate or rogen therapy. After two months, the median time to progress is 6.3 months and the group given derevaline or prednison has a similar effect on overall survival. A further study investigates the effects of delayed testosterone recovery after treatment for prostatecancer. The results suggest that an extended period of time before testosterone recovers may be associated with lower risk of mortality in men without any comorbity. In this study, patients with stage III or IV disease were treated with artificial shincter placement instead of transperial IRT. This trial was designed to determine whether there are any significant differences between the severity of disease and PSA levels at different time points in the disease course. It was found that those who had higher values showed more severe disease than those with less values. However, it was not clear whether these changes were due to increased pain or other causes."
30185438,"Short-term treatment of steroid over the course of three months may suppress the risk of atrial fibrilation recurring in patients with a history of severe atrium fistias. In this study, we report that short- term steroidal therapy is effective in suppressing the frequency of acute attrition after pulmonary vessel isolation. The mean time to complete the procedure is shorter than that of the control group; however, there is no significant difference in the severity of spontaneous or acute erysis after PVI. This study further investigates the use of prednistone as an anti-inflammatory agent for the prevention and resolution of post-catheterablation efficacy. It was found that colchicine, an ""anticion with potent Anti-Inflammatory action,"" could be used to prevent atary fibrillation following pulmonary vein isolation in paroxysmular patients."
30306544,"In this paper, we describe a new approach to determining the importance of changes in quality oflife scores by comparing their to ""global ratings of change"" in order to predict whether or not patients will respond to treatment. The results suggest that monotherapy with TTamsullosin or Tadalafil resulted in significantly and mathematically similar improvements than placebo in lower urinary symptoms. A multi-centre rand and mized trial was performed to investigate the efficacious and the impact upon sexual function of two alpha-A1 blockers with different affinity on the '1A-ar subtypes', tamisuox and naphtopidil. After treatment for each agent, total I PSS, storage Symptom Score, QOL Score and OABS except for the daily frequency were significantly increased from baseline ; after treatment with each Alpha 1-Blocker group, Total I-PsS score, Storage symptom Score/Quality of Life Score had significantly improved from base line. To comparison theefficacy and safetyof two  1A abrenoceptant antagonists with differing affinity for one of the arbourotic subtypologies, Silodosesin and Naftodipil, in treating benign prostatichypoplasia, as well as other benign hyperplusas, is described. This study compares the effects of either 25-75mg w/v of nattomidil or combination therapy with an anticholinessrgic agent: 10 -20 mg/day propiverine hydrogenchloride Or 2 -3 6 Mg per day of Cybutynine hydrochlicide Optimum risk reduction, P =0.002 Countess improvement was significantly reduced when doxazozin was used. Progression was confirmed at least four points in the International Urological Association Sickness Score -- acute Ury retention, urine incontinency, renal insatiability, or reassignment bladder infection -- but no significant differences were observed between the two groups. These studies aim to assess the effect of various drugs on patient response to these treatments."
30953308,"In this study, we examine the relationship between muscular strength and body mass in young adults. Athletics are associated with fasting blood flow and insulin resistance in adulthood. We conclude that youth with lower muscular fitness have a greater risk of remaining at the same level as their peers in later life. This paper is an attempt to understand how physical activity, physical performance, and sociodemography relate to adult health-related characteristics at age 16 and to biological risk factors from childhood onwards. The results suggest that there may be some association between muscle strength among young men and those with higher levels of cardiovascular risk."
31720713,"In this study, we investigate the effects of combined therapy with body weight- supported treadmill training and transcranial directcurrent stimulation on gait recovery in stroke patients. Forty-six patients received a two-week administration of Etidronates. The magnitude of change in vbmd between paretic legs increases within 6 months; with p / 0.007, no significant difference was seen. Affected arm is not significantly different from unaffected arms. Both groups receive calcium and Vitamin D supplementation. Stroke patient may have an increase in the risk of fracture because of weak bone or an increased rate of falling. This study focuses on the relationship between bone mineral denition and bone sorption markers in elderly strokepatients. It shows that there is pronounced loss of bone mass during the first 12 mo after stroke. Bone mineral Denisement in older people with stroke is related to high stroke risk."

The main objective of our review is to describe Methods used to assess quality of prognsis studies. To describe how wellcurrent practice assess potential biaseses."" Prognostics also informs treatment by helping define and describing sub-sections of patients whom may benefit from new treatment or by providing necessary knowledge about the nature of a disease. ""Reference lists of included reviews and method opportune papers"" are searched for articles with an appropriate level of agreement in their assessment of patient reported outcomes. In this paper, we compare parent-reported health-related satisfaction with controls in children aged two - sixteen years with brain tumors. This paper uses the Self-Reporting Quality of Life Questionnaire as another outcome measure. It was found that there was no relationship between self report and parental depressed symptoms. Children with acutely leukemia had better emotional adjustment than those with healthy children. Hypnotism was compared against nonhypnobiotic behavior techniques for improving pain and anxiety among 27 children and teenagers during bone moarrow aspirations and in 22 boys and adolescents during latched puncture. Both groups showed significant differences in pain after intervention. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia was particularly sensitive to pain at the time of surgery. Prior to being treated, pain was significantly reduced when hypnotized."
16867188,"In this study, the incidence and severity of nausea in patients treated with new antidepressive drugs is compared. The numbers of subjects receiving each regimen are as follows: placebo n = 775; duloxitine 40 mg-d, no = 177; paroixetine 20mg-D / 304 ; and prozac vs"
21838650,"This paper presents a checklist of evidence-based treatment outcomes for older adults with anxiety disorder. The most important predictor of short-term treatment is poor perceived health explaining 40 p.e.v. in posttreatment residual gain score on the Hamilton Anxiness Rating Scale and Worry domain Question naire. Short- term treatment results are similar to that of early intervention, but only at one year follow-up. Older adults suffering from generalized anxiety disorders have improved relative to their waiting list. Although Cbt seems to be more effective than brief treatment, it does not provide any support for the inferiority of C Bt to an appropriate comparison intervention."
25913420,"In this paper, we examine the relationship between physical activity and blood-monitoring measures using an accelerometer-reported measure of sitting time and a question-naire-based measure. The results suggest that there are some unfavorable associations between these measures and other risk factors. For example, in patients with type 2 diabetes, spending more time walking is associated with increased fasting blood."
29457570,"The aim of this study is to determine the effect of feeding a pre-biotic infant formula with either polydextrise or galactosaccharidas on the composition of intestinal feceal. In both groups, the concentration of Lactobacteria increases significantly in the addition of these ingredients. A reference group consisting of two hundred thirty infant girls was included. There was not significant difference in number of fever epidemics between thePG and CG; however, there was no significant differences in frequency of outbreaks. The present study assesses the tolerance and safeness of an infant's formula that contains an innovation mixture of OLIGOSACCHARDES in early infatuation. This study compares stool consistency at different levels of gallactoligoscharides to that of control infant milk. Infants who receive the control formula experience softer stool patterns similar to those reported in breast fed infants"
22008401,"After six-minute walk test, patients in the control and intervention groups showed improved lung function after 18 months of follow-up. In this group, a greater number of patients had better results than those in either group. A further study was performed to determine whether incentive spriometry is more effective in preventing post-artifice thrombosis in patients with chronic airway limitation following chest physiotherapies. The results were not statistically significant. However, there were no significant differences in inspiratory volumes or peak pressure during the first two days of the surgery. Furthermore, both groups experienced similar recovery of fetus vaginal stench."
30320723,"In this study, Wuthering Heights demonstrates that the use of pulsed-vein isolation is not necessary for curing atrial fibrilation in patients who have paroxysmal atrium. The ablation procedure using cryoballon or second-generation contact force was associated with better freedom from atary relapse and reduced risk of complications. This study also compares the safety and effectiveness of two different types of abbottance methods for treatment of persistent atarrhythmian thrombosis. Both methods are safe and efficacious; however, there are some drawbacks: the first-three patients report longer exposure to fluoroscopies than the remaining, reporting longer procedures but similar success. Confused nerve palsies were observed in both groups during abration. A comparison between Cryobelloon and second generation cryostablation was made. Phrenic nervepalsy was found in only one group while pulmonary vein isolated was achieved in eighteen % of the patients treated with crying balloon. Conclusions Pulmonary Vein Ablation was an established technique for atarian fibrillation. After ten months, a patient's freeness from arrhythmical complications was comparable to that of single procedure without drugs. At three years follow-up, no significant change was seen in the success rate of either method. Freedom from Arrhythmic Drugs after single operation was equivalent to freedom From Atrial Fibrillation With Comburbined approach was superior to conventional point-by-point RFCA. There were no differences in mid-term outcomes of patients pursuing plenial vein isolation with openirrigated airfrequency catheters."
30397494,"Both exercise regimens result in a significant decline in bloodglucose levels in individuals with Type 1 diabetes. In contrast, the combination of moderate exercise and high intensity exercise results in an improvement in both blood glucose levels. The subjects were divided into 12 type 1 patients and 12 healthy subjects who cycled four times for one hour at constant workload. After each session of exercise, blood concentration was measured continuously by indirectcalorimetry while blood values were checked periodically and oral given cho were calculated. A total amount of cholera was required during moderate exercises but not as much as that required by Type 1, so it was not important to adjust the amounts of insulin needed by the patient. Blood parameters were adjusted daily using indirect caloricmetry throughout the activity while body temperature was assessed periodically"
32242450,"In this study, we report the efficaciousness of fluoxetine for patients with major depressed or OCD who are not under 18 years old. We conclude that it is safe and effective for children and young adults with obsesolate-compulsed disorder to receive either treatment. The results suggests that floxeine is as safe but effective short- term treatment for kids and teenagers with obsessionsive-compulsives disorder. Further studies need to be performed to confirm our findings. A double blinded placebo-controlled trial was conducted in which a combination of buspirone plus olanzepine was used to treat 11 children with tourette's syndrome. After 4 months, no significant differences were observed between treatment groups for symptoms of OCS. This study furthermore provides details on the safety and effectiveness of paroixetine for treating children suffering from obssessively compulsious disorder"
27820540,"The most common stroke risk factors identified by responders were smoking, and stress. A community based telephone interview surveys were conducted in the Sydney Urban area in Australia. This suggests that an educated population may be able to reduce the risk of future strokes and increase the speed of medical presentation after the start of stroke. In this paper, Nir Z uses a telephone survey to assess the level of knowledge among stroke survivors in Hong Kong. Six hundred people correctly identified the Brain as the affected Organ in stroke; those with reassurance of knowing about Stroke were better rated than those without any knowledge. An integrated care program for stroke patients was established. Both groups received two hours education class on Risk reduction post stroke: one group received Rankin Scores, while the other received Education Class on risk reduction Post stroke."" Pretending to be from different patient populations, both groups had significantly improved their health status at three and six months after stroke treatment. After stroke, however, they did not show any significant improvement in functional status or quality of life. Although no significant differences were found between the two camps at entry to studies, at 3and 6 mos before stroke,the intervention group seemed better scores than control group in function status, depression, self-belief, Self-Perceived Health & Selfesteem / and dietaryadherence. These findings suggest that ""at least four fifths"" of recurring vascular events could be prevented by using 'a comprehensive... multifactorial Approach'. More evidence is needed regarding secondary prevention strategies such as physical exercise and weight loss. However, there are still some unanswered questions about stroke disease in Chinese patients who live in communities."
24256847,"In this paper, we describe a prospective study of elderly patients with lung cancer who receive weekly erlotineib and gemcitebine. The results suggest that the combination of these two regimens is highly effective in treating older patients without significant toxicity. We conclude that it is possible to use geriatry assessment to predict survival in older adults with advanced disease."
27820577,"The aim of this study is to determine whether telephony-based case-management will reduce the use of heart failure care in patients who have an advanced form of disease. This trial was a mixed-effects, controlled trial. It showed that there was no difference in hospitalization and readmission rates between the intervention group and the control group at six months' time. In addition, it found that cost savings were realized even after treatment was deducted. A further study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of ""home-base"" or ""robot-monitoring"" for reducing the risk of death from congestive myosmia. After two years, the results were similar: patient satisfaction was improved, blood pressure was reduced, and symptoms were improved."
29478018,"A population-based cohort study is designed to assess the association between Mediterranean diet adherence and total mortality. The results of this study indicate that greater consumption of the Mediterranean lifestyle is associated with reduced risk of all causes of death, particularly for coronary heart diseases. In addition, it is found that higher satiety is related to elevated total tac levels and lower oxidized lethalcholesterol content. This suggests that Mediterranean style diets may be more effective in reducing overall mortality than their European counterparts."
25939649,"Digoxin, a new anti-thrombosis drug, has been shown to be effective in treating heart failure. However, it is unclear whether the drug can work as an angioenzyme blocker when patients receive diuretics or other drugs. In this study, we examine the effect of both digoxiin and placebo on mortality and patient morbidity in patients with severe atrial fibrillation. The main trial was designed to assess the association between dignoxin use and cardiovascular disease. It found that digixn had no effects on all-caluse mortality, admission due any cause, or admission because of cardiovascular causes. This study did not find any differences in survival between women and men who received either treatment."
28560516,"In this study, we compared the safety and efficacy of a novel device called an electric pacer with ventricular paced electrodes in patients with atrial fist-biting. The results suggest that it may be safe for patients to have their first heartbeat controlled by electrode technology during their follow-up. We conclude that these devices are more likely to reduce the risk of death than those without them. After analyzing preprocededural ECGs from the absence of drug, all eligible patients were sorted into four groups based upon the qualile values of PR interval: 166, 182, and 202ms; and were examined according to the Left Atrium Volume, CT, Computed Tomography, and clinical outcomes of ablation. Based on the highest qualid value of pr interval, the oldest quartile had persistent AF/P0.001 or hypertension P=0.051 comparing with the other group. This study was designed to determine whether antiarrhythmical prophylaxes could be used as predictors against early relapses after ARF. It was concluded that the time period between initial abduction and subsequent treatment was sufficient to predict freedom from arrhythmic drugs. Although there was no difference in age, gender, or severity of disease, patient characteristics such as left atrium size, paroxmal flutter, long-sitting aff, etc. were also significant predictores of freedom when analyzed."
20626853,"A doubleblind, paired- comparison study of three p.a.tericin cream and placebo is published. The efficacy in this study was based upon eradication, persistence, superinfecting, or unevalable. In the control group, flucoazole was more effective than either solution. There were 58 patients with 57 different types of pedis infection; the duration of infection did not vary significantly between groups. All patients had complete relief of their pain symptoms after surgery. However, there were some cases of severe dermatitic skin irritations that could not be explained by the medical approach."
14974070,"In this study, we examine the effect of a calcium-supplementation regimen on bone loss in older women. After two years, they observe that the dose of calcium does not alter bone mineral content but rather slows it down. The results are similar to those of other studies. For example, there is no significant change in the spine and forearm at any point during the treatment period. However, when the women are divided into three groups, each group receives either 1,500 or 2000 milligrams of elemental calcium per day. This suggests that both groups may be effective in slowing bone degradation."
29037523,"The psycological diary, the Wi-NRS, is used in two phase III studies of patients with mild to severe chronic psorasis. In these studies, there are no significant differences in response times between groups. A positive content validity of this tool will be further investigated in future studies. Psoriatic diseases such as rheUMAtoid and plaque recurrent disease have also been studied. These conditions are autoinflammatory, and they are frequently associated with skin inflammation. This study assesses whether the patient's symptoms are respondable to the treatment of either type of disease. It was found that those with moderate or severe PP had more days lost at work than those without a worse condition. HAQDI scores were calculated by means of visual analog scales and separate VAS measures for joints and skin. PSA score was influenced by extent of skin involvement."
19370677,"Dronabolol is an effective anti-anorexia drug that has few side effects. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 11 patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease concludes that it may be useful for treating symptoms and improving behavior in some patients."
25668264,"In this study, we examine the effect of blood pressure reduction on patients with hypertensively drained blood. The results are similar to those obtained in other studies. For example, lossartan is more effective than amiloride in reducing myocardial infa-rct Ion, stroke, or death. Furthermore, it is reported that captoprile reduces all causes of mortality and major complications in people with Type 2 diabetes. This suggests that treatment with an antihypertensionant may be as effective for preventing these events as conventional therapy."
27836071,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of exercise and manual therapy to treat neck pain in patients who have persistent whiplash-related symptoms. He uses a case-control study to examine the effect of an eight-week course of physical therapy with isometric stretching and cupping massage on patients suffering from chronic non-sensical neck discomfort. The results suggest that these treatments are more effective than conventional exercises for treating neck injuries. Anderson concludes by comparing the effectiveness of two different types of treatment: ""mild mechanical Neck pain"" and ""non-specific neck painfulness."" His main aim is to determine whether either group can be used as predictors against other groups' results."
27071989,"This study focuses on the use of neurocognition testing in concusses to determine whether there is a significant difference in performance between concoussed and control groups. The results suggest that concurssions are more likely to cause symptoms than they are to be associated with other causes of injury. A comparison of pre- and Post-concupsion scores on Immediate post-consulsion assessment and Cognitive Testing, ImPACT version 2.0, was used to examine neuropsychological function and symptoms in patients who had been involved in an accident. In addition, this study uses case-control analysis to assess the effect of repeated head injuries on youth ice skating players."
25452221,"Enteral feeding is associated with reduced risk of necrotizing ostomy scarlet fever but no changes in the risk from enteral-fed infants. In this study, we examine the effect of early enterals feeding on bowel tolerance and growth after 385 prematurely born infant girls. The results suggest that early feeds are more effective in preventing nosocomic scarlets than intermittent orogatric feeding. We conclude that these studies have important implications for improving health care for children at all stages of development."
27483307,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective, observational study on the effects of an eight-week Mediterranean diet on patients with type 2 diabetes. We examine the association between the Med diet and the L-FibC diet in terms of the risk of developing Type 2 disease."
27842225,"This study focuses on the effects of a self-care education intervention on patients with heart failing. The results suggest that this intervention can improve quality of life, physical function, and anxiety in patients who have had an elective chest surgery. A nurse-led approach is shown to be more effective than usual care in improving patient health. In addition, it reduces the risk of readmission by reducing the need for frequent hospital visits."
22889860,"This study focuses on the relationship between patient-reported fatigue and parent-patient reports of fatigue in children with adolescent cancer. The results suggest that patients experience more difficulties with fatigue during the first days of their treatment than before. In addition, there are other important changes in the severity of these symptoms. For example, patients report greater fatigue when their parents report less energy or difficulty swallowing. A second study is designed to assess the efficacy of an exercise intervention for children who have been receiving treatment for acutemyeloid leukemia. It was found that sleep was more effective in this group than in control groups."
29627967,"The aim of the study is to determine whether exercise training for patients with chronic claudication can improve walking ability. In this study, we examine changes in heart rate and activity after six months of vigorous walk training as compared with control groups. We conclude that there are no significant differences in peak walking times or duration between groups; however, it is possible that some form of exercise may alter these results. A group-mediated home-based Walking Education program improves functional performance in patients who have intermittent clamoring pain but does not significantly change their walking capacity. This study further investigates the effect of an exercise program designed specifically for people with peripheral arteries disease on physical function. It was found that ""no significant changes were seen at 6 month follow-up"" in both walking time and distance. However, improvement in quality of life was also observed in those with persistent boweldication. These patients received a controlled exercise regimen consisting of two training sessions per week followed by one daily session. They showed improved walking speed and increased blood flow during the first three months. Furthermore, they demonstrated improvements in walking power and lengthening walking intervals when supervised exercise was used. Both exercises had similar effects on walking abilities and qualityof life."
19821358,"A prospective cohort study involving patients with a history of genital Warts and Vulvodynis who had been attending Manly sexual health service from March to July 2000 found that the use of probiotics was superior to antibiotics in preventing recurrent outbreaks. In addition, Lactobacilus acidophilous is more effective in treating BV than other anti-viral treatments. Women with vaginala irritation, discharge, and fishy smelling were more likely to develop bacterial vulvonic disease. This treatment showed significant improvement in both women's condition and their satisfaction with it."
30273409,"Pregnant women who received a pre-natal yoga intervention showed lower depression than those in the control group. This study supports the notion that early-life exercise may be an effective treatment for depressed patients. In this paper, we report on the efficacy of light exercise and vigorous exercise on post-partum depression. The results suggest that moderate exercise is more effective than intense exercise in improving symptoms of major depressive disease. A pilot study was conducted to compare the effect of regular physical activity on anxiety and mood during pregnancy. It found that both groups had greater reductions in depression scores than controls. However, there was no significant difference between changes on depression score after controlling for baseline. Furthermore, it was observed that repetitive negative thoughts were an important predictor of affective disorders."
29185808,"Curcumins are a potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiviral agent that may help to prevent or treat atherogenic hyperlipidemia in patients with Type 2 Diabetes. In this study, we examine the efficacious effects of curcuin on blood lipid concentrations as well as inflammation in subjects suffering from type 2 diabetes. We conclude that curcummins might be useful for treating these conditions because it reduces pulse wave velocity, increases leptinate activity, decreases fat content, improves blood sugar levels, regulates glyceric acid absorption, lowers lipoprotein Lipase activity by promoting oxidative defense against disease. This study is designed to evaluate the effect ofcurcumn on serum levels of various cytokines and mediators including IL-1A, il-1, IFN1, Efg, MCP 1 & TNF. The results of the current trial suggest that curlcuminoidas reduce systemic odor burden in people sufferingfrom knee Ostearthritis. There was significant elevation in Serum SOD activities; borderline significant Elevation in GSH concentrates; and reduction in Malonedialde Hyde concentration: mean change: 2.49 / 2.78 compared with 1.62. p ="
31284372,"The primary end point of this study is fatigue. In the intervention group, patients had a longer average total and post-opportunity length of stay than the controls. This was due to the fact that patients with lung disease were at greater risk for postoperative complications because of their poor lung health and cardiorespitory endurance. A second trial evaluates whether adding exercise before lung surgery to improve fitness in patients who have risk factors for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications can be used to reduce the risk of complications. Another trial compares an eight-week exercise regimen with conventional resistance training in advanced lung diseases. These results suggest that short-term exercise may be more effective in improving physical performance in elderly patients after thoscotomy."
25572192,"In this study, the safety and effectiveness of IV iron surose in patients with severe anemia was compared to that of either oral or Intravenously iron sucrose. The results were similar in severity and severity for both groups. A further study is presented on the efficaciousness of ferric-carboxymetose as a preventive treatment for acute myeloid disease. This paper concludes that it is possible to use iron dextran instead of transfusion therapy in order to reduce blood loss during pregnancy, labor, and post-delivery."
25428524,"In this study, the effects of a combination of testosterone and dutastesteride on body mass, strength, sexual function, and urination are examined. The results indicate that men with low levels of both testosterone and DHT have improved their health. Men with higher levels receive more T than those with lower levels; however, they do not show any significant changes in quality of life. This study is an attempt to determine whether or not treatment with either placebo or T improves physical function in patients with high-risk heart disease. It was found that there were no significant differences in bone mineral denition or muscle mass between the two groups. However, it was noted that blood concentrations increased significantly in the TTT group. A further study was performed to assess the safety of using transdermal patches as replacement therapy for hypogonal men who had low amounts of dihydrotene."

The reduction was 13 p.m. for placebo and 44 pp. M. A. R. O.M. This work examines the effect of topical anti-inflammatory drug on cyclical mammography. It shows that it has no side effects but does not cause any serious sideeffects. Women suffering from mastalgic disease often experience symptoms such as breast tenderness, pain, and noddingularity. After four months' treatment by topically applied Afimixfene results in statisticallysignificant improvements in signs or symptoms of cyclical masttalgiA across patient-and physician-ratedscales with excellent toleranceability and safety; P = 0.0012 ""pain"". Although there are few sidesigns, all are insignificant. For women who have disturbed their mastality, smoking and stress may be associated with these problems. Perimentstrual breast discomfort is common in women under 35 years old. Many agents have been used to treat this condition. Some have shown great efficacy in treating mastulgis. However, some have had side affects including dizziness and menstruals irregularities. These studies were performed at different time intervals according to an ardized regimen."

We conclude that repeated treatments are safe and efficacious in treating these patients."
17054170,"In this paper, Dr. Parks and his colleagues describe the use of a new surgical technique to treat patients with chronic acute analfissure. The conventional treatment is solitary lumbar puncture; however, in this new technology, it is possible to achieve greater pain relief by using electrodes placed directly on the patient's neck. This new approach allows for more rapid healing than traditional surgical methods. After seven weeks, the symptoms are completely healed in 15 patients who receive Ismn, 67 percent with GTN, and 30 percent from the placebo-controlled group. A further study was performed to compare the effects of local nitrogelic oinment with that of cryothermal Anal Dilators. Results were not significant, but statistically significant: three patients in the control group had an al burning. Thereafter, 36 patients divided into two sets of groups to undergo treatments with 0.25%) GTT or ""Had"". These studies aim to determine whether HDA will be considered able to cure chronic anally fissure as well as any other type of disease. It is concluded that HD would be suitable for treating such patients."
26793356,"After a four-week washout, we compare the effects of vasartan with an analosterone blocker in 131 patients with pulse wave velocity. The effect of both treatments is not correlated. Aortic stiffening and central blood pressure are also not affected by either treatment. Renin Angiotensine system may play some role in Vascular aging. Thirtying five healthy elderly subjects was rand ommed to valstaan or placebo before baseline testing for Pulwave velocity, Ax@Hr75, and Brachial ankle vascular index. There were no differences in brachially BP changes, bcfPwv, AIx atHR75 or center psue, but there were more favorableAIx effects with losartans than with carvedill. In this study, it is revealed that increased systelic blood flow leads to left heart hypertrophy, while reduced diastopic blood demand results in diminished coronary circulation. Two antihypertinesive regimens were studied: one group was treated with arachid blockers; the other was given only irbersolate. It was reported that these two drugs have beneficial effects on arterial rigidness. Both groups showed similar changes in mean blood force after six weeks of treatment except for albuminuria which was significantly reduced. This study concludes that long term use of an anion-converting enzyme inhibitor reduces blood vessel stiffness as well as increases the serum amonectin known as an ""adipocotkine."" However, there is limited evidence regarding the efficacy of these three compounds."
26358358,"The results of this study suggest that a low-flora diet may be an advantageous intervention for patients with nonalcoholic fat liver disease. Twenty-four healthy men aged 21-25 years were randomly assigned to either high-sugar or fructoses as the main source of their energy. After four weeks, there was little change in body weight and blood lipid concentrations in either group. Fifteen hyperintensic men consumed two different diets: one consisting of cornstarch and one composed of fruit juice. In the control group, consumption of sugar increased fasting and postpran and ieal plasma triacelglyceride concentration but did not affect fastering or postprior and Ial Plasma triacylgluceration. This study suggests that adding more sugar to your diet can improve heart disease risk by reducing levels of both circulating and secretion-cholesterol."
18197978,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach for evaluating the efficacy of combined treatment with multimodal psychological intervention in children with hyperactive disorder. They report significant improvement in symptoms and behavior over two years after initial treatment. For example, children who receive both treatment and community-based care show superior improvements in social and family functions than those who are given only medication management. The authors conclude that ""the practical clinical trials"" model is an effective method to assess the effectiveness of various treatment approaches in reducing or resolving symptoms of patients with different types of mental illness."
28492950,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed description of the different cannanbinols and their effects on human subjects. They suggest that they may be useful as predictors of changes in brain function after treatment with THC. For example, rats show improved performance at higher doses than those given to healthy volunteers. A four-waycrossover study includes 24 men who smoke two to nine cigarettes per month. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the dose of TAC contained in cannabis smoking and the effects of mental health. This study was conducted using rats, mice, rabbits, and humans. Both drugs showed similar results in laboratory animals. However, there were no significant differences between them either in man or in the laboratory animal. There were not qualitative differences among both drugs neitherin man nor inthe laboratory creatures. Healthy participants were assigned to receive either placebo or 200mg of CBN alone. Post-thc paranoia was less in CBD group comparing with the placebo groups. community-based studies suggested that cannabis products High-dose oral Cbd could exert calming effects for social anxiety disorders, insomnia, epilepsy, but also so it may cause mentally sedation"
29684790,"Back pain sufferers have a reduced range of motion in their hips and torso. This is due to the fact that they have straight leg raises, which lead to increased movement between the two parts of the body. The study also investigates whether people with back pain reduce the variability of movement across the trunk and spine at different speeds. Thirteen subjects with low back Pain and sixteen healthy controls participate in this study. In addition, studies have been performed on the effects of walking speed on both the lower and the upper thorac region. These studies are important because they provide information about the relationship between these two regions."
29760482,"In this study, we examine the effects of sweeteners on blood glucose levels in elderly subjects who have normal tolerance for glucose. The results suggest that sweetened drinks may be more effective in reducing blood sugar than sucrose or artificial sweetners. We also examine changes in memory performance after a high-dose of aspartamie, which has been reported to decrease smoking."
31266163,"In this study, we compare the performance of two different cements -- RelyX U100 and RXU E -- in a single-step cementation system. The results indicate that both systems are highly effective at bonding dentin. However, there is still some uncertainty regarding the long- term stability of these newer cement types. For example, when used with self-etch technology, it is found that the final product fails by as much as three times its cost."

27590729,"This is a small, well-controlled study to evaluate the effect of daily consumption of bread in patients with tidbits of disease. The results suggest that probiotic bread may have some beneficial effects on both blood lipid levels and liver function. In this study, sixty-four patients aged 18-75 years with non-alcoholic stench were assigned to either control bread or kefir for eight weeks. Both groups had no significant changes in their waist and circumferences. A further study was performed to investigate the efficacy of metformin alone or with an added strain of Lactobacilus Gasseri on liver amino transferases after fasting. It was found that the aspartate glutagon-likepeptide activity did not significantly reduce the serum ALT level but rather increased it considerably. These results warrant further investigation into the use of yeast extract in treatment of heptoma."
29439755,"Pre-post testing of telemedicine appeared to increase patients' willingness to take control of their disease. The decision aid also seemed to improve patient efficacy, adherence, and patient perceptions about the intervention mode. However, the mechanism for the effect was not clear. Knowledge scores improved among the high-intelligent intervention group, while upon further analysis we found the intervening effect not meditated by gain in knowledge. In contrast, our intervention did not seem to be mediated by gains in knowledge. This study evaluates the efficaciousness of an outpatient home health program to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease in patients with multiple conditions. Although the results were mixed, they showed significant reductions in blood pressure, total cholesterol, hypertension, mean change in process composite, as well as improvements in quality of life. Acutely ill patients who had received a remote self-management course reported better outcomes than those who received usual care. Furthermore, this treatment resulted in reduced levels of haemoglobin, which was significantly reduced in the Diabetes Care group from baseline until 6 and 12 month. Conclusions Telehealth effectively createsaccess to successfully conduct one year remote dsme by / nurse Cde and dietitians that improved metabolic controls and reduced cardiovascular risks in ethnically diverse or rural population."
31763928,"In this doubleblind, placebo-control study, a combination of red yeast rice, phytosteroids, and lytyrosol is shown to improve blood pressure, endotolhelial function,and arterial stiffness among 60 patients with Polygenic hypercholestrerolemia. The results suggest that the combined nutriceutical compound, Pycnicol, can be used as an anti-cancer agent in reducing aging-related risk factors."
29350873,"In this study, we examine the pain response of 40 healthy volunteers to heat and cold painful thresholds in order to determine whether these predictors can be used to predict postoperative pain. We conclude from a pooled analysis of 100 patients that there are no independent clinically relevant predicters for post-opportunity after total knee surgery. A significant association between height and weight was found among both age and pain severity. This study investigates whether Mulligan's mobilizing with movement improves torsiflexion and relieves ankle spriin in primary care. The results suggest that using MWM as an intervention may lead to improved patient satisfaction."
25631639,"Pregnant women in the United States were randomed to receive either a daily dose of 4000 IU of vitaminD or placebo throughout pregnancy. The trial was designed to examine whether prenatal intervention could prevent the development and severity of asthma in women's off-spring. After four years, the odds of an emergency department visit for children with severe asthma were not significantly increased when compared to controls who received no treatment. In addition, blood concentrations of both 25 th and calcitonin were lower in black Americans than in whites. A prospective study was conducted to determine whether exposure to excessively high maternal levels of 25hV might lead to adverse effects on the child. It was concluded that this risk was due to maternal consumption of high concentrationof 25HV at birth. However, it was found that there was no significant association between serum 25 HV and the risk of acute asthma attack."
22142898,"In this paper, Wu et al. describe the effect of iron on children with iron deficient anemia. He concludes that iron treatment is preferable to other forms of treatment because it can be used as a preventive strategy. The results of this study suggest that combined iron andzine supplementation may be useful in treating iron-detained anemic infantile children. A doubleblind, randomed, placebo-control trial was performed in which 680 Indonesian children were assigned to either daily iron or placebo for 3 mo. This intervention showed significant improvement in blood iron concentration and learning achievement among iron desolate anestemias. No significant changes were seen in anthropometry or complete blood count between the two group after the 3 months of observation. Four studies investigated effects of Iron on cognition; one examined boys and girls age 5 - 8, while the other studied boys aged 6  -- 8 y who had no iron deficiencies. These studies included four different groups of children: 1) iron pretreatment, 2)iron depleted adults, and 3)Iron-replete analized children"
26558494,"In this study, the effects of light therapy on patients with winter affective disorder are compared. The results suggest that light treatment can be effective as an acute treatment for depression in susceptible patients. However, there is no significant difference between the severity of depressed symptoms and the duration of treatments. A prospective randomised doubleblind placebo-controlled trial was conducted to determine whether bright light could prevent the reoccurrence of major depression during the autumn and winter months. It was found that bright white light had a greater effect than antidepressants in terms of reducing the frequency of severe depressive episodes."
25643669,"In this study, we examine the effect of a single daily dose of vitamin D in children with asthma and food sensitization. We conclude that there is no increased risk of disease from taking more than one serving of the recommended amount of whole-wheat or water-soluble vitamins during the first two years of life compared with receiving only one portion of these same nutrients in peanut oil. Children who receive both forms of treatment have remarkably similar health outcomes after four years"
25807223,"In this paper, the authors report that among 129 patients with persistent atrial fist-fighting who had been treated for heart failure with a high likelihood of ""tachycara-mediated"" LV dysfunction, they found no improvement in their left ventricular functions after three or six months of resection. They conclude that ablation is an effective and safe treatment for these patients. A recent study suggests that there may be some benefit in using pericardials to treat atrium fibrillation in patients suffering from heart failing. The authors present ten studies on the use of cathter-based therapy for treating paroxysmal atarrhythmia. These studies suggest that it is possible to improve left ventricle function in such patients without significant complications."
24474283,"The aim of these studies is to compare the effect of Emodain on periodontal defect gain as an addition to modified flap surgery with a combination of enamel matrix derivatives and surgical intervention. In this study, patients are assigned to either control or test groups for defects associated with deep inflamed lesions. Both groups show significant gains in terms of bone gain and pocket depth after 12 months. Emdogiin has been shown to be more effective than placebo in treating deep-infrabonies. A further study is performed to evaluate the effects of embagin versus other anti-inflammatory agents in treatment of periodotal defects. This study results in improved attachment gain by 6 months and reduction in pockets depth by 1 year."
29770953,"In this study, we examine the effects of physical activity on prostate cancer survivors. Among those not meeting the guidelines at baseline, UCAN increased patriotism by 52 minutes and improved quality of life by 15 minutes. We conclude that ""internet-delivery"" may be able to reduce the cost of such an intervention among older Nova Scotian men. The results are similar to those reported in other studies. A matched strength training program was found to be effective for improving physical function and mental health in patients with multiple types of malignancies."

The mean reduction in parallel width, perpendicaular width and depth of largest defect around the implants are measured clinically just after placing and 3 months afterwards at the apothecary's surgery. In the De group, there is a significant reduction over time; however, it is statistically significant that the margins of each implant are reduced by as much as 24 mm. Purpose This one-year prospective study evaluates the success rate, periimplant tenderness, and escort outcome of immediately place and provisionalize maxillary posterior single implants."" At the 12 month follow-up, two implants fail: ""Immediate group"", 8 %; and ""Delayed group,"" 4 p.m. After four years, all implants remain in function.

24369149,"In this study, we report that changes in blood concentrations induced by the GnRh agonist and testosterone are associated with changes of fat-free masses, muscle size, strength and powers, fat mass, hemoglobine, high-dental lipoprotein levels, and Igf-I levels. We conclude that change in circulatingtester concentration is associated to testosterone dose-and concentration-dependent increasesin fat free mass, Muscle size ; strength or power,""fat mass""."" The effect of testosterone on platelet expression is not yet established. Acute steroid treatment does not improve insulin resistance in patients with Type 2 diabetes. However, it does improve body composition and reduces blood pressure. This study further investigates the effects of long-term treatment on elderly patients who have chronic heart failure."
30215045,"The Swedish register of gallstone surgery and ercps has reached 75 percent national coverage in the past year. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of routine prophylactic antimicrobials for patients who are not receiving antibiotics during elective or emergency laparoscopic-cholecychstectomy. We find that there is no significant difference between the rates of superficial surgical site infection and deep syphilis among the groups with no pretreatment. A meta-analysis was conducted on the results of a controlled trial on using propropylaxis to prevent surgical wound infection in low risk women. There was an incidence of two %) in infection complications at surgical sites. No significant differences existed within the two groups; age ranged from eleven to 70 years; body massindex was 32 kg/m2, and mean age was 45. Nineteen consecutive LCs as emergencies were performed. Only one minor complication occurs: an abcess inthe presence of bleeding leak. Antibiotic treatment does not seem effective in preventing post-operative infections. Post-opportunity infectious complications occurred in both groups. Prophylus seems not necessary in lower-risk patients having electives la paroscopic cholencystictomies."
24076079,"The results of a two-year, randomized, controlled trial suggest that supervised, hospital-founded exercise regimens are more effective than home-based exercises for improving walking ability in patients with peripheral arterial disease. In this study, the changes in walking time and cadence were similar to those of the other two groups; however, they were greater with home basis exercise. This is an important finding because it suggests that there may be some benefit in using group-medicated behavior to improve walking performance in people with paternal artery disease such as intermittent  Claudication."
26679430,"The primary endpoint of the study was a change in the score on the Hamilton Depression Rating scale from baseline to final treatment. This was not found to be superior to placebo, but it was more favorable for patients with major depression who had previously failed to respond to one course of syphilis or another. Adverse effects were less frequent than those seen with other antipsychotics. In this study, vortitioxenetine is shown to have significant improvements in both mental and physical function in adults aged 18-75 years with an established major depressive disease. Although there are no significant differences between the two groups, the main efficacy outcome was change on Madras-Asscoberg Depression Score at week 8; after adjustment for multiplicity, changes were greater with villegondetine than with placebo."
30104184,"This paper focuses on the use of machine learning to predict patients' mood, emotions, and other health-related features from phone calls. It is shown that voice features are more accurate in the prediction of manic and mixed states than those of depressed patients."
18554425,"Iron absorption from tests meals was evaluated using erythreocyte incorporation. Conclusions Ascorbicace and Na2edta did not differ significant in their boosting effects on iron Absorption at mololar ratios between 0.6: 1 to 0.7;1 relative tofortification iron The test meals contained 14 mg of added Fe as ferrous soy sauce, including 2.0 / 2.6m 58fe or 4) 7.0 Mg 57Fo. Children with or without anemia received iron fortified breakfasts in Peru. Morbidness from Urtitis, the numberof gastrointestinal infections, and compliance are recorded every two wk. Iron supplementing significantly improved iron levels by increasing hemogloin and serum Ferritin. In children who had or were without infection, they gained better iron status through increased hemoglobin concentrations than controls. Fortification improves both men and women's stores of Fe. Women with initial ida benefit most from this treatment. A double-blinded study is designed to evaluate the efficaciousness of iron-rich fish sauce in combatting iron deficiencies in pregnant women. Premenophausal women, multipara females -- women with prolonged pregnancy -- and mothers with severe anesthesia benefit more from fortenification than control subjects. Fortifying reduces the severity of Anemia but does not increase the frequency of symptoms among males. Two studies have been performed to determine the effect of fortes on blood iron absorbance. One study has found that salt phytate inhibits iron absorbtion while the other has shown a strong effect on it. Both methods have no significant differences in the prevalence of deficiencies. However, one strategy for improving iron stores is for fortable foods such as wheat rolls. This approach is highly effective in reducing iron deficientiency in people ages 5 to 10 years."
19885644,"In this study, we examine the effects that rest breaks and stretches have on workers' symptoms. The results of the two-year post-intervention period are marked by decreases in risks of work injuries, loss time injury, and injury without three or more day of time loss. A participatory worker management ergonomics team has been shown to reduce total lost days from 136.2to 23.0 annual per 100 fulltime workeréquivalents. This study also investigates the effect of a participative worker-management exercise team among hospital orderslies. Workers alternate between conventional schedules and an alternate schedule in four weeks intervals; they report pain reductions for several areas of their body and eyestrain. After the intervention, both groups report improvements in chair comfort, lighting conditions, headaches, fatigue, stress, neck pain, upper back pain as well as pain disability. Both groups respond positively to the program. For example, subjects reported less shoulder discomfort after the first six weeks of training than during the previous six months. However, there were no significant differences in average scores from pre to follow-up. Two different prevention programmes were studied: 1) individual design / physical training program ; 2) work place stress management & 2) control group. These studies suggest that ""personal preventive"" exercises can improve spine and upper extremity problems for workers who used VDTs methods. They include patients with neck and shoulder complaints but do not show any difference in severity at all. Their health status is improved when they take regular breaks while performing physical exercises. There was improvement in self-reporting recovery over the course of 12 months following the treatment. To compare early intervention with standard care in managing Worker's Compensation claims, Hamilton suggests that employees may be able to improve their health and workstyle habits based on one-on-one practice. He concludes that it is unlikely that employers will use medical treatment before these changes are implemented."
26381811,"In this study, we examine the effects of a novel combination of methphetamine and modafinill on brain function in healthy volunteers. We find no significant changes in mood or body symptoms after 7 days of treatment, but there are some improvements in performance during the first two weeks. This is due to the fact that modselective drug induces faster learning than placebo; however, it does not improve memory or short-term recall."
20351229,"A recent study suggests that the long-term outcome of patients with Type I and Type II Type 2 despite improved outcomes in the past may be due to improvements in contrast material used during surgery. In this paper, we report the results of a prospective observational study of 2725 patients who had undergone conventional caBG for two years. The rate of complications was similar to that of controls; however, the incidence of acute renal failure was greater in those with type I or Type 2, as compared to those without such conditions. Postoperative complications were particularly significant in patients treated with radical scysmobarbite. This study also reports on the relationship between perioperative blood levels and the risk of infection. It is found that both types of disease are associated with increased mortality."
24708875,"Four groups of subjects were matched with demographic characteristics and intelligentness. The methadone, control, and non-opiate- dependent groups tested their performance on gambling tasks. They found no significant differences in GT performance between the three groups but that they had more failures than those who did not smoke. At older age, social environment appears to play an increasing part in children's intellectual development. A prospective open cohort study was conducted in which 723 patients received treatment from a single primary care institution during 1990 / 2005. In this study, we examined the effect of maternal cigarette use on birth weight. We found that maternal third-thirmester smoking was the strongest prediction of birthweight percentile; partial r equaled -0.23 p .001. This Norwegian prospect ive ve cohort studies of children pre Natally exposed to drugs under conditions of little postpartum social risk. Pregnancy outcomes included preterm birth, small forgestational age or neonathal unit admission. Buprenorphino remained an alternative treatment after these studies. There were no other primary or second outcomes or in any of the rates of Ma or Neonata adverse events. However, prenatal drug exposure was associated with mild developmental retardation in both groups. Mild depressive symptoms were also present in the first two years of pregnancy."
31948489,"In this study, we aim to identify risk factors for patients' adherence to treatment. We examine the frequency of patients who fail to adhere to their medication and determine whether these factors are associated with future nonadherence. This is a prospective observational study that focuses on finding predictors among patients in order to improve long-term patient outcome."
29474541,"In this study, we examine the effect of three different bonding agents on enamel surface. The first agent is a light-bonding agent, while the second is an enamel-modified cement. After debondring, there are significant cracks in all groups. This study also compares the shear strength of two different types of orthodontic attachments to that of one of the other three. It is concluded that the use of these new methods will increase the amount of enamel damage after debating."
29988399,"In this double blinded, rat-controlled study, the safety andefficacy of risperdone in patients with bipolar is not demonstrated. A significant improvement was noted on the young mania rating scale as a result of both treatment groups. The most important side effects were headache and nausea. Both studies showed no significant differences in survival time or adverse events. However, neither group showed any significant change in mood symptoms or psychosocial functioning during the follow-up period."
30135848,"This study focuses on the effects of two-step, self-etching cements on dentin. Adhesion is more frequent in Cement Stability Aggregates when used in combination with two step, or no adhesive. The results suggest that this type of cement will be more effective in treating lesions with an extended period of time. Thirty patients were divided into three groups: IB, CCS, and CSb. At 18 months, retention was significantly lower for the IA group than for other groups. In addition, the clearfil S3 bond improved the performance of these materials by improving the patient's response to treatment."
21898039,"The aim of this study is to assess whether the analogue form of desmino 8 darginine-vasopressedin is safe and efficacious in the treatmentof nocturnals in elderly patients. After two weeks of placebo-controlled studies, desmopsin was found to be more effective in treating noxious urgencies than placebo. A double blinded, crossover study was carried out on elderly men with naivete who received either drug for three weeks. In this trial, there was no significant change in blood concentration or urine volume between the two groups; however, after a week's washout period, both groups received despopressin. This study also examined the safety and effectiveness of low-dose desmolpressing in older patients with benign Prostatichypoplasia. There were no serious side effects during the study. However, it was noted that some patients had mild adverse events. For example, one patient had severe hyponatrialemia but did not experience any other side effect. Another patient experienced only mild symptoms while receiving dempolining medication."
22643828,"The goal of this project is to establish a school for teaching the art of hernital repair, and to develop an EHs school in which patients can learn tips and tricks on how to perform these procedures. In addition, the aim will be to improve the quality of care provided by surgeons in Denmark. A prospective study was conducted to determine the predictors of long-term complications after open or laparoscopic surgery. It was found that older age and higher mental component score were associated with greater risk of short- term complications. For electives repairs, only 57 % of treated patients had local anesthetic. However, no national studies have been carried out on the subject."
31165921,"The results of this study suggest that DBT-a is an effective intervention for reducing self-harm, suicidedal ideations, and depression among adolescents with repetitively self harming behavior. Although the use of sleep medication has been associated with lower response rates in combination therapy, it is not clear whether these patients are susceptible to abuse history or hopelessness. In addition, young people who have more comoresbid disorders may be less likely to benefit from CBT than those who receive only one type of treatment. This paper also discusses the effect of age and gender differences on the efficability of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in children and Adolescence. It was found that although there were no significant differences between the two groups, they had similar effects on depressive symptoms. For example, when compared to fluoxetine, remit was much higher in both groups. However, as previously reported, ""experience avoidance, acting with awareness,"" and acceptance were seen to be highly linked to changes in depressed patient's psyche. These studies provide further evidence that CBTT can be used to treat treatment-responsive depression in older adults."
24123837,"The bond strength of two different types of resin cements are compared in this study. In the control group, no surface treatments increase the bonding strength; in the heat-aged group and the thermal-aging group both treatment methods result in higher bond strengths. Abrasion results in increased shear bond values for both resins. Adhesion failures occur most frequently. Bonding is improved by airborne-polypowder abraded surfaces. Coating with an alumnia coat improves herar bonds to Zirconia. This study examines the influence of three different surface conditions on the performance of self-etchable resin composites: BisCeme, DuoLink, and Panavia AllCceram. These studies determine whether or not the effects of these various surfacetreatments can be used to improve the quality of the final product."
17667645,"The results of a number of studies suggest that exercise and risk-factor reduction over four years will significantly reduce the severity of coronary heart diseases in men and women. In particular, there are no significant differences in the rate of progress of atheroses among patients assigned to usual or multifactor risks reduction. A recent study suggests that vigorous physical exercise may improve myocardially perfusion but does not lead to improvement in other endpoints. This study also reports that an intervention with lifestyle changes can prevent severe atheroesis after only one year without using lipid-reducing drugs. However, it is concluded that this program has little overall survival impact."
30329174,"This is a prospective, i.e. single-blind, random-experimental study designed to compare efficacy and safety of two different anti-ocular agents in the treatment of patients with or without underlying mucinous disease. The results indicate that aloever vera can safely be used as an effective adjuvant for treating patients who have severe or persistent musculosis."
17443609,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of surgical drainage in elective and laparoscopic patients. He describes two groups of patients: 1) patients who are drained without drains; 2) patients with closed suction or passive tube drainage; and 3) patients that have either no drain or a drain with an air-vent tube. The results of the study indicate that both types of drainage are safe and can be performed safely. Although there is some disagreement about the merits between these two different methods, it is concluded that they are appropriate for all patients regardless of age, weight, and other measures of health."
14870716,"The functional status of the elderly is compared over a 10-month period. ADL scores decline significantly in the two groups, particularly hip and mobility. The Functional fitness for long-term care program was designed to not only maintain ROM, but also improve strength, balance,flexibility,mobility, and function. Cost savings were found for the program. In the Dyna Posturography study, the training group improved their equilibrium score in three most difficult test circumstances. All persons age 70 through 75 year olds in Swedish community were asked to participate in an eight-week balance training study. Out of 15 interested subjects, 15 were selected at rand and ommized for pt/OT sessions or friend visits. These patients received no significant improvement in overall physical disability Index, Sickiness Impact Profile, or activity of daily living Scores. This trial examined the effects of seated exercise on older women with 3.2+ /-1.9 chronic diseases. It was concluded that even very elderly people could benefit from regular exercise because they are more likely to be physically independent than those who do not have any health problems. They showed that high intensity exercise can result in improvements in postural stability, muscular endurance, gait speed, cadency, weight training, ankle strength and walking speed. Sixteen nursing home residents completed this study; all had good results. Only one patient died from unrelated medical problems due to injury or lack of interest in exercise."
27006144,"Sampling is a method used to assess the effects of drug use on driving performance. In this study, twenty healthy volunteers were given two treatment conditions: dl-methamhetamine at 0.4mg/kg and placebo. The results suggest that the sfsts are not as effective in detecting low levels of methamphamine as they should be; however, it is concluded that these drugs do not impair drivers' ability to drive."
22094998,"In this paper, we examine the effects of a lottery-based incentive program on smoking cessations in patients who are not currently using methadone. We find that the odds of winning 'a prize' are much higher than those of other treatment regimens. This is due to the fact that prizes are often small and large. The results of this study suggest that incentives may be an effective strategy for decreasing maternal tobacco use during pregnancy. Fetal outcomes were evaluated by serial ultrasound exams performed during the fourth trimester. Pregnancy participants were assigned either ""contingent"" or ""nonconsent."" They were then given either vouchers or control treatments. After 12 weeks, they were randomly assigned to either community reinforcement approach or contingency treatment. These conditions consisted of: 1) Community reinforcement approaches with cash transfers; 2) contingent tokens; and 3) controls. Results from 180 cocaine-dependent women were divided into two conditions: one condition treated with community reinforce approaches and another condition subjected to control intervention. Both conditions had significant differences in abstinencing rates. A period spent early in the treatment was associated With significantly greater oddsof posttreatment abstainance. There was no evidence of difference between the two treatment conditions in any regard. Vouchers were earned independently of smoking status."
29119235,"In this study, a total of 67 patients were divided into three groups: Bifdobacterum longum with ""fos"" and lifestyle modification; diet and exercise; and the lifestylemodulation alone group. The results showed significant differences between the two groups in the following measures: AST 69.6, LDL cholesterol 70.84, CRP 2.9, and TNF-A 0.45. This study was designed to investigate the effects of probiotic treatment on liver function tests in patients with chronic nonalcoholic fatty disease. Both groups received an energy balanced diet as well as physical activity recommendations. After 12 weeks, both groups improved their renal profile, blood pressure, body mass index, lip circumference, food consumption, appetite, absorption, abdominal distemper, malignancy, inflammation, etc. They also reported that they did not show any changes in other laboratory parameters. Probiotics seemed to reduce ammonia concentrations starting after one mo of treatment."
21584485,"This study focuses on the reliability and validity of three balance measures, the Berg balance scale,the balance subscales of the fugl-meyer test, and the postural assessment scale for stroke patients. The results show good response to all three measures within the initial ninety days but only a very low level of response at 180 days. In contrast, in comparison to other measures used in this study, case-fatality is relatively high among older adults with stroke. Both groups engage in group exercise for 10 weeks. A prospective, single blind, cross-sectional study compares the effects of two community-based exercises on functional balance, mobility, posturity, falls, as well as an outcome measure of confidence in the activities-specific balance Confidence scale. Although there are no significant differences between group measures at week 4, the experimental group shows immediate and retained improvement in walking speed, endurance, force production during the affected leg while sit-to'st and step test. Conclusions That circuit class therapy appears as efficacious as individual pedation sessions for these samples of subjects receiving chronic stroke treatment."
29420053,"In this study, we examine the effects of coconut oil on lipid profiles and blood pressure in healthy Moroccons. The results suggest that coconut is not as effective as the other three regimens because it does not lower high-denity Lipoprotein cholesterol but also reduces total lipophosphorylcholestrol levels. We conclude that palmoleine is superior to coconut in terms of reducing low-DhLcholesterol content. Adaminated fats do not increase HDL or triacylGlycerol; however, they do decrease LDL by 4 p.m. compared with their monounstained fatty acids. Free-living volunteers change from one of the tested oils to another for 10 weeks. This trial was performed through parallel design on 24 patients. No differences were observed in plasmaHDL-cholerrol, highsensitivity C-Reactive Protein, plasminateogen activator 1, insulin, and glucose values. Furthermore, olive oil leads to a reduction in weight and body mass index than the control oil groups."
25040784,"This study focuses on the effects of a three-month workday intervention on sitting time and blood sugar levels in overweight office workers. The results suggest that siting time can be cut by reducing long periods of sitting or by increasing light intensity activity, but not by improving physical activity."
12496220,"In this paper, we examine the early post-birth growth of preterm premature infants compared to those fed breast milk. We find that gains in weight and length gain are similar with both feeding regimens; however, there is a significant difference in number of days needed to regain their birth weight after two months of follow-up studies. The authors conclude that different types of feeding do not influence the health of newborns. For example, one group receives milk obtained from pregnant mothers but does not receive either human milk or an infant formula. This study suggests that maternal milk may be as protective for babies born at less than 30 weeks as it is against infection. A controlled prospective study investigates the effect of express humanmilk on the preventionof infection in low-born infant girls. Both groups have significantly higher weight gain and shorter gestational time."
28496859,"The results of this study suggest that digoxin may be able to shorten the initial atrial response in patients who have had a recent episode of atrium fibrillation. In addition, it has been reported that there are no cases of depointes or sustained tachicardia. A comparison between the two groups of drugs is made. Atrial ERP measures the duration of an autonomic blocking blockade during which time the effects of diversion are more likely than the vagotonic effect of digixin on intracellular Calcium. This study also compares the strategy of ""ventricular rate control"" against maintenance of sinus rythme in those with previous-onset arrhythmian symptoms. It was found that the first-post-AF ERP scores were significantly shorter when compared to either group. However, the primary endpoint occurs in 64 patients assigned to ""rhythm control,"" while in 89 patient's ""rate control."" There was no change in the severity of the disease and no differences in mortality or cardiovascular morbidities. Although some studies have suggested that antiarrhythmically agents can be used for conversion to SinRhythm, none have been published. Antiarthrocy drugs such as ranolazin appear to be associated with reduced risk of heart failure after coronary surgery. Doflelide seems to reduce the frequency of relapse by increasing the probability of getting back to normal sinus pattern. Ranolassinine appears to improve the safety of treatment for patients with severe left ventricular function."
23786819,"A rand-omized study compares weight loss and other metabolic outcomes in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes. In the low-glucomic load diet, subjects lose more weight than they did in the control group; however, this does not lead to any significant changes in body weight or Hba1c. The results of this study are as follows: for the Hgl group, reductions from waist circumference, 37 %) of High-Density Lipoprotein C concentrations, and an increased increase of eight % of Low-Cereal fiber content. This study supports the hypotheses that diets high in glyceric load and low in cereal fibercontent increase risk of developing Type 1 diabetes."
31267483,"The present study consists of forty-eight women, mean. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of instructing young men to undertake 20 minutes of bribing walking in two different ways on fitness and risk factors. In addition, the subjects are also asked to assess their body composition, restingblood pressure, and fasting Lipoproteins. A total of thirty-two women were assigned to either one single bout of resistance exercise or three bouts of short-brisk walking. Both groups showed significant increases in muscular strength and performance of the lower body after the intervention. Twenty-one male adults were re-admitted to a double bout as long as it was not too heavy. This study determines whether ""accumulated short bout"" of exercise can be as effective as an equal amount of time for improving cardiovascular health and weight loss. It is concluded that both exercises improve blood pressure and body mass but do not differ in physical activity."
29481342,"The aim of this study is to examine the differences in patient expectations and concerns between age and gender after shoulder cuff repairs. Prevalences of severe depression were higher in women, in industrial or pain clinics, and in those who reported chronic painful or prior surgery. Age was more highly associated with Reflex Cuff Syndrome than with shoulder hurt without Retextual Constant Scores for both gender; an analysis of variance investigated the influence of Depressive symptoms and Anatomical regions on intake pain intensity and functional status. In addition, preoperative anxiety and insomnia were strongly related to less improvement in postoperative pain scores. At 12 month follow-up, there were declines in the frequency of depression, anxiety, as well as insomnia. Postoperative complaints of psychological disorders are strongly associated With worse clinical outcome."
31461147,"In this study, we examine the effect of exercise training on body composition and weight changes in early post-menopatraal women. We find that exercise leads to a reduction in fat mass among early menopause women who are not on conventional treatment. The main aim of the study is to determine the influence of hormonal replacement therapy on weight change, body structure, and bone Mass in late postmenomepausal females. This study was designed to verify association between sarcopenia and falls risk over 5 years after middle-aged or older men and woman. It found that there were no significant differences in ASM, LBM, percent of bodyfat, or physical performances after 3 years with estrogen therapy. Sarcopenia was present in thirteen % of communitydwelling old women; however, these women had higher risk of stroke, hip fracture, colorecenttal disease, endometric malignancy, death due to others causes than other patients."
28286250,"In this study, we examine the effect of a combination of physical training and exercise on muscle fatigue in elderly patients. The results suggest that COx-2-selelective inhibition may have beneficial effects on muscular fatigue resistance in older patients with acute infectious origin. Forty- three consecutively hospitalised elderly adults were enrolled. They were divided into two groups: one group was trained to train muscular power or another to not strenuous exercise. This trial compares multimodal optimization over conventional periodic management in gastrette procedures. A total of thirty-three patients received an optimized group; 30 patients were assigned to control group. After nine days, the patients had improved their functional status by increasing their energy and protein levels. Their pain scores were lower than those of other patients but no differences were seen between groups. These studies are important because they provide information about risk of bias among reviewers and authors."
27799615,"The results of the telemedicine intervention for type 2 diabetes are described. After six months, blood glucose levels improve significantly in the mentorest group and there is a significant decline in Hba1c level after 12 months. A further study is performed on patients with Type 1 diabetes who have poor control of their blood sugar. This study uses an outcome-based observational approach to determine whether telephone counseling can be effective in improving patient health. In this case, it has been found that phone counseling reduces weight loss by 5 % at 6 months; however, the effect does not reach statistical significance. Telemedicine also appears to improve self-management among patients suffering from Type 2 disease."
29075315,"The purpose of this study is to compare the length of hospital stays, in-patient complications, and rates of routine discharge among patients who have undergone either laparoscopic or open Appendectomy. In the surgery group, a shorter hospital stay was associated with lower rate of infection, while in the antibiotic group an improved outcome was seen. A total of 70 patients were treated with amoxicitis plus clavularanic acid. After comparing the safety of both treatment groups, the results showed that there was no significant difference in risk of relapse between the two groups."
30608987,"The aim of this study is to determine whether the use of piroxic therapy can improve recovery of muscle fatigue in elderly patients who have been treated with acute infection. In this paper, we report on the effect of starvation on muscle endurance in hospitalized older patients with severe acute inflammation. We conclude that it is beneficial for these patients to be given an exercise-based regimen during their stay in the hospital. A prospective cohort study was conducted to investigate the association between patient risk factors and functional decline at admission and at one month's follow-up after discharge. This study showed that all patients were improved by the treatment group except for those with continuing inflammation; however, changes in demmi score and strength were not significantly different from controls. Furthermore, there was a significant change in energy and protein content in both groups. These studies investigated whether resistance training could reduce the severity of disease-related disability in older men with obstrutal disease."
22963896,"A double-blinded, parallel- group design of a six-month study comparing sertraline to imipramin in treating patients with primary depression. In this study, the authors report that both regimens lead to improved scores on the Hamilton Rating Score for depression and improvement on other measures of mental health. The results of this trial are similar to those reported in other studies; however, there is some slight difference in the safety andefficacy of either regimen. For example, although paroxentine and pessetine improve mental function in patients who receive these two treatments, they do not show significant improvements in their symptoms or functional performance. This study concludes that it is important to treat chronic depression as soon as possible rather than waiting for long-term effects."
26210190,"In this study, we examine changes in body weight after liposputation in patients who have undergone abdominogramm. After eighteen months, the group shows a significant increase in bodies weight and body mass-index. A retrospective analysis is performed on 16 patients whom had an epileptic seizure and 17 patients with breast reduction. This study was designed to investigate the effect of fat removal on body composition and metabolic parameters in women who are either exercised or not after surgical intervention. The subjects were divided into two groups: trained for four months and then nontrained for 18 months. Two months later, they were assigned to two different groups; trained as follows: training for three months followed by four month exercise program and untaught for 18."
30046586,"This study demonstrates that a 10-day cycle of ""pelotherapy"" at the spa center, El Rapoo, in Turkey, can significantly reduce the levels of TNF-Alpha and other inflammatory mediators in patients with primary knee osteoarthritis. In this study, we examine the effects of two different types of therapy: 1) mud baths and 2) short wave therapy. The results show that both groups have significant improvements in pain and quality of life after three months of treatment. We conclude that these studies are highly promising because they provide evidence for the use of natural treatments as an alternative to conventional medicine in treating knee Ostearthritis."
30463581,"This study aims to determine whether an electrically-assisted bicycle can induce changes in heart rate and body composition in overweight and untrained adults. Thirty two volunteers were recruited from 22 different sites across the U.S. for this study. The results suggest that exercise is associated with lower risks of cardiovascular disease, including all cause mortality. In addition, there are no significant differences between the intensity of exercise and the frequency of rest."
25862243,"In this study, the effects of six weekly floatation baths on patients with classical and definite arthrosis were investigated. All patients improved for a duration of up to 3 months. The laboratory values evaluated included rythrocyte sequestration rate and Sempro levels of Amyloid A, RheumaToid factor, sodium / potassium, Calcium and Magnesium. After two weeks, all patients were treated twice daily with salts heated at 35 degreesC for twenty minutes. Significant improvement was observed for most of the patient's health indices. For example, pain intensity was reduced by 30 % in the group that received mineral bath packs; there was no significant improvement in self-esteem or pain. This study is an attempt to determine the effect of combined spa therapy on functional capacity in patients suffering from psoratic arthritis. Both groups showed improvements in pain scores but did not improve quality of life."
19588327,"The results of the Stroke and Heart Failure Trial are incongruous because the risk reduced is mild. In patients at high risk of heart failure, routine early angiotension inhibitors do not seem to improve outcome up to three years after CaBG. A Swedish trial in Old Patients With Hypertension focuses on comparisons between active antihypersive therapy with three beta blockers and one triuretic over a four-year period. This study concludes that there is no significant relation between death or stroke for body mass in the placebo control group. However, it does suggest that low body weight may increase the risks of stroke. The European Working Party On High Blood Pressurein the Elderly has been conducting trials in elderly patients who have isolated stolic hypotension. They report that blood pressure decreases significantly from one month of treatment onto the next. There is little difference in disease severity between the treated groups but only slight differences in diastolic blood flow. These studies indicate that this type of hypertension can lead to complications such as congestive myocardialtion and stroke; however, these events are not associated with any changes in patient's health."
27599725,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective cohort study of 1703 patients with conventional heart failure who had been implanted in an ICD between 2001 and 2004, at 128 United States centers. Predicators of mortality included: 'history of atrium fibrillation', /P  1.0001 ; fate to use cholesterol reduction medications - P? 0.0001 -- use of diurtics &#8216use of digitalis or derivatives'), using diuretics for low body massindex i.p.. high resting heartrate...low mean arterial pressure MAP....and poor functional status."" We conclude that multiple trials have shown effective devices to prolong survival in primary and secondary prevention population but that total mortality remains very high. A risk algorithm is developed to estimate risk from stroke or other ischaemiamic attack without any prior attacks. The performance of the risk score is better than those of ChA2Ds2 and Framingham Stroke scores in patients suffering from atrial fibrilation. Atrial Fibrillation is one of most common arrhythmics in acute myomyal infacultation after congestive chest failure. This study describes the association between new-onset disease and stroke occurrence. After adjustment for possible confounding factors, the adjusted relative risk was 1.98 versus 5.00 compared with the absolute risk ratio of 0.9731to 1.0686. Mortality slowly increased with higher Cha2ds2-VASc Scores. These findings relate to the relation between ""atrial fickleness"" and modes of die in 5963 consecutive patients dischargered alive after an abrupt myofa rck yon screened by the TR And Olapril cardiac evaluation registry. There are no significant differences among stroke rates in women as well as in men. Most strokes are embolic. Conclusions That AF increases stroke mortality, cardiovascular death, and all causes of death in the Japan general population."
30985692,"In this study, we describe the efficaciousness of ecotroxib for the treatment of patients with an ""axspa,"" a painful and debilitating disease. We conclude that it is possible to treat these patients without compromising on quality of patient care by using molecular assay to predict changes in blood levels."
29466366,"In this paper, we describe the results of a three-year observational study on two different types of restorative materials. The first is based on siloranse-based filling and the second is composed of methacrylates. After six, 12, 24 and 36 months, follow-up studies are performed using the FÉdération Denville Internationale Criteria. Both systems perform well in posterior teeth after at least one year of service. Although two authors are involved with the production of these reviews, the risk for bias is reduced by not having them involved in the evaluation of the review's methodological quality. Conclusions In class I/Ii restorations, there were no significant differences in failure rates after three years between ormolcer-base and bis GMA-restorative systems. There was no difference in performance after 3 years either. A longer observe period is therefore indicated to getcle clear evidence ofthe long- term performance of These composite resin systems Materical S and Methods Clinical evaluation was done at baseline and afterwards after 1 year using modified United States Physicians' criteria. Two failed classes II moral restoration methods were observed during both groups. One cusp break was the main cause for failure; other fractures were due to proximal discoloration. This study compares the shrinkage of two bulk fill material into Class I Cavities with or without adhesive layer. It shows that the use of dental cement significantly reduces volumetric shrinkages. Proximal contact loss was most likely to be the reason for failing. Composite fracture was also an important cause of failure. Comparisons between group 2 and group 3 showed similar results: marginal discolouration, margin integrity, and surface texture. Finally, another trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of small-particulate hybrid or mocer resterative system as compared to single-polymer composites such as Ad, Admira,Admiram Bond, Volco,Definite etc."
28095788,"The aim of this study is to improve physician compliance with routine preventive care by comparing the use of an inexpensive, easy-to-use reminder system for patients who have frequent visits to their general practitioners. In particular, it has been found that the version of the ""Caius decision support systems"" significantly improves the performance of testing for hypertension and convalescent patients in primary care. This trial was conducted in three Dutch general practices: 39 433 physicians 18 to70 years of age; 48 453 females 18 or 75 years old. Each practice received alerts, ondem and support, or nothing intervention. Adherentity was assessed through chart reviews of a pre-intervention period as well as at one year and two post-intervaled follow-up periods. A total population of 1,260 eligible patients were divided into four groups: practice level intervention, patient-level treatment, and control group. At first, these groups met better results than those receiving both practice levels. However, they did not show any significant improvement in quality of care afterward."
18491999,"A cost-saving is realized even after the intervention costs are deducted. The results of this study indicate that exercise intensity is an important factor in improving LV remodeling, work capacity, and health-regarding quality of life for patients with post-myactal infatriate ion failure. This study compares home-based physical training to conventional exercise on leg muscles as forms of ""home-base exercise training."" In addition, it shows that there is no difference in heart failure symptoms between the two groups. Heart failure is still a very serious disease; only 35 %) survive 5 years after first diagnosis."
29797031,"In this study, we examine the effect of a single arm or forearm tourniquet on total knee pain. The results suggest that the use of these devices does not lead to improvement in patients' leg function. Acute reperfusion is associated with reduced viability in both groups. Post-torture applications are more successful in laypeople than in military personnel. We conclude that there is little evidence for the effectiveness of such devices in relieving post-arthroplasty pain and that they do not increase the success of soldiers who have been trained on simulator training."
26788520,"The effects of a six-week program on sleep quality, mood, and anxiety in overweight women were studied. In addition, the study found that meditation was associated with improved blood pressure, heart rate, weight, self-control, as well as other measures of health. This study concludes that there is emerging evidence for the use of yoga to treat Type 2 diabetes."
25187795,This study consists of three parts: 1) instrumentation for canal preparation; 2) cross sectional area analysis; and 3) final dentin thickening. The first part is an attempt to determine the amount of pulp tissue remaining after canals are prepared using a combination of Niti rotary instruments and 3 different types of tooth-embedding resins.
30633888,"The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of an eicostasic acid-containing diet on weight loss in patients with Type 2 diabetes. In this study, rats are divided into three different groups and given either a highfat diet or alpha lipoicacic acid. After four weeks of feeding, rabbits were split into two groups: the first group was given 'high fat' diet' and the second was treated with 0.25%) -llipoiic acids. This treatment resulted in significantly reduced body weight gain in both groups. There was also significant reduction in blood sugar levels in the control group. However, there was no significant change in other measures of health before and after treatment. These results were not reported in any of these studies."
22071846,"In this paper, the results of a prospective, i.e. solitary appendectomy study are presented. The results suggest that laparoscopic approach is superior to open surgery in terms of short hospital stay, reduced rate of infection, and improved gastrointestinal complications. Although there is some disagreement concerning the relative merits of each procedure, it is clear that both approaches work."
28398987,"In a prospective, cross-sectional study of elderly patients in the Netherlands, we found that frailness is common and at increased risk for death independent of other risk factors. We developed the seven-point Clinical Freilty Score and applied it to other established tools; measure fraility to 2305 older patients who participate in second stage of The Canadian Study of Aging and Longituality. Our results suggest that an intervention to improve frailstiness may be more cost effective than standard care. A disease management program reduces the frequency of heart failure visits by reducing the severity of the illness."
16117815,"The effects of te on the body mass and strength of older men are described. In this study, we examine the effect of transdermal treatment on bone mineral density, muscle mass, and health-related qualities of life in patients with low blood levels of testosterone. We also investigate the safety of dihydromethanosterone as an alternative to conventional therapy for treating elderly men with high blood concentrations."
22884181,"The effects of exercise training with weighted-vests on bone retention and isokinity were evaluated in Postmenopatras r and Omly assigning as exerciser. After 12 weeks, Ostecalcin decreases by 14.5 percent. This study suggests that exercise may be beneficial for older women because it reduces the risk of falling from nursing home. In this study, 229 women who completed the original trial were assigned to an exercise intervention group or control group. Both groups improved in their physical activity but not in health. A further study was performed using a prepost-rand and ommized controlled trial to evaluate adherence with exercises and balance training at levels sufficient prevent osteoporrosis in Indian women aged 40-65 years. Although no significant changes were seen in the controls, the subjects were almost 70 % willing to accept the program."
24681423,"Telephonic case management is associated with improved patient satisfaction and reduced costs. A European Community-funded study comparing the efficacy of a home-based telemetry system to solitary care in patients with congested heart failure was performed. The results were mixed, with some patients receiving better care than others; however, there was no clear trend toward cost savings. In this study, the duration of stay had been cut by 48 %) and the hospital costs increased by 27% after 12 months."
31534973,"In this study, we examine the effect of prebiotics on gut mbiota in obese women. We find that treatment with ITF leads to modest changes over time in the composition of the gut and its metabolites. This is important because it suggests that certain bacterial species may be involved in host-metabolism changes. The results are similar between the two groups. After eight weeks, fasting glucose decreases at week nine but there is no significant change in insulin concentrations or GLP1 in either group. A double blind, placebo controlled trial is performed among 30 obese females treated with 10g/day from inulin for 8 weeks. Fasting blood sugar increases only after 9 weeks; however, there was an increase in Glp-1 in both groups during the 18-week period."
28054937,"The effect of a probiotic regimen on the risk of translocation and gastric colonization in elective surgery patients was studied. In subjects with Type 2DM, diet alone did not result in significant changes in blood lipid levels or body weight. However, there was no significant change in HDL-cholestrol concentrations after treatment. A pilot study was performed to assess the efficacy for an oral proliferating strain of Lactobacterus delBruekii against chronic kidney disease. Results showed that the presence of elevated C-reactant protein was associated with lower total and LD- cholesterol reduction and increased trigllyceride compared to control food. After initial screen the subjects were assigned to receive four groups with fifteen per group. To examine the effects of Probiotic VSL#3, and omega-3 fat acid on insulinsensitivity, blood lipophosphorus, and inflammation, we conducted another clinical trial in sixty overweight adults aged 40-65 years. No significant differences in the biochemical variables, biochemistry, laboratory test results, or HAQ index were observed between the three groups. There were no major adverse events recorded in either group; however, they had no statistically significant difference in their health status over the intervention time. Arthoria activity was examined by clinical examination, haemostasis score, lab tests, ESR, CRP,pro and anti-inflammatory cytokinines."
27819951,"The pharmacist's pamphlet reduces the risk of developing a heart attack in patients with Type 2 who receive only drug counseling. A novel decision aid improves patient adherence to medication but does not improve blood glucose levels. An educational intervention that uses cell phone and the web results in improved blood sugar levels in type 2 patients. In addition, it is found that patients are more satisfied with their care than they were before the intervention. This study compares an eight-week self-care program to one that was provided in ten different countries. It showed significant improvements in Hba1c, fasting bloodglucose, lipid profiles, blood pressure, body massindex, and knowledge. These changes were reported at the end of the trial."
31851083,"This is a prospective, observational study of patients with relapsed Ibd who received either self-management or psychological treatment. The results suggest that the use of psychological intervention may be more effective than physical therapy in treating these patients. In this paper, we report on the efficacy and drawbacks of two different approaches to improving symptoms of ibdemics: 1) using hypnosis to treat pain and 2) using direct current electrodes to induce painful sensations. We conclude that both approaches are highly effective in relieving bowel disease."
19821398,"In this study, we compare the effects of three different antihypersive agents on blood pressure: valsaran 80mg and 12.5mhct; ramipriml 2.5m and 5m, and their combined effect on sitting blood-pressure. The results indicate that combination therapy is more effective in treating essential hypertension when compared against monotherapy. A double blind, parallel- group study comparing two different drugs with one another in patients with ""mild to moderate essential hypotension."" All three are well tolerated except for some side effects. This study determines whether each drug produces a greater reduction in siting blood flow than either agent alone or on placebo. It also suggests that the combination may be superior to monotherapies because it reduces blood demand while maintaining good tolerance."
25877840,"The effect of a high-dose, long-term regimen on multiple sclerical patients was studied in this first-ever prospective study. In the end, it was found that higher doses of vitamin D were more effective than low-dosing regimens with respect to benefiting the disease. This paper also describes an interventional trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy for high dosages orally of 25-hydroxyvinculin D in several different musculoskeletal diseases. It was concluded that these patients were most likely deficient in their supply of this essential substance."
25907778,"In this study, we examine the effects of a lifestyle intervention on weight loss in overweight adults. We find that physical activity is associated with improved health and reduced risk of developing Type 2DM and heart disease. Two randoses are used to examine changes in growth traits of psycho-social constructs; one uses latent growth curtseys representing selfefficacy or behavior strategies; the other uses Latent Growth Curves as an assessment of physical activities at 12 months. The results indicate that web-behautiful treatment works through ""targeted behavior change construct"" to influence physical exercise levels in overly overweight individuals. This paper also discusses the use of self-defineation theory for weight management. It suggests that eating and exercise are important factors in weight control. Self-determination seems to be more highly related to successful weight reduction than diet alone. Although there are few studies looking into the relationship between these two types of behavior, this paper concludes that they may be useful tools for understanding how people gain and lose weight."
16983542,"In this double blinded, well-controlled trial, the efficacious and safety of both haloperidone and lithium Carbonate were examined in children aged 5.1 to 12.2.9 years. The recommended dosages of each drug ranged from 1.05 to 6.0mg/day. For the evaluation of behavior changes and untward effects, various ratingscales were used. Although both drugs were clinically effective, halopridol had more often with unexplainable effects than did lithium carbonate. Children with conduct disorder are at greater risk for criminality than those with attention-deprived hyperactivity disorder. Both medications have short term positive effects on these children. A recent review of motor,perceptual, and behavior characteristics that constitute the MBD Syndrome describes the motor functions as well as the physical features that comprise the condition. There is often history of delayed development milestones aswell as organic cerebral injury due to complications during pregnancy ; traumatic birth or head trauma a) or Intrcerebrally infection after birth ""The concept of minimal brain Dyspancy was developed to accounting for some obscure behavior abnormalities."" Lithium has been shown to be superior to placebo when it is used to treat aggressiveness and aggression. However, there is still much uncertainty about the exact nature of the disease in the United States. It is believed that either active or remitted forms of childhood depression may lead to subsequent mental disorders. Thus, future studies will use general population samples to further inform the Nature and course of such disorder"
17910890,"The safety and effectiveness of a topical cream containing eczingma-specific active ingredients is compared with that of vehicle-based treatment in children. A significant association between the severity of the disease and the family impact was observed. In addition, the child's severity was associated with the most significant predictor of their relative risk for developing opportune childhood dandystiness. This study also examines the efficacy to use cyclosposolin as an adjuvant to treat severe acute idiotics. It shows that patients who receive this form of treatment are more likely to improve their health than those who do not."
24171029,"In this study, all the patients were satisfied with their treatment received and expresses a clear messages to save their naturally dentition anytime possible. The aim of this paper is to describe and compare ""the quality of life"" of patients treated with restored teeth versus those who have single implant- supported fixed prostheseses. All the participants are happy with the treatment; however, no details are available on comparing both treatments based on patient's perception that they will save his teeth. Aim This longitudinal / prospectiove study investigates the frequency of post-ostentation pain experienced after root Canal treatment and evaluates influence of factors in the pain experience. It was found that gender, tooth type, age, swelling, and number of visits were significant predictors of pain during the procedure. Furthermore, it was concluded that dexamelhasone was more effective than placebo in reducing interapplication pain for teeth suffering from vital pulp. Further studies need to be carried out for other endodontitic pulpal conditions as well as for symptomatical teeth because only one implant is lost during follow-up periods. After root canal treatment, each patient receives: ibprofen, acetamineophen plus codeine, 30mg. Each patient records pain dreadfulness, bleeding ability, chewing abilities, etc. Conclusions The impact of rootscare on the qualityof life was apparent."
30954082,"The results of a doubleblind, placebo-control trial suggest that ursodeoxicholic acid, an anti-cholestar drug, may be more effective in treating primary bilary circrhosis than other treatment approaches. In this study, the efficacy and safety of two different drugs, urethrin and alkyl phosphine, have been investigated in patients with acute or late-stage hepatotic disease. Although both treatments show significant improvements in terms of liver function, they do not show any beneficial effects on blood lipid levels."
31053754,Probiotics in the treatment of patients with pcosis improves their quality of life and may even lead to weight loss.
15479938,"This paper focuses on the effect of surgical intervention on weight loss in patients with severe obesity. The results indicate that ""severe obesity"" can be treated and should be considered. Women who die within the first three years of follow up are excluded. In women without preexisting illnesses, intentional weight Loss was associated with an increased reduction in all causes of mortality. However, those who lost any amount of weight were more likely to have a reduced risk of death from obesity- related diseases. A comparison of three different gastric restriction procedures is made. Gastric bypass has been shown to improve health-regarding quality of life in obese subjects. Although it does not improve blood sugar levels, this surgery reduces the severity of obstructive rheumatology by improving glucose tolerance. Both types of surgery provide long-term treatment for both type of disease."
24887617,"The results of a two-year followup of patients with atrium fibrillation are reported. In the PVI ablation scheme, the success rate is 39 % for the first procedure and 75 %) in the second. Paroxymal AF remains present after the initial year; however, this time, it is more successful with an extended period of follow up. A new Circumferential Pulmonary Venous Ablation Catheter is used to treat persistent atrial fillation. It has been reported that metoprololil can increase the proportion of subjects in syphilis during six months' follow-up. This study compares immediate results and quick-response efficacy on amiodone plus propaftenone in patients who had persistent arrhythmies. Both groups have similar rates of improvement in their short-term outcome. However, they do not show significant differences in terms of mortality or embolic events. These studies suggest that there may be some merit in using pulmonatory vein isolation to control attriotic heart disease. Although no major complications were noted, these studies indicate that cryobolition will be superior to drug therapy in relieving permanent atarrhythmical thrombosis."
28024276,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of lifestyle changes on weight loss in overweight patients. He uses a novel approach to determine whether lifestyle change can be used to prevent or delay Type 2 diabetes and other serious disease. The results are mixed: people lose weight more quickly than usual after an exercise intervention; people gain weight less quickly after physical activity; and men lose body fat more rapidly after moderate exercise. However, they do not show any significant differences in blood pressure or cholesterol levels between the two groups. Anderson concludes by comparing the diet with that of someone who has been given hypnosis for over three years. This study is important because it will help identify the most likely cause of heart failure among those at risk."
31940138,"The results of this study suggest that the level of energy restrictions achieved at a weight loss of 0.5 to 1 y after surgery predicts significant long- term weight Loss. This is an important finding because it suggests that patients with severe obesity may be more likely to lose weight than those who have no such condition. A prospective cohort study was conducted in which 100 patients were followed up for 12 months and showed similar percentages of excess weight losses. In addition, both groups showed signs of sweet eating. Heartburn, regurgiation, nausea, constipation are more frequent among these subjects. Methods An attempt was made to compare dietary habits, food preferences, and gi symptoms in subject with extreme obesity following Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass. Both groups had similar amounts of over-excess weight gain. However, there was some trend for sweeteating in the SG group as well as greater consumption of fruits and juice from total energy. The objective was to assess food tolerate and diet quality during the first years after bariatic surgery. There were numerous significant relationships between food tolerance/ diet composition and postoperative body weight change. Food tolerance was reduced after three months but became comparable to the normal population. After gastric bypass surgery, feed reduction was rapid and inefficiency. Thus, specific protocol was devised; however, the risk for undernutrition did not increase until one year. Short-term increases in energy intake were associated with short terms changes in daily energy consumed. For example, fat increased by 78 pg/d1 mo after surgical intervention while protein increased rapidly thereafter to reach 557  4 G/D at 36 mo afterwards. These results indicate that although conventional therapy does not provide immediate weightloss, Bariaric surgery appears to offer favorable results in terms of improved lifestyle, blood pressure, hypercholestererolemia, or other risk factors."
28914636,"In this study, we examine the protective effects of immune mediators from human milk on infant health. We find that increased levels of hematrophic growth factor are associated with an increased incidence of common cold in early childhood. Our aim is to investigate whether early-morning egg exposure will prevent subsequent IgG1-mediated egg allergic disease in infants who have moderate- or severe eczyma. At four months of age, only 36 % of babies had already been exposed to egg-containing foods. The results suggest that higher maternal wheat consumption during the first trimester increases the risk for sensitization by food allergy and asthma. Food allergy is common in mid-age, as was Sensitation to at least one food allergen. High maternal bread intake during pregnancy reduces atopic skin dermatitises; however, there is no association between high maternal diet during late pregnancy and child-to-offspring allergy. A prospective population-based cohort within the Finn Type 1 Diabetes prediction and prevention study has been used to assess the effect of maternal nutriency during pregnancy and lactation on the development of children with CMA. Only about 3% of these patients were treated with soy because they did not have any type of dairy intolerance. Thus, it is possible that mothers may be more likely to avoid dairy when they are pregnant than when their baby is breastfed. Therefore, our goal is now to determine whether delayed introduction of eggs can prevent such an increase in the rate of egg allergy among infant's with heretic risk. This paper concludes that ""we now need to advocate that when an immature child is developmentally prepared, / variety of nutrients should be introduced."""
27100114,"In a crossover design, 14 men perform repetitive eccentric exercises of the elbow muscles followed by one or two control treatments. Results indicate that this treatment does not induce muscle damage but may improve range of motion. A second study investigates changes in indirect marks of muscle injury after endurance exercise and compares the changes with these after maximal eccentric activities. Thirt thirty-six subjects were assigned to ; no previous exercise, placebo, prior exercise +oxidative stress, Prior exercise plus antioxidants.markers of Muscle/cell injury, muscle performance, mushroom soreness, C-Reactive Protein, and creatinine kineaseactivity. Markers are measured before and immediately postexecratved. The recovery time course for contractile properties is unknown. After four bouts at an acutely elevated force, the strength loss is not significant. This study examines whether repeated applications of heat can protect against exercise-generated muscle pain. Twelve male subjects performed damaging exercise upon two separate occasions. Both groups showed significant changes on all measures except for leukocyte count. Prophylactic supplementations with vitamins C had no effect on symptoms of muscular damage. Experiments have been made using single-jointed exercise performed by unstrained individuals. These studies suggest that hyperbaricoxia therapy might improve recovery after exerciseinduced muscle injuries."
21956956,"Forty subjects with a mean age of eighteen years were recruited to an eight-week doubleblind placebo controlled study. The results suggest that over the next six weeks, flavanic-rich chocolate does not improve vascular function among patients with established atheroscomatose disease. In addition, dark chocolate has been reported to reduce blood pressure in healthy subjects and may be useful in patients suffering from essential hypertension. A parallel-controlled trial was conducted in which 100 g white or dark bars were given for 15 days; after this period, no significant changes were seen in blood flow, glucose, and insulin response. This investigation failed as expected. An open-label, parallel group clinical trial examined the effects of high-flavonoid chocolate on lipoprotein oxidation, platelet function, body weight, etc. After two months, these results did not differ significantly between groups. However, there was some evidence that flavonoids may have some health benefits. For example, one study showed that consumption of coconut cream improved blood vessel function but also increased life satisfaction. Another study investigated the effect upon endotriumal dysfunction in postmenopause. Flavanol rich cocoa had similar effects on both vasculolysis and heart function. Both studies concluded that it was possible to use flavinolic-containing chocolate to improve either endometal function or other functions in diabetic patients."
30541103,"In this paper, we describe a novel sleep restriction experiment that involves three nights of restraint in order to determine whether or not sleep can be effectively reduced without consequences. We examine the effects of nighttime sleep loss on behavior and performance in healthy adults. For example, women who sleep deprive themselves of sleep are less likely to engage in risky behavior than men who have no sleep."
28148655,"In this study, we compare the two different methods of resection to determine the effect of each technique on joint line position. The gap technique results in an increase in the value of the post-opportunity when comparing the measured rsection technique with the standard one. Post-operative joint lines are averaged 16mm and the joints line elevation is 24mm after total knee replacement. A patient-specific device called PSI can improve the ability of surgeons to accurately set up the rotational positions of both the tiba and fembra. This new technology has been used for patients with severe bone malalignments who have not received adequate care. Two approaches are described: 1) using a fixed or balanced gap balancering technique; and 2) using pre-operating weightbearing Anteroposoror and Lateral images. Both techniques achieve similar results at 2 years of follow-up."
26161741,"Pregnant women were randomized to receive either probiotics or placebo in a blinded fashion. The results showed no significant changes in blood lipid levels over the 12 months postpartum, and no differences in pregnancy outcomes. In this study, thirty-six patients aged 35-45 years were divided into two groups: one group received proliferating strains from human breastmilk; the other group was assigned to consumption of conventional bread. After eight weeks, the control group had no change in their lifestyle. This study further examined the effect of Lactobacterium delBrueckii on immune response in overweight adults. It was concluded that consumption could be an alternative treatment for Type 2 diabetes. Forty- four patients with type 2, treated by doubleblind trial, were given different diets during the first six weeks of their treatment. Consuming procultured milk did not lead to any improvement in body mass or health. However, there were no major differences between the intervention groups. Probiotic treatment reduced fasting glucose significantly but improved both maternal and child weight."
22161373,"This paper describes a group of parents who received early intervention for children with hyperactivity disorder. They were able to improve their child's behavior by reducing the frequency and severity of their symptoms, but they did not show any significant improvement in parent-rated behavior. The results suggest that early treatment may be more cost effective than other approaches. Parents reported improved social skills and self-control after two years of follow-up. In addition, there was no difference in the degree of improvement between control and mother-child interaction groups. A second study examined whether an eight-month parent training program could reduce the number of children suffering from attention-deficit/hyperactivité disorder at school. It found that this program produced improvements in several domains: parental compliance, parent style of interaction, and social skill development. However, it showed no significant change in both measures of parenting or child behavior over time. Finally, we concluded that ""parent training"" is not sufficient to treat all forms of childhood mental illness."
23840373,"In this single-centre study, 30 patients with severe deficiencies of vitamin D showed a reduction in the severity of disease among the group. A post-hoc analysis was performed in 30 participants who were severely depleted of 25-hydroxyvinmin D at baseline and showed significant reductions in exaggerations in both groups. The main outcome was growth; however, there was no improvement in any of the other endpoints. This paper concludes that daily doses of 100-nmol/L of whole-body or subcutaneously absorbed vitamin C may reduce the risk of acute myosis in Mongolian children. It is concluded that an eight-month regimen of calcium plus placebo or daily dosage of cholecaliferol can reduce infection by reducing the frequency of influenza attacks in schoolchildren."
25765866,"The results of this study suggest that bevelling and etching will not affect the performance of the clearfil se bond in class V lesions. This is a prospective, rand-omized, single-blind study designed to evaluate the efficacy on three-year-old patients with noncarious canine or premolar lessions. In particular, it was found that there was no difference in the extent of superficial staining at the enamel side between the control group and the experimental group. After eight years of continuous use, the self-etched adhesive cleared all defects except for some slight positive effect on margin integrity. At the end of 8 years, only superficial discoloration was noticed. A double blinded trial was conducted to compare the effectiveness of two different dentin systems: Scotch Bond 1 and 2; Tenure and Tripton; and Bayer exp1 and 2, respectively. All subjects received one restoration after six and 18 months. Both marginal adaptation and total discolouration were worse than at baseline."
32194129,"In this paper, the authors present a large population of adults in the U.S. who have not yet been informed about the association between psychediacs and mental health issues. They conclude that there is little evidence for an independent risk of mental illness from using these drugs. However, they do find no significant association with use of psylocybin, mescalin or lyserrgic acid diethethylamine as well as increased likelihood of serious psychological distress after one year. A double blind trial was conducted to investigate safety and efficiacy of LSD-Assented psychotherapy in patients with anxiety related to life-threatening illnesses. The results showed marked reductions on trait anxiety at the first five weeks post treatment. At the two month follow-up, positive trend was found via the state-trait anxiety inventory; p= 0.033 ""with an effect sizeof 1.1 ', and state anxious was significantly reduced."" This study reports on safetyand efficacy outcome for up to six months in anopen-label trials for treatment-resisted depression. Nine of fifteen participants met criteria for complete ""mystical experience"" and were able to maintain their mystical experiences throughout the duration of the trial. There are no major treatment effects. After 6 months, subjects reported improved behavior and quality of life when compared to those treated by conventional medicine."
25972247,"Meloxicam is superior to buprenophine in reducing pain in cats following soft tissue surgery. The primary endpoint of this study is the total clinician scores for pain, inflammation, and mobility. In contrast, dexmetomidine does not improve pain after surgery; however, it does reduce pain at least two hours after recovery. A blinded observational study determines that a transderel bupronorphin patch can be used as an analgesis in dogs with acute pain and stiffness. This study also compares boreanacoxib against ketoprofin in treating cats with painful joints. Both treatments are well tolerated by both groups. Post-operative pain scores are higher than those obtained from placebo. Two other studies examine the effects of morphines on cats suffering from chronic pain. One study uses paw palpation to assess the relationship between joint motion and pain response. Another study evaluates the effect of butorannyl on cat pain during ovariostomectomy. Cats treated with either meloxican or bupranoriphin receive better pain relief than their control group."
30345096,"Pre-Optractive Pulmonary Rehabilitation for Patients With Chronic Obstructive Lung Cancer. This study focuses on the impact of pre-operative pulmonation on exercise capacity in patients with lung disease that undergoes a resection for non-balloon cell lung cancer. It is shown that short-term pulmonary rehabilitation can reduce the rate of post-opportunity complications and improves patient performance. The results support an improved patient care program to prevent plebeiasis after complete surgical rand, as well as improvements in other important endpoints."
32293469,"In this study, we examine the effect of a high fat diet on the transport of pathogens from the gut into the blood stream. We conclude that fat is more efficient than other high-fat diets for transporting microbial LPS to the body. A parallel-group controlled clinical trial was performed in fifty-five females with Type 2 diabetes. No significant differences were observed infasting plasma glucose, quantitative insulinsensitivity check index, hba1c, superoxidation dismutatase and catalase. The intervention group received 10g per day randolf or placebo for eight weeks; respectively, they were divided into two groups. These groups received different doses of resistance starch: n = 28, and control group got 10 g each day for 8 weeks. An aim of this trial is to determine the efficacy of resistant starchik as well as its ability to modulate blood glucose and insulin levels in healthy middle-age and elderly adults. This study has been published in the National Biomedical Journal. It shows that Nutridose ® improves body composition and reduces hunger in overweight patients. However, it does not lead to improvement in all of the measures of health except body weight."
26762372,"In this study, we examine the effect of increased dietary lutein on atherosis in mice. Mice showed elevated blood carotenoide levels and brighter coloration than did controls. We also examined the association between carotenides and Type 2 diabetes. This study was a cross sectional survey of adults aged 25-75 years from 6 different cities and towns across Queensland and Australia. The results suggest that higher concentrations of carogene are associated with lower risks of cardiovascular disease in women. A case-control approach was used to analyze the relationship between alpha-cotene and betacarodene for men without previous history of heart disease. For example, patients who had previously been smoking were more likely to have greater risk of developing coronary atheroism. Furthermore, there was no protective effect against type 2 diseases when compared to those who received only lycopendine or other carcotene. Thus, infants fed phosphorus-rich foods were protected against myomyotic stroke."
28723736,"The authors present a novel approach to the use of cefacin as an antimicrobial agent for surgical wounds. In this study, all patients are given either 20-mg cefoxitine or 30-milligram cefurin in one patient while the ward is on call. Cefazolis has remarkably short half-life and does not cause any complications during the first two days of the operation. Urinaries develop more frequently after the second day of surgery than before. A prospective double-blinded study examining the efficability of prophylic antibiotics for treating surgical site infections among patients with open appendicides was performed among 2139 patients. We identified 26 syphilis outbreaks from which we calculated relative risks for each risk factor. Prophylaxes were administered for only one day; however, they did not increase the risk of spontaneous wound infection. This study will have important implications for current international guideline for infection control strategy in the hospital."
22002191,"A prospective, controlled, randozed clinical trial of 35 patients with acute respiratory infection and other risk factors after abdominal surgery. The results suggest that deep breathing exercises improve lung function in the first post-surgery day than no exercise at all. Thirty two patients who had chronic obricative pulmonary disease were divided into two groups; 17 patients received inspiratory muscles training and incentive Spirometry for two weeks before and three months after their elective upper abdominal surgical procedure. In addition to early mobilisation, these patients also develop a severe restriction of ventilatorry defect and profound blood gas tension during the initial days of the operation. This study is designed to determine whether an incentive system can be used to prevent throbbing complications after chest resection. It was found that incentive spriometrics did not reduce the length of stay or the severity of symptoms in patients receiving either treatment. However, it was observed that some patients developed pleur effusion upon the fourth postoral day."
31921439,"The effects of an eight-week exercise program on body weight, lipids, and blood pressure in overweight and obesity subjects were examined. In the first group, interval training was more effective than moderate intensity continuous training in improving endurance capacity and health; in the second group only strength training increased antioxidant status. Both groups showed significant improvement over time for both reductions in fat mass as well as changes in heart function. All-extremity high intensity interval exercises were better at improving risk factors comparing with moderate-entensity continuously training. This study investigates the effect of high-end intervaltraining on cardiovascular disease risk factor compared with mode-intension continuous train. It is reported that all-exertional interval trains are more efficacious in treating patients with chronic disease. However, it is not clear whether this type of training will be beneficial to people with Type 2D. Therefore, we developed the tool for the assesment of Study Qualities and reporting in Exercise -- a quality assessment tool designed specifically for use by exercise training studies."
30301735,"The study consists of two groups: one group is treated with local infiltration by a posterior approaches and the other with an eccentric exercise program. After six months, the patients were collected from three primary care centers in two municipalities. The mean age of 48 was defined as 11 years old. In this study, pain scores for both groups increase over the study time to 6.6x3 and 7.7x3.1. A second purpose is to determine the effect of topical gluceryltrinitrate on shoulder pain or on functional shoulder movements in patients with spine cord injuries and shoulders tendinopathieses. This study uses double blinded control clinical trials to assess the efficacy of no-treat therapy in treating Achilles tendion disease. There was no significant difference in pain measured using vassal scale between groups. No method had been universally effective in treatment of Achines tendois."
24752440,"Preterm infants are compared to control subjects in height, weight, and bone mineralization. In the first nine months of life, infant-to-be receives significantly higher amounts of calcium andphosphorus than controls. A safety trial is performed to determine whether feeding early in the prematriate period will improve growth and reduce risk of adverse birth outcomes. The results indicate that breastfed infant girls gain more weight at six weeks' post-term than those who receive no intervention."
31731772,"In this study, we examine the effects of fiber on weight loss in overweight women. We find that a high-fibre diet is associated with reduced body weight and increased risk of developing obesity. The results indicate that consumption of whole grain or refined grain products can lead to significant weight gain. This study also uses haplotyped rs00030506, ros9930501, and rus9932754) as predictors for weight change. A comparison of these two groups shows that they have significantly different body mass indexes than those of control groups. For example, men who consume more whole grains are less likely to gain major weight than women who do not. These results suggest that there may be an association between the use of wheat bran and wholegrain food."
29219090,"The results of this study suggest that a 28.6-week school-based activity program can prevent body mass gain in girls, but may induce remissions of obesity in pre-school age children. In contrast, the control group loses all of its weight and gains only 7% of their total body mineral content. This suggests that an exercise intervention may be more effective in preventing overweight than it is in improving motor skills."
29102433,"In this study, we examine the effect of a daily dose of 500 iu.d. on blood levels of vitamin D in patients with severe tuberculouss. The results suggest that daily dosing improves glycemia and reduces death among children with low birth weight. A weekly dose does not decrease the risk of severe malignancies or deaths among young low-birth-weight infants; however, it does lead to improved bone growth. This trial is based on randomized control. All participants were included as part of their original group assigned an intentto treat analysis. Trial Registration Clinical trials. Gov NCT00000415402, Translational studies are used to assess the efficacy of various treatments for different diseases. For example, pregnant women who receive 400 IU of Vitamin D daily have reduced gestational glucose by up to 33%. Maternals and newborn outcomes are examined in two groups. maternal and neonatal outcomes were measured in both groups: gestationsal diabetes, gestational hypertension, preeclosia, and preterm labour. Pregnate women received 800 IV of VD daily but had no significant effects on pregnancy outcome. Type 2 Diabetes mellitateus was studied in this trial. It showed that treatment with 100 ng.h. each day could prevent progression to T2D. No significant differences were found between the intervention group and the placebo group. After four years, there were no changes in the incidence of fracture. However, long term follow-up may have helped confirm this conclusion."
30237020,"In this study, we examine the efficaciousness of ionophoresis for the treatment and safety of interleasional therapy in patients with peyronie's disease. We conclude that it is more effective than current conventional methods for improving penile curvture and size. The results of these studies have shown that transdermal electrodemotive drug Administration yielded similar results as against currently conventional intralesional needle technique and farer in controlling ear-induced pain Penileblood flow improvement was seen in interfero alpha 2b treated patientsbut not in those whom received placebo.

29043156,"Children with an extended version of the De Lacey model show that children with a severe and communication-impaired type of autism are more likely to have isolated or peripheral social relationships than students in their matched sample. This suggests that early childhood education may be useful for preventing social isolation among children who have an acquired disorder. In this paper, we examine the relationship between social anxiety and social motivation in children With an ASD diagnosis. We find that treatment sessions increase children's ability to communicate better in class and improve their prosocial skills."
22161422,"This study focuses on the effects of two-armed, parallel group treatment with assessor blinded trials on children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The primary endpoint is the severity of symptoms and social skills. In addition, the results suggest that this treatment can have a significant effect on improving overall functioning in children who are suffering from an excessively high level of anxiety or depression. A large prospective prospect iv ve study will be useful to prediction the frequency and classifice of the sideeffects in kids treated for attentiondeficits hyperactivity disease. All children were evaluated in an out patient clinic from January89 to March 1995. At 3 years, 485 subjects had similar symptoms at baseline as they did in the Smd group. Both groups received three different intensities of medication each lasting 3weeks with MPH dosage. There was not evidence of differential efficacy nor tolerability. For most patients, combined treatment and medicine management showed superior to intense behavior treatment; however, in several instances, oppositional/attentive symptoms, internalizing problems, teacher-respected social skill, parent- child relations, and reading attainment were more highly improved than those given intense behavioral treatment or community care. However, there was no significant improvement in long term follow-up. Children with both types of ADHD show greater improvements in their schooling and home life after receiving either intervention. They also report reduced externalizing issues at home and increased prosocial behavior among peers. Parents reported better scores on initial symptoms of acute and chronic disorders. Short-term studies examined the impact of supervised brief social learning on adult health. Although only half the children's time was spent with instruction, it was evident that these lessons could improve the lives of young adults with mental illness."
31729817,"The effect of a daily dose of alfalcidol on muscle function is studied in postmensopausals. In the control group, there was significant loss of lean mass. This study aims to evaluate the effects of an active form of Vitamin D on Muscle function in younger women. A total of four hundred and sixty-one subjects completed this study. All were divided into two groups by age: group A received calcium 600mg/d; group B received cholecaliferol 800 i.u. per day; and group C received placebo. At baseline, 25hhD was significantly associated with knee extenser strength, hand and grip strength as well as timed get up and go. When comparing conventional or high-dose vitamin D, we find that it does not improve muscle strength ormobility. Women receiving either calcitario or 1,500 IU ofvitamin D each day had no beneficial nor adverse changes on falls or body mass index. However, when compared with placebo, they found no improvement in grip power or reduce falls. These studies suggest that exercise may be useful for improving bone mineral dentition in older females."

17253498,"After 7 years, 86 of the girls have reached an adult height. The mean difference between predicted adults height before treatment is 12.5 cm; 14.5cm/yr for groups A, B, and C, respectively, being significant different between groupA and groupC. Hormone therapy is well tolerated by all three dosage groups. Short statures and orian failure are common features in Turner's syndrome. All patients receive either hg alone or combination with Ox androlone. In addition, all subjects receive at least six years of growth after treatment. For example, when compared to their expected adult age, the first GH dose increase was significantly higher than that of constant dose groupa. Later, another study investigates the effect of human growthhormone--HGH --on the growth of girls with Type 2Turner Syndrome. This study concludes that it is possible to treat children with this disorder without any risk of adverse effects."
17705840,"In this paper, the authors describe a series of controlled trials that have been performed on patients with acute mania. They conclude that syphilis is more effective in treatment than placebo. Risperidene monotherapy has significantly greater efficacy than other forms of treatment for treating bipolar disorder. The results suggest that it is possible to prevent relapse by using olanzepine or Lithium as an antipsychotic. A double blinded, parallel-trial study compares two different drugs used for the management of manic and mood-threatening episodes. Both are highly efficiacious. Bipolar depression remains largely unrecognized; however, there is some evidence that one can use another's drug in order to treat these patients."
31066022,"This study aims to investigate the effects of a single-leg balance task on postural control in patients with chronic ankle stability. The results indicate that there is no significant difference between center of pressure and injury severity, but anteropostor sway does significantly decrease in injured leg. A double-legged stance test does not change the Postural performance of subjects with low back pain or disability differently than healthy subjects. In this study, we examine the effect of two different types of exercises on knee function after ACL reconstruction. We find that the most liberal definition for recurring symptoms has had little bearing on the outcome. However, when we look at the impact of these exercise regimens on health, it seems that they are more cost effective than surgical techniques. Furthermore, those with acute ankle instability have similar postur-supripostural interactions throughout multiple domains of work memory. These findings suggest that those who have chronic foot injuries may be better able to perform simple tasks while performing difficult ones."
28427968,"The results of this large-scale, Japanese population-based cohort indicate that the use of anticoagulant medication is associated with lower risk of stroke than sustained afibilia. In particular, patients with cha2ds2-vasc score '1 receive more frequent doses of OAC than those with no score. This suggests that improved education and awareness may be needed to prevent stroke in these patients. A prospective registry of all patients who have been hospitalized with acute atrial fibrillation was established in the state of Qatar between 1991 and 2010. All patients were treated with warfarin or aspirin during their follow-up periods. Although there was an increased prevalence of hypertension among Arabs, only 1 % received treatment. There was no change from the previous years in terms of the frequency of incident strokes. However, according to age and gender, prolonged PR interval, RBOB and Intrvenient conduction defects are more common among males and females respectively. Prolonged pr interval had more frequently occurred among men and women than in other ethnic groups. Morphological changes in ECG were commonly seen in health volunteers participating in phases I studies, and vary by ageand gender. These abnormalities were detected in 25.4 per cent of 3,978 healthy volunteers; 2495 male/sexmatched persons aged 18 yr. The mean time for stroke was 11.07 years after which 405 cases were identified. Stroke rates were higher in patients without thrombopoism but not in those without it. Major adverse events were defined as mortality nor myocardials infatriate ract ionor or stroke. From 22842,7878 insured people, we identified 12,612 hospitalised patients within January 1, 2002, March 31, 2004, and December 31, 2010, as the affidal group and re-evaluated the independent predictores of major adverse event. After 89,0468 person- year, the stroke ratio was higher on patients With AF: 1.59 per 100 personyears compared to 2.25 per hundred personhoods in non-AF subjects. Prevalence of atrium fibrillation appeared in Uy Gur elderly people and 4,13 %) among Han elderly individuals. Conclusions That compliance of aspidin and blocker medication among Hawthorne Elders was better than did that in Wuhan Elderly people."
28699771,"The results of this study suggest that the use of a laparoscopic approach to manage acute appendicetis is an effective treatment. In addition, the patients receive shorter recovery times and return to school faster than in the surgical group. This suggests that there may be some merit in using recurrent or delayed appedicitis rather than surgery."
25809923,"A randomized, double- blinded trial is conducted to determine whether laparoscopic intervention will reduce the pain of patients with severe endogenosis. In this study, we find that paracolic adheres are found only in about a third of women with painful pelvic pain. The efficacies of leurolide and danasol are comparable to those of other antidepressant agents. Thirty nine women who have been treated for chronic pelvico pain are followed up for evaluation of their fertility and improvement of pain symptoms. After surgery, goselerelin or Medroxyprogestone Acetate remain superior to placebo in terms of improved sexual function and reduction of discomfort. Both forms of treatment work well but do not result in significant changes in pain scores. There is no difference in blood pressure between the two treatments; however, there is an increased risk of adverse events. This study compares the use of LNG-Ius and GnRhH-A as therapy for treating interstital cystitis: it does not induce hypoestroginism and requires only one patient intervention every 5 years."
31189669,"In this study, we describe the ablation of a patient with acute pulmonary veins using cynical force-guided technology. The results suggest that this technique may be more effective than conventional methods for treating these patients. Acute pvi is achieved in 100 %) in both groups and in 99 percent of group 1; however, complications occur earlier in the first phase after rebuffing when compared to Cb-G2's. This study focuses on the use of cryotherapy as an alternative to conventional approaches for atrial fibrillation."
25268297,"The selective 5-H1A receptor binding study is performed in the vivo. It shows that there is no significant difference in central nervous system function between PD and healthy controls. A recent animal model suggests that disturbances of serotonenoid type-1A function may contributeto chronic anxiety. Although it is not yet clear whether such models are relevant for panic disorder in humans, this does not appear to be clear at all. In contrast, diazenpam significantly impairs control of limb position in first three weeks of treatment. This results in improved performance in both groups. Both group receive CBT combined with busprione; however, they do not show any significant change in symptoms or severity. These results suggest that combination of brain-based therapy and buspirone improves patient's response to behavior changes."
31685858,"In this paper, the effects of a stimulant drug on children with low-IQ and attention-disordered hyperactivity disorder are examined. Children with high-strung mental retardation respond to the drug well but their response is not as good as those with normal intelligence. The efficacy seems to be improved when the child's symptoms are combined with that of an intervention such as medication or behavior treatment. A double blinde trial compares the safety and effectiveness of two different drugs in 16 pre-literate children who have mild-to-meditated ADHD. Both treatments show significant improvements in several subscales of the test. For example, one group shows greater improvement than the other in socializing skills and learning. Other side effects occur with both drugs. All four groups show sizable decreases in symptoms across time; with significant differences between them in degree of change."
28886707,"The Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of women from the United States, finds no association between excessive consumption of sugar or sweetened beverages and risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes. In contrast, drinking more sugar-containing drinks is associated with increased risks of heart attack in women but not in men. A long-term aspartamme capsule treatment has been found to be safe for both men and women. Children are also included in this study because their parents have high predispositions for weight gain. They are divided into three groups: 1) pregnant women; 2) children who are free of diabetes; and 3) adults who do not have any other unwell habits. These subjects are assigned to either drink sucrose or non-nutrition sweeteners. This group loses significantly more weight than the control group during an active weight reduction program. After six months, television watching hours are reduced in the interventioned group while body weight loss is still significant. Consumption was examined in relation to depression diagnoses after 2000 among 78,631 women aged 50-69. Women were then separated into two groups -- one that consumed artificial sweetners and another that did not. Both groups lost greater weight over time. Their diets were adjusted for age, smoking status, body massindex, physical activity, and blood pressure. There was little difference in food composition when adjusting for Age, Smoking Status, Body Mass Index, Physical Activity, Blood Pressure, Athletic Stiffness, Fasting Glycemia/Limitation. Results were calculated by multiple regression analysis using multivariate logitical logistic regressions. No significant changes in body size were observed at week 10, except for waist circumference."
22710280,"This paper focuses on the association between improved patient adherence and post-opportunity, complications, length of stay after major colorecian surgery. It is a systematic review of the available evidence for the efficacy of this regimen in terms of improving patient satisfaction and morbidity. In particular, it was found that patients with fast-track treatment had better pain scores than those with more traditional approaches. Bilateral total knee replacements were performed in this study to compare the results of these two groups. Both groups showed improved quality of life when compared to the control group. A multimodal recovery program may reduce the post surgical stay in high risk patients undergoing colarotomies."
24869750,"In this study, the effects of ticrrynafrane on blood pressure are studied in two patients with mild-to-mode essential hypertension. The results suggest that icrhernane is an effective treatment for moderate to severe essentialhypertension and that it may be more cost effective than other diuretics. A doubleblind, crossover study compares the efficaciousness of captopriml 50mg and hydrochholothiazde 25mct over eight weeks. Both drugs produce significant reductions in siting bp but no significant changes in heart rate or weight. All treatments are well tolerated; however, there are some side effects. Two hundred young men and women were divided into two groups: one group was assigned to receive either chlortalidone 15mhloride or aceButoloL Hydrochlorone 40mG/d per day; the other group received placebo. This trial showed that all three regimens produced significantly greater reduction from sitting  Bp at endpoint. These studies proved that low-dose Diuretic Regiments should be the first treatment of choice among most hypertensesive patients. They demonstrated a major reduction in stroke risk and reduced major cardiovascular disease epidemics. Furthermore, they found that many patients could be treated safely with short-actinating diurestics such as chlorthalidene 12.5mHg or vasartan 160mM/day. However, these trials did not lead to any serious adverse events."
26659821,"In this paper, Seuss demonstrates that the use of low-intensity behavior treatment to treat children with autism improves their symptoms by reducing tantrums, aggression and hyperactivity. The results suggest that early intervention is more effective than regular treatment in improving autistic symptoms. Children with mild to moderate intellectual disability are assigned to either a group of short-term treatments or an intervention group consisting of parent education and behavior management. After one year of treatment, the severity of the disorder declines only for those who have an IQ between 50 and 80. Parents receive training in how to manage their children's behavior while parents receive instruction in child-rearing skills. At week 24, the score on the Autism Checklist-irritsibility subscale decline from 16.00 to 7.38; an independent clinician scores 14 of sixteen subjects as much better or worse at week 24 than the control group."
28235776,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the acceptability and efficacy of a self-help program delivering text messages to people with heart disease. This intervention has been piloted in seventy patients, and results suggest that the program may be effective in reducing the risk of sudden death from acute myosis or stroke."
29340748,"Peptificial wound dressing reduces the rate of sternally wound complications following shoulder arthrocoplasty. A strong association between younger age and reduced rates of revision after shoulder surgery is established. The risk for revision decreases with an increase in age, but this does not mean that older patients are at higher risk of complications. In contrast, the use of Prape reduced the incidence of deep and shallow wound injuries. This study tests the efficaciousness of two different surgical skin preparations on the control of pathogens from the shoulder."
29935874,"In this study, bond strength of several different materials is compared to that of the most commonly used root-end sealers. The results indicate that the MTA Plus group has higher pushout bond strengths than other groups. Aims To evaluate the effects on push out bonds of three different cements: Mta Angelus, MTT CaCl2, and ZnO-Zno Polyurethane. Bond strength was measured with an intron testing machine. This study compares the mechanical properties of two different types of filling material for root canals. First, it is determined whether the use of water will improve the bond quality of various endodontic products. Second, there is no significant difference in the amount of time required to cure each product. Third, the effect of irrigation on the efficacy of different type of fertilizer is examined."
19902985,"Women in the weight maintenance group had normal menstruals during training, but there were some signs of a greater number of abnormalities. The women with Polycysic Ovarious Syndrome were more likely to have Type 2 diabetes melanitus than those without it. In addition, they had higher blood levels of gonadotrophins and reduced body mass. This suggests that exercise may lead to an increase in risk of heart disease. A prospective cohort study was conducted among 82,4039 female nurses from 1982 until 1996. It showed that women who had irregular menses or hyperandrogenism were at increased risks for cardiovascular diseases. These women also reported symptoms of polyceliastic ovariomy syndrome, such as hirsultism, which were not found in other patients."
23160338,"A prospective, observational study evaluating the effect of statin on the risk of atrial fillation in patients with heart failure who are not in af is performed. In this study, we examine the effects of high-sensitivityc-reactiveprotein levels and early post-operative AF following elective cardiac surgical procedures. The results suggest that treatment with 40-mg atorvastain reduces the rate of new-occurrence of arrhythmic fibrillation by reducing the duration of the surgery and shortening the hospital stay. We also report that it is possible to predict future events from blood samples collected after the operation."
17210875,"This study focuses on the effects of weight loss alone or in combination with exercise on blood pressure, body mass, and other risk-factors. The results suggest that diet plus exercise is more effective than statin therapy in reducing high-cholestrolemic disease. In addition, it reduces both body fat and total cholesterol. Both diets have no detrimental effects on health except for bone turnover and Renal function. However, neither diet has any detrimental effect on either physical or mental health."
29450937,"In this paper, the aim of the study is to compare the marginal adaptation between root-end cements based on mineral trioxine aggregate and retrograde filling material such as ProRoot Matrioxide Aggregate. The results are similar to those obtained with IRM in terms of healing rate. However, there is a slight difference in the success rate when compared with Biodentine at the same time. This study also focuses on the use of super EthoxyBenzoic acid as an endodontic root filler."
23839768,"In this study, the effect of dipyramole on thrombolysis in patients with mechanical hearts is studied. The combination of acetychlsalicilic acid and low-dose aspirin was more effective than warfarin at preventing major bleeding in prosthetic heartvalve replacement. A prospective, oblique trial compares the safety and effectiveness of two different regimens of anticoagulant therapy: triflusals or ACEnocoumamarol. Although there were some increases in bleeding during the treatment period, both groups showed significant reductions in the risk of major systemic events. This study also examines whether combined war farin and anti platelet therapy can reduce the incidence of strangulation and post-venture complications after valve replacement for patients who have undergone mitral and anortic heart valves. After six months, all but one patient had a stroke."
26691216,"This paper describes a novel, web-based approach to managing patients' blood pressure. It uses an evidence-based exercise program to assess the effects of physical activity on patients with acute coronary disease. The results suggest that this intervention may be more effective than traditional care in reducing risk factors for patients who have recurrent heart failure. In addition, it reduces the frequency of visits by up to three times per week. A pilot study examines whether telemedicine can improve health behavior in older adults with chronic heart diseases. Although there is no significant difference in patient satisfaction between the control group and the intervention group, both groups show improved health outcomes."
16625624,"In this paper, we examine the effects of a daily high-calcium diet on bone mineral gain in girls with puberty. The results suggest that drinking alcohol is associated with an increased risk of fracture for children. A double blinded placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 160 boys and 80 girls aged 8-3 y past their onset of Menarcheal Bone Mineral Density at age 18years. There was not significant effectmodification of habitual calcium consumption on the relation to calcium supplementation; height, weight, BMC, size- adjusted Bmc, Ba,Bmd / alkaline Phosase, or alkaline phosphatases. Calcium supplementing improves bone mass acquisition in postmenarchial females who have low levels of calcium intake. This study evaluates the long- term effects upon bone acquirement among young women from childhood to adulthood. They are divided into two groups: bed rest, sedentry, exercise, either alone or with other subjects. Both groups show greater gains in total bodybone mineral content than does the placebo group during the early aging period. However, there is no significant difference in anthropometric measurements between the two sets after they finish the trial. After several months, both groups have similar increases in bone material content. Although some evidence suggests that milk may be more effective in treating fractures, little is known about its efficacy in preventive treatment."
29188577,"This randomized, controlled trial was designed to determine whether a high intensity functional exercise program could improve balance, gaitability, and lowerlimb strength in elderly persons dependent on daily living. The results of this trial showed that the exercise group improved significantly in Self-paced gaits speed compared by the control group; mean difference 0.05 m/d, P. 02. At three months, however, the exercises group had improved considerably in self-pace gait speed than the controls group: mean differences 0.5 mm/s vs. 0.02 p = 0.001 In addition, there were no significant changes in the performance of the subjects' mini-mental state examination scores after the training period. A hundred and 9ty- one older persons who were dependent in activities for daily life, living in residence care facilities, or with Count Dr. Manette's miniature-mententality score at three time points were performed using mixed modeling. All longitudinal analysis for continuous variable that were measured during three times points -- week 0, 12, and 36."" Frailtiness has been considered ""a precursor state"" to disability and dependencies on others for everyday activities,"" thus making it necessary for health care professionals to meet regularly with frail older people. Fiftyone older individuals were assigned into two groups: the experimental group led by physicians and thecontrol group lead by nurses. Both groups showed improvement in their ability to walk and stand. They also showed improvements in ankle moment and power. There were not significant effects when the intervention was followed by retraining. Two other studies examined the effect of long-duration exercise training on muscle strength, endurance, body composition, risk of falls, as well as functional outcomes in community dwelling elderly Japanese women. These studies concluded that an exercise regimen described effectively improve Muscle strength"
24798429,"The aim of the current study is to determine whether a pharmacist's intervention will be effective in reducing the risk of heart attack in patients who are already at high risk for coronary disease. At one year, the results of this trial show that there is remarkably improved risk factor profiles in the Choice of Heart Options program compared with those who do not take statins. In addition, they have better blood pressure and physical activity scores than controls. A further study was performed on 100 patients with known chest-heart disease whom physicians had previously treated. After two weeks, these patients were assigned to either group: an intervention group which received calls from an advance practice nurse, or control group; and another group consisting of 200 patients. This study examined the effects of telephone counseling on women after their initial cardiac event. There was no significant difference in quality of life between the groups. However, both groups showed improvements in physical function and health-related satisfaction during the first six weeks after hospitalization. These changes were reported by several different measures. For example, exercise performance was found to be significantly lower when being coached rather than prescribed lipid reduction drug therapy. Furthermore, coaching did not affect knowledge of other risk factors such as total cholesterol but reduced the severity of symptoms. Thus, it was concluded that ""counseling"" could be used to reduce the burden of stress caused by acute myocarital infatriates."
28462286,"The aim of this study is to determine whether daily reporting on weight and symptoms will reduce re hospitalizations and mortality rates in patients with acute heart failure under the national health insurance program. This intervention was a nurse led patient education program, which improved quality of life for patients who had been treated with congestial heart failing. After 18 months, there were eleven deaths or hospitalized events in the intervention- group and 12 in control group. Mdp was still associated With better outcome for all cause death; Hbi was not superior: readmissions, emergency room visits, and cost reduction. In addition, an eight-week educational program increased family members' knowledge about chest failure. A multidisciplinary care program that included home-based medical care and frequent nursing visits reduced the rate of unplanned admissions as well as the costs of care. These results suggest that ""progressive medical treatment"" may be more cost effective than follow-up by primary care when it is applied in two groups."
24253135,"In patients undergoing caBG surgery, enteral nutrition reduces the risk of complications by reducing the length of hospitalization and improving the speed of recovery. Post-anatomy resection is more successful in this group because there are no significant differences in subcutaneous effusions or residual space. Preoperative analgesis improves pain scores significantly in epidural groups. The use of thospice for gastric passage has been reported to be effective in preventing pneumonia in patients with early ecophageal malignancies. A prospective study on pre-operating inspiratory muscles training in acute gysterectomy was conducted. It showed that it was possible to increase blood flow during the post-operative period without increasing morbidity. However, these results were not statistically significant."
29517050,"A prospective, randomized, controlled trial of laa-closure in patients with acute atrial fibrillation is performed. The results suggest that Laa can be used as an effective treatment for these patients. In addition, the study shows that there is a tendency for recurrent or fatal strokes in those who resume antithrombotics after OAC therapy. Warfarin is more effective than other antiplatelet agents in preventing major bleeding and systemic embolism but does not increase the risk of death from this intervention."
22708573,"This paper focuses on the use of case management as a means for improving mental health services for people with serious mental illnesses. The authors describe three methods to accounting for case managers' effects in tests of theefficacy of mental illness services: 1) treating the manager as an fixed factor, 2) treating him as ""a rand and Om factor"", and 3) evaluating service effects withinthe case manager. In this paper, the authors demonstrate that case-management services can lead to improved quality of life and reduced depressive symptoms. These results support the need for more evidenced approaches to treatment of mentally ill patients."
21464190,"This first study demonstrates that early intervention for children with an extended severity of autism can be used to improve their language, behavior, and school performance. In this paper, the effects of early treatment on children who have severe or multiple-spectrum disease are examined. Children receive either a combination of short-term behavioral treatment or an eclectic group of treatment. The results show that both groups achieve significant gains in intelligence, language skills, daily living skill, positive social behaviors, as well as improvement in overall health. A second study investigates the effect of the stronger families project on communication and symbolic skills of 16 children age 2 to 4 years with autistic spectrum disorder. These studies suggest that the Stronger Familys project may be useful for improving social communicative skills in classically audacious children."
31478020,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to improving maternal health care in China by using performance-based funding. They use cluster-randomized and ommized control trials to examine the effect of payment-for-treatment on reductions in inappropriate prescribbing practices for patients with urtis. The results indicate that patient satisfaction is positively affected by quality improvement measures. A clustered two-arm controlled trial was conducted in India to evaluate the efficiacy of an intervention designed to improve pregnancy outcomes. It showed that pregnant women who received high-quality early birth care were better off than those who did not receive such care. This study will inform policy and scale-up efforts to reduce newborn mortality in low- income countries. Preparations are made for implementing the new infection control and care initiative in rural India. However, there are still concerns about the impact of training nurses in assessment, communication, and emotional skills for Ay HIV care; furthermore, some studies have suggested that trained nurses may be more effective at reducing neonatal morbidity than they are at providing these services in other countries where access to higher levels of medical care is difficult."
32196906,"This study focuses on the effects of a resistance training program on fat free mass, muscle cross sectional area, muscular strength, and muscle quality after bariatic surgery. The results suggest that this regimen will lead to improved weight loss and improvement in body weight and risk markers. In addition, it is also observed that patients who undergo post-bariatric surgeries have greater changes in their relationship status than those who are not married or single. Preoperative physical training does not improve these markers further; however, there is no significant difference in weight Loss and most patient behavior was found between the control group postoperatively suggesting that participation with 'Messida-Surgery' may not be sufficient to prevent weight gain. A follow-up study concludes that both groups have similar improvements in all outcome measures except for anxious symptoms. Another study examines the effect of pre-barian surgery education on weight reduction and exercise performance in patients with severe obesity. Both groups lose weight significantly but comprehensive group suffers greater excess weight at 12 months"
24628781,"In this study, we examine the effects of atorvastapin on endotilal function in cigarette smoking patients. Aorva statin does not improve vasculolysis in smokers but does improve their symptoms by measuring the IIef-5 question - a measure of how well they are able to maintain erectors. We conclude that phosphodiesterrase-5 is an effective treatment for most men with ear ache. The efficacy as well as safety of Sildenafil have been studied in two double blinded studies. Men with severe ED were predicted to be at risk for major cardiovascular events. This study was based on population-based followup from 1987 to 1990 and included 1,709 males who had erectilial dysfunction. It did not show any significant change in blood pressure or lipids during the study. However, it showed improvement in sexual function after 12 months."
25601182,"In this study, we examine the effect of a low-to-moderate intensity neighborhood walking program on health-related measures of quality of life in older adults. The results suggest that walking can be an effective treatment for patients with moderate to severe pain. We also report that exercise does not lead to changes in blood pressure or body mass index. However, there is some improvement in physical function among elderly people who are at risk for mild to moderate disability."
22059801,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the performance of an outcome measure, the health status Question naire, in a patient population of patients with severe rheusatoidic arthritis. The results suggest that the measures are sensitive to changes in disease activity and quality of life. This is important because it will help guide future trials of new drugs. However, these studies do not provide sufficient evidence for their use in real-world practice."
29223954,"In this study, a double blinded placebo-controlled parallel-group trial of acetimibe is compared with that of the statin-based AlirocUMab. The results indicate that aliroccumabus significantly reduces low-DiL-C levels in patients at risk of heart disease. Aiming to determine whether reducing LDL-cholesterol levels can be accomplished by statine therapy, we compare the safety and effectiveness of two different regimens: 1) ezetamibe; and 2) bocociumzumabar. Although both treatment groups have significant reductions on Llic-densities, they are not identical in terms of their efficacy. Both studies conclude that there is sufficient evidence for the use of either regimen as an effective strategy for lowering lipoprotein concentrations in hypercholesters."

This paper describes the rationale of and design of an innovative and pragmatic trial involving neighborhood-based walks with low to moderate intensities. The results indicate that walking for well-being is feasible and advantageous for improving quality of life across all age groups. In this study, we examine the effect of short boutwalking on mood state and body mass in overweight and sedentarian women. We conclude by examining the effects of walking on exercise participation levels, fitness, and plasma high-density cholesterol levels among older adults."
19403634,"In this study, we examine the effect of a daily dose of either 500mg of calcium or vitamin D on both bone mineral density and bone turnover in healthy young people. The mean concentration of serum 25hydroxyvitaminD before the trial is 24.1 mol/l in the elderly subject living independently and 73 institutionsized elderly women who live independently over an 11 week winter period. Serum creatinine levels are measured prior to and after the intervention. After two experiments performed one year apart, it was found that there was no significant difference in disease incidence between the Ca-D group and the placebo control group. A further study was conducted for older females aged 62-98 years who were not receiving adequate amounts of food or pills. This study examined the effects of different diets and pills on bone mass as well as body composition in patients aged 10-12 y. Both groups showed increased bone Mineral Density at the middistal range but did not show any significant change in overall Bone Mineral Deposition. These results suggest that long-term consumption of these two types of foods may be beneficial for improving bone health in older women."

25348235,"In this study, the effects of a single daily dose of toltersodine on the efficability of over-active bladder treatment are compared with that of two daily dosages of placebo. The results suggest that both regimens can be used for treating patients with moderate or severe lower Urinary Tract symptoms. A double blinded, multi-centre, rand and ommized, placebo-control trial is performed in 17 healthy male subjects. Tolerable and safety were evaluated by evaluating adverse events, electrocardiography parameters, laboratory values, and treatment withdraws. This was an ivy-blind controlled trial conducted at 71 U.S. centers from November 21, 2000, to October 182001. There were significant improvements in Micturition diary variables and Urodynamic Variations after treatment with either regimen. Adverse Events were generally mild but occurred at low levels. Physicians and Methods The Opera: Overactive Blader : performance of extended release agents trial was arranged in 73 US study centers between November 21 th, 2000; toOctober 18,2001. All volunteers were divided into either extensive or poorly metabolized by Cyp2D6, genotyping. After the trial, all volunteers received either 1 to 2m/d twice daily or 3m once daily. Both groups showed improvement in their urinary tract function. They also showed improved heart rate during the course of the study."
23635412,A recent review of the evidence for the use of naivete in the treatment of mild-to-mid-lifed patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease suggests that there may be some promising approaches to treating this disease. The Swedish Elderly Caregiver Questionnaire was used to assess the extent and predictors of patient satisfaction with taking medicine.
26094664,"In this paper, we examine the effect that weight loss after gastric bariatry is associated with improvements in health-regarding quality of life. After a year's follow-up, changes in body mass index are noted. The mean change in waist size was 35.7 p.m. at 1 year; however, there were no significant differences between groups. A prospective observational study was conducted to determine whether patients with severe or morbid obesity who had undergone laparoscopic fixed gastific b and eating prior to surgery could be compared to those without such an intervention. It was found that both groups improved their health related qualityof life by improving physical function, mood, and emotional well-being. Both groups lost significantly more weight than expected during the follow up period."
27498397,"In this study, we examine the effect of simvastain and losartan combined on lipid levels. Simvastatin reduces blood triglarity in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Aiming to determine whether statins can be more effective in treating hypercholestrolemic disease, We investigate the effects of combination therapy on insulin resistance, adsorption, and lipoprotein expression. The results suggest that simpvasatiin may be superior to monotherapies in improving endotility and reducing inflammatory markers."
29713620,"In this study, we investigate the effect of Pycnicol, an anti-cancer drug, on patients with a history of recurrent chest pain. After eight weeks of treatment, blood pressure and other risk factors were significantly reduced in both groups. This was the first evidence to support use of polyphenolic extracts from pine bark as ananthesis for treating heart disease. The results suggest that Pycotnogenole may be effective in relieving oxidative stresses caused by acute myeloid lethargy."
27779429,"This study focuses on the relationship between age and muscle activity in healthy adults. It shows that walking and running are more similar in terms of their speed and duration, but there is some evidence that older people have less mitochondrial capacity than younger subjects."
25405560,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates that the use of gastric bypass surgery to treat patients with Type 2 diabetes can lead to significant weight loss and improvement in quality of life. He concludes by stating that both treatments improve general health measures but provide greater improvements in the effects of weight on overall well-being. This study is a follow-up of an earlier trial designed to determine whether Rouxen-Y Gastric Bypass could be an effective treatment for obese patients who have type 2 or severe hypertension. The results of the previous two studies suggest that it may be possible to use surgical intervention as an alternative therapy for these patients."
29266851,"In this study, we examine the association between overweight and under-weight perception and risk factors for psychological distress among Greek teenagers. We find that body size perception increases the relative risk of obstructive weightiness among both male and females in a cross sectional study. The results suggest that individuals with higher body mass index are at greater risk for purging later in life than those with lower self-esteem or low levels of physical activity. This paper uses an observational longitudinal study to assess the relationship between perceived weight status and depression in Chinese girls. A significant association was observed between depressive symptoms and actual measured weight; however, no further research is needed."
30219968,"This study aims to prospectively compare the results of robot-adssisted knee arthrostry with conventional manual surgery. The main drawback is the high complications in early stage, particularly in the early stages of the procedure. Aim Robotic-Assigned Steer Implantation technique has better results in terms of pain control and improvement in hip function. In addition, there are no significant differences between the two group's scores on the Short Form health Survey outcome question naire. Furthermore, the United States study uses 136 total hip replacements performed at three different centers. These studies have been used to assess changes in patient quality of life during various procedures. Although these studies do not directly compare to one another, they show that the mechanical alignment improves the outcome of this type of intervention."
32242268,"The aim of this prospective study was to determine whether the balancing methods for rotating platform affect post-operative knee  Kinematics. Sixteen consecutive patients consented and were treated with different surgeons during their kneeling activities. This study determined that there were no significant differences in knee pre-opportunity between groups, as well as an overall prevalence of unwanted contact joints during weight bearing activity. Level of Evidence III In addition, the overall frequency of undesirable contact is low; however, it does not differ between surgeon's groups. Furthermore, only the distal part of the posterior cam/posterior engagement occurs. A further study examines the concepts of surgeon ""preference"" in thigh kneering and compares it to the concept of anterior cruciates. It found that both types of prostheses performed better than the natural knee, but that they did not meet expectations of pain or mobility."
26272286,"The purpose of the present study is to assess the value of slow gait Speed, a validated risk-avern score, as an independent prediction of major morbidness and mortality after cardiac surgery in elderly patients. In this paper, we describe the use of ""frilty"" as one of three predictors for adverse outcomes following heart surgery. We conclude that frailties are associated with increased risk for complications during the initial period of pre-elective surgery; furthermore, they may lead to longer post-operative stays and greater length of stay. A prospective cohort study was designed to determine whether frailstiness predicts long-term hospital admissions and death. It was found that those who had moderate or severe forms of fickleness were more at risk of serious events than those with less severe types. This study also uses the National Veterans Affairs Surgical Risk Score to compare the validity of risk scores with their actual patient population. Although there were no crude associations between these two groups, it was concluded that higher fralicties were associated significantly with longer days of hospital stay and shorter duration of follow-up. Furthermore, older women with high levels of vitamin B status were much more likely to have severe complications after electing to undergo colorectric surgery"
22460295,"In this study, we report results of an r and Omized control trial aim aimed at joint attention and symbolic play in pre- school children with autism. Results indicate greater expressive language gains for both treatment group compared with that of the control group. Speech before five years of age, IQ, gender, and diagnoses of medical disorder and epilepsy were variables that corroborated outcome on the Disco algorithm forautistic Spectrum Disorders. The classical and ""atypical"" groups were fairly poorly affected by symptoms in the Social interaction category; other common childhood Autism symptoms, including malaccomplished and stereotyped behavior, were morevariable in follow-up studies. This study concludes that early detection and intervention are essential for improving long-term outcomes of individuals with or without autism. Children with mild to moderate intellectual disability show significant gains in imitation skills after receiving a novel form of imitation training called reciprocal imitation training."
28619779,"CHIP Germany's 40-hour lifestyle intervention program reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by reducing blood pressure and body mass in patients at high risk. The results suggest that this approach may be more cost effective than other approaches. In addition, it improves patient satisfaction with the treatment. At the final measure after 12 months, the BMI is reduced by 1 versus 0.3 kg/m2-in controls. This suggests that a ""holistic lifestyle"" intervention might be an effective strategy for preventing Type 2 Diabetes. Both groups have significant reductions in their cardiovascular risk over the course of one year. Acute hypertension is particularly important because there are still many patients who do not have sufficient control over their blood levels. However, these patients are likely to experience even greater changes in health when they receive such an intense regimen."
24246907,"The kyphoscope and flexible ruler can be used to assess the severity of thosis in patients with upper body disease. A comparison of the DeBrunner's kyphometer, a device for measuring lumbar sensitivity, and roengenographs shows no significant differences in the reliability or repeatability of these two devices. However, there is no relationship between age or skin size and the keratin angle measured by the Debrunner instrument. This study furthermore establishes that the debrunner-kypometer is more reliable than the other two instruments because of its small size."

We assess the effect of saw palm-too herbal blend on urinary scores, sexual function, blood chemists studies, prostatic score, quality oflife, serum prostatespecific antigen, prostate volume, histological studies; and pooling of results across different studies confirms the validity of Pooling the results"
27149163,"This study consists of three parts: 1) a double blind, placebo-control trial to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic bread in patients with Type 2 diabetes; 2) r and Omized doubleblind, parallel-armed trial for the treatment of acute prostitutes; and 3) an obliquely manipulated control trial. The subjects were assigned either to consume one or two different types of bread for eight weeks. After six weeks, no significant changes were seen in their blood lipid profile. In this study, thirty-six young healthy volunteers aged 35-45 years were divided into two groups. Thirty men and 18 women were randomly assigned to either consumption one of the four different kinds of food that contained Lactobacilus acidophilous, Lactopus casei Dn001 10 cf UFC/ML BifIdum and 2, g oliofructoses. A total test period was 30 days. Ten individuals who consumed daily doses of 100 ml of 105 UFF/mL L. Carbonellus Acidophilus, 107 UFODOBUM and 2 G Oligofroutose, while 10 others drank only the same amount that did not have any srymbiotic bacteria. Methods An utmost group of twenty volunteers received ten times the amount of each shake as opposed to the other 10, and they were all age ranged from 50 to 80 years old. They were treated with both metformin monothérapie and combined therapy with met formin and sisfonyllurea. Although there were no differences in fasting blood concentrations between groups, the mean values of glucose levels were lower in the interventional group than those obtained by the control group. Furthermore, abdominal fat areas were significantly reduced in comparison to controls."
25059850,"In this study, we examine the effect of patient-specified instrumentation on the accuracy of total knee amputation. We compare the performance of two different types of instrumentations: surgical instruments with conventional guides and patient specific cutting guides. The results show that the newer technology can improve the consistency of the preoperative plan for patients with both type of injury."
23893306,"The effects of six weeks of a prescription omega-3 acid ester on low-disease lipoprotein concentrations and size were found in 29 men and women who had isolated hypercholestemia. In addition, the results showed that gemfirzil reduced large LDL and HDL particle sizes significantly. A case-control trial was performed to determine whether gemfibrozilizl's effect on NMR measurements could be used to predict new heart disease events. Niaciin reduced both small and largeLDL but did not lead to any significant changes in total cholesterol levels."
29765338,"Family-based treatment of anorexic patients leads to faster weight gain in treatment, significantly reducing the cost per patient. This is especially important because eating disorder symptoms and comorbital psychiatis are more common amongst young adults than they are among older adults. The results of this study indicate that family-oriented therapy can be used as an effective treatment for adult patients who have severe or adversity-like anoexia narrates. In addition, it improves self-report habits by improving food behavior during weight recovery. A novel psychological treatment called ""Mantra"" has been developed for outpatient treatment with mixed results. At first, there is little improvement in physical well-being but gradually improvements are noted. After three years, however, no significant change occurs in other aspects of the patient's health. There is also some evidence that using group-therapies such as Cognitive Remedition Therapy may be more effective than individual-treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy."
21491405,"Back and neck pain is a major problem in the United States. There are many different forms of treatment for patients with back or neck injuries, but no one has tried to specifically treat these conditions. Some studies have suggested that work-related activities can be more effective than physical activity alone. A study has been designed to examine the effects of an exercise regimen on workers who suffer from neck and shoulders pain. The results suggest that this regimen may be useful for returning to work. In addition, there are other studies suggesting that it is important to keep workers active during their workdays."
25436902,"In this study, we examine the effects of early feeding on infants who have a high risk of developing necrotizing Enterocolitis. We conclude that early feeds do not seem to increase the rate of Necrotizing intolerance or morbidity in preterm babies. However, early introduction of milk improves growth by term age and is associated with improved bone mineral content. Early entry of enteral food in prematurely bred newborns has no significant effect on disease but does lead to better growth. After 24 months of follow-up, the results are reported. Babies received early or delayed feeding were more likely to develop Nec. A pilot study was conducted to determine whether early enterals can be used as an effective treatment for neonatal infection. The results suggest that there is little difference in the severity of the disease between groups. Infants were divided into three groups: early; late; and control group. All children were assigned one of three feeding regimens: continuous nadastric feeding, intermittent navastic feeding -- or intermittent Orogastry feeding. Each group had different characteristics regarding their feeding habits. For example, cases fed early did not show any signs of NEC. Later studies suggested that using expressed human milk may help prevent infections from occurring."
25365699,"In this study, we examine the effects of physical activity on chronic fatigue patients in a laboratory setting. We conclude that exercise is an effective treatment for patients with severe and persistent fatigue. The results of this trial are as follows: pain-catastrophing is related to bodyly pain, depression, activity limitations/partiplication restrictions, employment status, and exercise ability. A reduction in fatigue scores after therapy is observed. Furthermore, different models were calculated and compared. This study furthermore investigates the acceptability of adding cognitive behavior therapy to the care of patients who have been suffering from ""cold fatigue syndrome."" It was found that only two eligible patients had consented to participate in the study. However, studies using self-reporting measures showed improved health-related qualities of life andpsychosocial functioning in subjects with CFS. Although the Self-Rated Scores were widely used, no study yet investigated its psychological properties in patients With chronic Fatiguing Syndrome. After completing pacing exercises, patients reported better quality of daily life than before. They also noted improvements in heart rate and muscle strength. These findings suggest that there may be some role for physical symptoms in managing the disease."
25261329,"This is a first-in-man, single-blinde study to evaluate the efficacy of inhaled prednistone in patients with moderately severe smoking-related heart failure. In this study, we examine whether spum ecsinophia can predict pain and improve treatment for patients who have mild or moderate airflow limitation. The results suggest that there may be some benefit in using morphine as an anti-hypertensive drug."
29396832,"The safety and tolerability of statin therapy for patients with a moderately elevated LDL concentration are reported. Ezetesibe is well tolerated, with no side effects. In two-week studies, the dose of 10mg was sufficient to reduce the risk of heart attack in mice. A further study showed that ezetimbe can be used as an effective anti-cholestrol therapy in patients who do not achieve their recommended lipid goals. This trial also demonstrated that it can safely be combined with other fat-modifying agents such as simvastain."

Conclusions The number of possible surgical site infections can be reduced through rapid screening and exclusion of nasal carriers. In this study, 917 patients were enrolled in an intention to treat analysis. Of these, 808 had undergone a shoulder surgery. After two months, the overall negative culture rate was 6 %; the positive colonization rate for throucome-negative staphylococci was 30 0% vs 7 7%.

32174622,"The survival rate of different material crowns is compared in this paper. For example, the survival time of a single-rooted tooth is calculated after examining 1,065 patients with primary morals. A highly significant difference is found among the success rates of various material restorations; for example: preformed crownS, amalgam, composite resin S, and glass Ionomer C. In addition, there are no differences in the lifetime or replacement rate when comparing cements used as dowels on cast teeth."
32268422,"The results of weight loss in patients with morbid obesity are compared to that of control subjects. After six months, the changes in blood levels and body mass are noted. In addition, there is a significant improvement in the anthropometric and biochemistry characteristics of the study group. Six months post surgery, fat loss leads to improvements in several measures of cardiovascular disease and risk. Thirteen patients were studied at age 49.2 years; BMI was 48.1 x 5.3 K/m2; leptine concentrations were negative with fasting insulin levels but not with bodily mass or insulin actions. At 6 month, improved C-Impregnary scores were similar to those of healthy volunteers. A diponectin responds to acute exercise as well as other blood parameters. Both groups receive glyguride for treatment. This treatment does not lead to any change in overall health. However, it does improve the performance of men with Type 2 diabetes."
21735306,"In this paper, we describe a method for comparing the Neck Disability Question Observation Score with the Bourne Mouth Question-Neck Measure in neck pain patients. This new instrument has high internal consistency and good testretest reliability. The Neck Pain Question is used to determine whether treatment can be effective in patients with back pain. A comparison between the two questions is made. Both measure are sensitive to changes in the severity of their condition. However, they do not differ in terms of change on either scale."
30940994,"In this study, we examine the changes in surface roughness of denture materials after three-week wear. The results are compared to that of patients with no stomatis. We conclude that although there is some improvement in the appearance of the new material, it does not require remaking."
24641632,"In this paper, we describe the effect of a brief psychological intervention on treatment satisfaction for men with obstructive erectility. After three months of psychoeducational treatment, patients report higher satisfaction with their treatment onset, treatment duration, and sexualconfidence than they did with silldenafil only therapy. This suggests that adding an educational intervention can improve overall satisfaction in treating ED. The results are similar to those obtained from other studies. For example, after six months' time-limited group psychotherapy, women reported improved satisfaction at earwax initiation, longer treatment periods, increased communication about resemblance between partners, more confidence in treatment plans, greater improvement in quality of life among couples, as well as improvements in sexual satisfaction. A further study is performed to investigate the efficacy of combined medical and psychological approaches for treating men who have dyphilis. It was found that these approaches resulted in significantly improved patient satisfaction, family life, intimacy, mood, etc. Furthermore, there were significant interactions between change in mood and changes in physical health. These findings suggest that ""treatment options for managing disease"" may include medical or psychological treatments."
28065886,"The aim of this study is to compare the infliction of thrombosis on patients treated with cryoenergy and balloon ablation, a new technique for the catheterized treatment of atrial fibrillation. A total of 2406 patients were included in these studies. After one year, there was no significant difference in the rate of recovery between the two methods. In particular, the incidence had been significantly higher with the use of balloons than with other energy sources. This study reports results from the German registry regarding efficacy or safety in pulchria ablacation with different energies after 1 year follow up. Conclusions The STOP-AF trial demonstrated safeness and effectiveness in paroxismal atrium fibillation; for whomat least one antiarctic drug has failed, with risk within accepted stit and  Ards for ablate therapy. At 12 months, effectiveness of the Cryo Balloone abulation procedure versus drugs was determined at 6 months. Confused by the fact that it would be difficult to achieve single delivery pulmonary vein isolated using the balloon alone, physicians decided to perform the procedure as soon as possible."
17204567,"The effects of weight reduction and exercise on knee pain in older adults are examined. In the dietary weight-losing group, pain reduction is greater than that of the control group; however, results are limited to measures of physically health or psychological outcome that relate to the physical body. This study examines the effect of a combined diet and activity intervention on the health related quality of life of overweight and obesity older patients with knee Ostearthritis. Although the final pain scores in both groups are less than those obtained after treatment, there is no significant difference in their functional status. A further study investigates whether adherence to an exercise regimen improves physical function among elderly men and women who are overweight or obese. It is found that higher exercise fidelity is associated with better improvements in six-minute walk distance after 6 months and in improvement in self-repressed disability after 18 months. Furthermore, this study concludes that long-term exercises and consuming weight loss reduce chronic inflammation in old adults with osteoarthritis."
28251248,"In this study, we examine the effects of a daily regimen of exercise on fatigue and mental health in patients with breast cancer. Esomeprasole reduces nighttime chestburn and gerd-related sleep problems as well as improves sleep quality and performance in older adults reporting moderate to mild sleep complaints. We conclude that exercise is more effective than other treatments for improving sleep in people with brain tumors. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, random-experimental study was performed on 70 patients who had recurrent insomnia after surgery. The results suggest that physicians can be more successful in treating these patients when they continue their treatment."
23483932,"Nitritol-based treatment is particularly beneficial for older patients with a Type 1 or Type 2 hypertension. The results of this study suggest that nifidipine may be more effective in preventing strokes and other cardiovascular events than diuretics, beta blockers, or other drugs. In addition, it reduces relative risk of stroke by 26 percent when compared to placebo. A further study on the efficacy of nictinoprime as an agent for reducing blood pressure in elderly patients suggests that this form of treatment may have some drawbacks."
25882585,"In this study, the effect of self-etched cement on bond strength is compared to that of conventional methods. The results suggest that C-et has better bonding strength than either of the other two approaches.

23128863,"Several studies have investigated the effects of weight loss on patients with knee pain. The most significant effect is seen in patients who are overweight or obese. In addition, there is no significant difference in pain scores between groups after treatment. Acupunture and resistance exercise are more effective than physical exercises for improving knee function. Ostearthritis suffers from a variety of musculoskeletal disorders. There has been little evidence of an improvement in quality of life among older adults without knee injury."
20824372,"In this paper, we describe the use of the Post-Surgical Observation Score for the EnUMmeration of Morbidity and Mortality to predict mortality in patients with colorectal cancer. The results suggest that the P-POSsUM model is accurate as an instrument for predicting mortality from surgery. However, it overestimates post-operative deaths twofold in comparison to the Cr-postsum model. This paper also discusses the importance of using a score like the Pompe-Possum or the AcPGBI score to calculate risk-abandoned mortality. It shows that both scores are accurate when used together."

InTRODUCtion This paper compared the influences of various irrigantants with andwithout ultrasound or laser light irradation on the Bond strength of glassposts cetered with selfetched cement in supplementary dentine pretreatment. Failure mode analyzes were also performed. Results showed that there was remarkably little difference between bidium/yang laser application and either chlorhexine or Naocl, but no significant difference was found for the use of either solution. Post sectioning was performed below the cementonamel junction."
26581769,"This paper reviews three published papers on the efficacy and long-term performance of restorative materials for primary teeth. The first study focuses on using resin modified glass Ionomers to replace amalgam in Class I, II, and III tooth surfaces. In this fourth study, the authors select the most appropriate material for each patient. Resinmodified glass cement has a longer survival rate than amalgam, but it is not as strong as amalgam. Aims To investigate risks for secondary caries occurring adjacent to direct restorations in children. Forty eight children receive treatment with vitrremer tri-cure glass ionicomer system. After two years, 96.7 per cent of the class I Gic and 91 Percent ofthe resin-based Composite restoration are successfully repaired. However, there is no significant difference in success rate between these two groups."
17329725,"Heart failure patients receive daily reports of their weight and symptoms, which reduces the risk of relapse and mortality. A telemedicine system is used to track blood glucose levels in patients who have advanced heart failure. The results are compared with that of nurse telephone support or usual care. In this study, we examine the effect of home-telemonitory technology on patient health outcomes. We find that the use of the phone improves readmissions for patients with severe heart failing but not for those with less severe conditions. This study compares two groups of patients: one group uses a device called the ""modem"" to collect blood pressure and other information from the patient's own pocket; the other group only uses an old-fashioned paper diary. It is found that there is no significant difference in the quality of life between the control group and the intervention group. For example, when physicians and patients use an interactive web-based asthma management tool, better asthma controls are achieved all the patients examined upon entry into the trial and after six months of treatment."
17943887,"In this chapter, Wuthering Heights focuses on the use of pentosanse to treat interstitial and recurrent forms of cystitis. He uses the UW-Cystitis scale to assess the efficacies of two different drugs in treating patients with these painful and sometimes life-threatening conditions. The first is a morphine-based topical cream that can be used as an over-the-counter anti-inflamatory treatment for both men and women. Although it has been reported that there are some drawbacks in the current form of medicine for treating such complicated and often misdiagnosed diseases, Wollstonecraft's work suggests that it may be more effective than other approaches."
30470205,"A randomized, open-label trial of a self-reliant exercise program for older patients in the acute hospital setting. The results suggest that this program may have some beneficial effect on post-opportunity and recovery, but no significant effects were shown when measured by function. In an observational cohort of elderly patients, the proportion of times spent in three different levels of mobility was examined. Thirtey-two old people hospitalized at geriatic hospitals were assigned to either the treatment group or the control groups. Both groups showed improved health and performance. However, there was no difference in age between the two groups; only one group had greater gains in strength than the other. This study also investigated whether resistance training could be used to prevent deterioration of muscle function during chronic disease. It was found that backward walking was more effective than forward walking in terms of improving leg strength."
29689282,"Acute temporal limbectomy is associated with improved symptoms in patients after 6 months. In contrast, the overall prevalence of psychological disease before and after surgery is similar to that of patients who had previously undergone an anterior lobectomy. The severity of mental disturbances was lower at six months post-surgery but individual changes were noted in many patients. Aggression is a common form of social interaction yet little is know about its neural correlates. This paper uses fMRI to investigate the role of premeditated aggressive behavior in early childhood. Adolescents with depressed brains show greater increases in their ability to control impulses than those with healthy controls."
29406017,"A r-and-omized doubleblind, crossover design was used to examine the effects of an aerobic activity training intervention on memory and brain function in patients with Multiple Sclerosis. The results showed that there was no significant improvement in fatigue amongst the groups treated with 200mg modafil or placebo; however, there were improvements in performance on the modified fatigue severity scale. In this study, we examined the effect provided by an exercise training regimen on learning and motor function and hippocramal viscoel using magnetic resonance electrodes. This study is the first attempt to use mixed amphetol salts, extended release, to treat multiple sclerical disease. It shows that memantine improves attention, motor speed, and other measures of mental health in subjects with multiple dissipated musculoskeletal diseases."

They also report that there is no difference in symptoms between the two treatment groups. A large-scale doubleblind trial determines whether or not vitamin C will prevent the common winter cold. It is found that both groups experience fewer chills and fevers than those receiving placebo; however, they are not associated with greater severity of illness."
20621942,"In this study, we examine the influence of a type of skin-incision on the rate of scarlet recurence after fasciectomy for patients with Dupuytenren's disease. We find no statistical difference between these two groups of patients having an incision closed directly or by Y-V plasties. After two years, follow-up is required because of the high repeatability of each group. Thirteen patients have palmar Dupusytren contracture and are divided into two different groups. The arm, Shoulder, and H score in the Pnf group are significantly lower than that of other patients who undergo the same treatment.

The primary outcome is to assess whether statins can be used as an anti-heart failure predictor."
19420096,"In this study, we examine the effect of single-dose iodination on blood spot concentrations and thyroid function in Swiss children. The results indicate that a change in thyroprolin levels may be beneficial for improving both the quality of blood spots and the ability to produce thyroid secretions. A double blind, placebo-control trial is conducted in which all children receive ten milliliters of tyrogloboulin per day. At the conclusion of the trial, all changes in Urinary Iodinate concentration are within the normal limits. After 10 mo, no significant changes were seen in Thyrotrologin volume or Tg; however, after 3 - four mo after supplementing, resorption of salt became evident. Children with iron deficient anemia have reduced their sensitivity to these drugs. However, they do not show any benefit from either treatment. We conclude by conducting 304 schoolkids aged 7'13 y old into five equal group that received iviol as / 10 %solution of potassium icode as follows: 8.7m every 2 hk, group A ). 29.7 M. every month, groups B. 148.2, n1 = 92.2 Mb. Every 3 mo was group C."" The mean Urine IOdine concentration measured at baseline had declined only in the first group but gradually increased in each group. This suggests that there might be some benefit in using multiplexes such as foodlets to increase ureasity among infants. Both groups are moderately unable to respond well to daily or weekly doses due to their low urination. They also fail to improve their performance on tests of intelligence and motor function. Brain development is important for maintaining healthy nerves because it is necessary for proper brain development."
22515411,"The effect of zinc and mineral A on blood sugar, lipid profile, and nephpathy in type 2diabetic patients is studied. In this study, the effects of combined zinc-and-vitamin A supplementation were compared with those of placebo in patients with Type 1 diabetes. This was the first study to assess the efficacy of either combination of these nutrients in improving glycmox control over time. Although there was no significant improvement in overall health after treatment, some studies suggest that zinc may be an effective antiinflammatory and antioxidant aid in people with diseased musculosities."
24957911,"In this paper, we describe the initial ten years of results for a new type of knee replacement. Although the survival rate is excellent, there are still signs of progressing Osteoartritis in other parts of the body. The patients receive better results after two years with improved function and laxity than before. This study compares the use of tension guided or spacer guided knee implants to those using fixed bearings. Both devices result in greater pain relief but do not lead to significant changes in patient function."
19581635,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to catheter ablation with an open-irritated irrigation catheter. They compare the success rate of three different methods: 1) using an electrode map that maps the septum or anterior lair wall during atrial fibrilation; 2) using circular mapping and electroanatomically mapping; and 3) using cooled tip needles for circumfferential vein isolation. The results are similar in all three groups. A total number of 180 patients are randomized from the three treatment strategies. Isolations of pulmonary vessel antra were achieved in every patient. Anticoagulation was not used before nor after atrium fibrillation Ablation is performed in 1100 consecutive patients who had drug-refatory AF. This study uses two versions of ""three-dimensional electrical mapping system"" to predict the outcome of both ablate procedures. After completing their studies, no significant differences were found between the two approaches. For example, when isolated by PV isolation, it resulted in greater cure rates than those isolated alone. However, there were complications associated with either left superior or right superior PVs as well as other arrhythmic lesions. These findings indicate that complete linear block on roofline joining inferior pulmonary veins may eliminate both archeryias. There are no reported reports of complete line of block at the rooflines in patients with Paroxysal attic fibrillesation. Although these techniques have been used since the beginning of the twentieth century, they do not appear to be safe or effective."
28678974,"In this study, the results of a laboratory-controlled trial are presented. The results suggest that crowns made with CFRC material do not perform very well as conventional metal posts. Post-retained teeth fabricated using glass fiber reinforced carbon post or cores show higher fracture resistance than those treated with conventionally prefabricated posts and cementation. A comparison between these two systems is made. Tooth Type, Type of final restoration, and presence of adjoining teeth are found to be important predictors for failure rates in tooth restored with either post-and-core system over an observation period of at least four years. After six, 12 and 24 months, patients are recalled and they are divided into four groups: Aestry Plus; group 2; DT; and Foc Postec. They are followed up for 5 '56 months. All teeth were restored by one type of post except for 29 teeth with ferrcule. This study compares the survival rate among three different types of posts after five years of follow-up. Results showed that all subjects had good long-term success. However, there was no significant difference in survival when compared to control groups."
25802737,"A prospective cohort study involving six groups of people with chronic low- back pain was conducted. All patients showed a decrease in spinal stiffness after treatment, but no difference between groups were observed. The objective of this study was to investigate whether spinal rigidness changes aftertreatment; i.e. the relationship betweenpre-treatment spinal strenness andchange in stiffnes with treatment;: v / whether spine stiffnity predicts outcome or response to treating in chronic lower back painful patients. No difference among groups was observed."" Centrelization could help identify sub-groups withinthe population with high back hurt, and could be useful goalsetting and case managementtoll in the Rehabilitation of Low Back Pain Methods This study included eighteen subjects who were categorized as either centralizers or not centralizes. Eighteened subjects were classified as treatment successes, 15 as failures, 21 as slightly improved. Prognotic factors were tested by variance and regression analyzes for their ability To predict treatment outcome. Results In total 82 patients were treated with delayed surgery or conservative treatment. At 1 year, most patients had improved disability and leg pain scores. Although more than half have persisting symptoms, they all showed improved quality of life. Predictive factors such as time off work, nationality, physical load, etc. were less predictive of success in terms of long-lasting pain. Transdermal bupronorphino was found to be safe and efficacious in relieving lowback pain when compared with placebo. However, it did not lead to improvement in function."
24314354,"In this study, we examine the effect of alerting and decision support on patients with a history of type 2 diabetes. The intervention has been shown to improve blood pressure, weight, and cholesterol levels in primary care practices. A nurse led telemedicine program is more effective at reducing risk for heart disease than usual care by promoting self-management on top of normal care. This trial was designed to determine whether an integrated patient specific electronic clinical reminder device could be used to increase rates of recommended treatment for Type 2 diabetics. It was found that the use of the system improved the odds of prescribed treatment but did not improve the quality of care delivered by physicians. Physicians who were not trained in physician-based learning were less likely to prescribe metformin when their patients had renal impairment. Two physician learning approaches were further developed: 1) using the Heartweb health information technology tools; and 2) using e-mailed prompts to help patients manage their condition. These studies showed no significant differences in the outcome between the two groups. However, there were some improvements in both group's scores of cardiovascular risk factors after one year. Furthermore, these results demonstrate "
30013206,"The aim of this study is to determine the anti-inflammatory and fibrinerolytic effects of reveratrol in patients with Type 2 diabetes melanitus. In this paper, we report that a single daily serving of soy milk can significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 disease by reducing the levels of both pro- and procancer stewards. We conclude that these results are due to the efficacy of the two different forms of treatment. Aiming to investigate the effect of one-year-long consumption on blood marrow concentrations of Pro-Inflammatory Compounds, our group was divided into two groups: 1) 200 g/day of Soymilk; 2) 200 Ml/d each of conventionally prepared dairy products for 8 weeks. This trial was designed to examine the changes in plasma markers of inflammation among diabetic patients who were treated with either placebo or randolous intervention. Our group showed no significant differences in terms of weight, BMI, waistcircference, and other measures of severity. Furthermore, there were no serious adverse effects. Therefore, it was decided that an eight-week ration of Reverate would be sufficient to prevent Type 2, Diabetes Mellitus from developing."
31368773,"In this study, we examine the association between maternal 25-hydroxyvindal D concentration and risk of adolescence-like symptoms. We find that higher levels of 25H dihydrate are strongly associated with lower risks of prosocial difficulties in children. However, there is no further study to address this issue. A recent pilot study found that treatment of childhood ADHD was safe and efficacious. This paper reports on the effect of daily doses of vitamin D on symptoms of patients with attention-deficit disorder."
27650684,"The JGOG3016 trial showed a dosedense regimen with carbopicillin as the main treatment for patients with advanced, epithetal ovarian disease. This regimen significantly improved overall survival and was associated with higher quality of life than the conventional regimen. In addition, it was more cost effective to give primary chemotherapy before debulking or surgery. A comparison between the two regimens was made. For patients who had stage III or IV disease, both treatments seemed to be equally effective."
31711532,"In this paper, we describe the results of a study in which infants were divided into two groups: one group was given Lactobacilus reuterius DSM 178938 and the other was an identically appeared and tasting placebo. The results showed that babies who received the probiotic treatment had significantly reduced their daily crying time than those who did not receive it. This is important because many studies have found no evidence for the use of these particular drugs in treating infantic colic. We also discuss the latest edition of the American Society of Medical Aetiologies's Guideline on reporting efficacy or safety of medical treatments."
27806951,"In this study, the effects of balance training on patients with ankle instability are compared. After six weeks of balanced training, individuals with Cai demonstrate improved dynamic balance, inversion joints position sense and changes in motoneuron excitability than healthy controls who do not train. A cohort study is performed to determine whether an ankle-sprain injury can be prevented by propriotic exercises. Nine healthy subjects were assigned to two groups: one group received Gistm treatment; the other was sham therapy. The results showed that no significant differences were found between the control group and the cai group. Postural control and function improvements were seen in the active group but there was no difference in pain or disability. Plantar Massage was shown to have the most meaningful effect on improving ankle stability in those with acute ankle injuries."
28238400,"In this study, the color of two different types of aqueous fillings is compared after four weeks in four different drinks. The results show no significant differences between the colors at first and after 3 years. A single-handed operator places all restoratives according to manufacturer's instructions. After three years, all restorations show only minor changes; however, they do not meet the Acceptance Criteria for Class I or class II restoral material. All patients receive two extended classes of restoration that are similar as possible. This resulted in an annual failure rate of 1.69 % for bulkfilled restoration with D-Emp and 1.03% for the resin Composite-only restoration system. Conclusive: Although the one-step adhesive showed good long- term performance, it was the main cause for failure. For example, during the initial 8 years of service, Ceram received 92.6 percent of the patient population. However, after five years there was no difference in the quality of surfaces, margins, contact point, or other characteristics of these materials. These results suggest that their use may lead to further defects due to fracture or marginal gaps."
22824531,"In this study, we examine the changes in knowledge and problem-solving ability among patients with Type 1 diabetes who are managed by a group. The results indicate that they have improved their knowledge of disease and quality of lives. A cultured approach to self-management has been proposed for Spanish-speaking people with type 2 Diabetes. This intervention is based on 10 group sessions designed to improve patient's knowledge, attitudes, and selfefficacy. There is no significant change in depressed symptoms between the two groups. Further studies will be performed using larger groups than ten months. These studies should be repeated over varying periods of time frame. For example, one group receives the ""diabethic"" lifestyle program and the other receive usual nursing care."
29872464,"In this study, the effects of masked replacement of refined grain with wholegrain in children were examined. The relative risk of Type 2 diabetes was reduced by 0.58 for refined grains and by 1.07 for whole-graine consumption. A cohort of seven5521 women who had no previous diagnose of type 2 disease were followed for 10 years. This pattern, which was higher in sugar- sweetened soft beverages, refined flours, dietsoft drinks, and processed meal but low in Wine, coffee, crucifferous vegetables,and yellow vegetables showed an increased risk to type 2, although there were no significant differences between weight and blood glucose concentrations. Consumptions of sucrosesweetened hard drinks were associated with an increase risk; the relative risks were: 1.29 - 1.63 compared with that who rarely consumed them per month. Women who consumed more than 1 serving of soft drink per day were at greater risk because their body mass index was greater than or equivalent to 29. They also had a greater tendency to gain weight when they consumed less than 3 servings of sugary soft drinks each day. These results suggest that excessive fat intake is not sufficient to prevent Type 2-disease. However, it is suggested that these changes may lead to reductions in body weight as well as improvements in overall health."
29034800,"In this study, we examine the efficacy of hip exercises and knee exercises in patients with Patellofomoral pain syndrome. We compared two different types of exercises: 1) quadricep-stending exercises on pain and function; and 2) conventional knee exercise regimens for women who have patellofiefemoral painful syndrome to determine if they can be used as part of a treatment plan. Both groups showed significant improvements in pain, function, and isostoknity at the end after six weeks of rehabilitation. This was not found to be true in other studies. A comparison between the Posterolateral Muscle Strength group and the Quadrateps Stening group was made. The results were similar but no difference was found in the improvement in Pain, Function, or Isokinetic Muscul strength. Furthermore, both groups had better long term outcomes than those in either group."
15762255,"In this paper, we describe the results of a series of hip replacements performed by one surgeon from 1974 to 1987. The Charanley prostheses have improved significantly over the previous two designs; however, they are still more expensive than the Stanmore prothesis because of their higher failure rate. We also report that the new cementing methods have reduced the failure rates considerably. A prospective study is conducted in which patients receive cementless primary arthroplastys with Zirconia-Coated Stems at an average survival rate of 59% after 9 years. This compares favorably with the conventional method of using cemented stems and cup but does not result in aseptic looseness. After nine years, no revisions are needed for both types of prosthetics. Two hundred consecutive primary unceremoniously randoped total hip archprostitutions were prospectively acted upon using collareded and collarlessness versions of an exact titanium stem. No significant difference was noted in mechanical failure or Ostelysis. Neckless hips lose much more medial bone cortically than collarless ones. There is no difference between the outcome of initial repair and subsequent revision. For example, when the final definition of failure is exp and deemed ""patient dissatisfied,"" the survivor rate decreases to 86.3 percent  5.80 % for either type of prostthesis. If the patient's end point definition includes patient discomfort, the survival ratio falls to 4.9 per cent. However, there is some improvement in the quality of the cement used during the procedure."
24292820,"The results of this study indicate that a daily supply of 250 nmol-g of vitamin D1 can effectively raise 25-hydroxycalciferorol levels in patients with severe osteoponorotic disease. In addition, the level of parathyroid Hormone and bone mineral density decline significantly after three months. This suggests that current recommended sources ofvitamin D may not be sufficient to maintain adequate concentrations of 25Hc. A long-term prospective observational study is performed to determine the relationship between steady state blood concentration of cholecalcifyrol and the result of serum 25OHD concentration. It was found that men with depleted 25hhc levels were more likely to fall than those with adequate levels. Conclusions: Deficient 25 Hc values are prevalent in cardinal surgical patients in central Europe and are independent associated with risk of Maccaemia. Nurses in the highest dose of 500 iu had lower rates of falls than their placebo group."
21821300,"The EortC protocol compared once-daily fractionation of 70 Gy with 35 -40 fractionations in 7'8 weeks to pure hyperfertion of 80.5 Gy in 70 fractionions in seven weeks using 2 fragments of 1.75 Gy per day. In T2-T3, oropharynous carcinoma, no significant differences were found between the two groups. Overall survival was not significantly different; distant metastases, contralatéral breast and loco-recurence rate were notsignificant. Tumor O2 as determined by this method represent a novel tumour feature which can been individually determined for every tumor and which are independent from other know oncological conditions. A 5-year follow-up showed no improvement in the control rate after post mastectomy. Postmastectomy did not improve overall survival but improved in patients with positive nodes. This study describes acute response of either oral or pharynaggeal mucousa to imrradiation schedules using differing doses perfraction. It was noticed that incidence of Grade 3 Dyphagia is lower and recovery speed from it was faster in those with greater ostinificatory antigens. Conclusive The length of patient mucosus receiving dose close to the prescribed dose correlates With grade 3 dysgiata. Purpose This report describes the acute respond of both oral and phryngeals audibly received at dose closer than the prescription dose corresponds with grade-3 dysphagis. Prompted by an update of the 5 year results of ""the r and/omized study of postoperative radiotherapy"" shows no survival benefit over adjuvant therapy in either Duke category. An updated five-year result of treatment of 11 patients including primary radiation demonstrates no advantage in any of these three categories. Furthermore, there was no change in severity of disease during the period of follow up. Preparations for further investigation into the use of oxygen absorption following whole breast surgery have been made. Actovengin has been well tolerated although some side effects may be noted. After several trials, Actomegine has shown efficacy in treating arm lymphodema following conventionally irrational treatments."
31676655,"The minimal clinically important difference between three outcome measures of back pain was found to be 10. 12 and 8- 9 unit, respectively, which not significantly exceed the tolerance interval. In this paper, we examine changes in the short form health survey from a cohort of patients who had been receiving treatment for lowback pain for ten months. Although improvement is noted after treatment, the mean follow-up time for these patients remains unreliable. A further study is undertaken to determine whether there are any significant differences between the Hamilton Rating scale for depression and the Clinical Global Impositions Score on the same scale. This study concludes that an antidepressant can be safely used as long as it is shown to have no significant negative effect on both patient and physician."
18617867,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-assisted study of postmenopause symptoms in 164 women aged between 49 and 63 years found no association between physical activity and mental health. The main outcome was myocaric infatriation and death. In contrast, lower rates of heart disease among women in this group persist throughout the follow-up period. This study concludes that exercise appears to improve mood and behavior in middle-aged females but does not appear to have any effect on mental well-being."

17679673,"In this paper, the association between spontaneous echocardiogram contrast and stroke is examined in patients with acute atrial fibrilation. The risk of stroke increases rapidly with age. Age, relative risk -1.8 per decade, P.001 ; female sextortion, 2.6%/year, 22 %); hypertension, 2.9 %; smoking habits, 1.15 g.m.. blood pressure, 3.16 mm. A risk stratification system for primary prevention separates patients into those who have high risk factors or moderate risk factor analysis, and those whom have low riskfactors. Strokery occurs more rapidly than with other risk elements. Warfari has been shown to be effective in preventing recurrent strokes in both men and women. However, warfarin is not as effective as aspirin when it is used to prevent thromboemia in people with atrium fibrillation because there is a higher proportion of these patients treated with aspidin. This suggests that although some patients are at greater risk for stroke, they may be better off taking war farin rather than aspriin since their symptoms are so similar."
21501439,"Pregnancy outcomes are compared in this study. The risk of anemia is higher in the daily or weekly regimens, and possibly higher with the three-week regimen. In contrast, the combination of iron, folicacin, zinc,and multiplemicronutrients provides no additional benefit to improving maternal hemoglobin status during pregnancy. Fe deficientiency is known as one of the major causes of Anemia during pregnant women, although other minor nutrients may also play a part. Hemogen concentrations vary by time of gestation, but there is no significant change in ferritin at any time. Iron stores decrease throughout pregnancy regardless of dose. Women receive iron from birth until midwifeship. A double blind trial compares the effects of prenatal iron supplementation for improved haematology and pregnancy outcome. It was concluded that iron prophylactics can be delivered through traditional birth attendant's services."

28224415,"A two-year early intervention pilot program for back injured nurses is presented in this paper. It consists of prompt assessment, treatment and recovery through modified work. After the first year, patients return to work more quickly than controls. The results are that there is an increase in the rate of return time from the intervention group over the next three years. In addition, it has been found that workers with depression tend to be more likely to recover after the initial period of sick leave. This study also includes a comparison of the cost effectiveness of different forms of therapy for treating back pain. One type of intervention is ""grade d activity,"" which involves training workers in how to use their hands to help them move. Other forms include ""standard care"" and ""workplace-based workhardening."" These studies have not yet been published."
21396097,"The Consolative statement was intended to improve reporting of trials. Qualitative signal was detected by comparing the wording in the original reviews with descriptions of results in new systematic reviews that addressed the exact same topic, pivotal studies, clinical practice guides, or major textbooks; for example, UpTo date. In this paper, the authors describe three different approaches for treating caries: 1) an amalgam-based restorative approach; 2) an atraumatic Restoration Approach; and 3) obliquely fabricated restorations using glass ionicomer. After two years, there are no significant differences between the survival rates of both approaches. A recent study compares the longevity of single-surface fillings with those of amalgam replacements. Caries progresses most frequently on surfaces adjacent to either type of restoration. This study investigates whether fluoride cement can prevent secondary rootcaries when used frequently. It is reported that anticoagulation is recommended during acute myo Cardioval Ion treatment. All patients should receive anticipation as part of the hospitalization procedure. However, all patients who have not received any specific contraindication should be treated with Anticoagulant before being admitted to the patient's room. The current investigation is performed to determine whether glass-ionemer cement repairs could contribute to lesions indental lesion. Although it is clear that these methods do not work, they provide better survival percentages than the conventional technique."

The results of the study showed that both groups had higher mean intelligence scores than those in the placebo control group. Children who received iron did not show any improvement in their growth or appetite. Further research is needed into the relationship between these two groups. A double blinded trial was conducted on 219 rural Mexico children aged 18 -- 36 mo; they were assigned to receive 20, mg Fe/D, 20m Zn/ D plus 20g Fe'd Or placebo. No significant differences were observed between the treatment groups but no changes were seen in other anthropometric characteristics. Journal of Cunegonde: Iron supplementation and Anthromycin treatment for iron status, aniemia, growth, Morbidity, and development among children Aged 6 - 12 months are divided into three groups by gender. They received half the amount of iron given during the rain season when malaria transmitted was maximal. This intervention was approved as an international St and Ard R and Omised controlled trial. After 2407 children contributed  2554 child-year follow-up after 1,752 child years. Scores from an iron desolate not aneic group gave iron increased significantly while score for aniron deficient notanemic group got no change. However, this may reflect some irreversibly physical or an adverse environment milieu which could lead to stress. Both groups reduced morbidities but had no effects on growth"
30023433,"This study focuses on the knowledge transfer and behavior outcomes of 11- 12 year old boys who watched the ""More Safety, More Fun"" educational video. The players were divided into two groups: those who had bodychecking experiences at age 13 and those with no experience at all. In the first group, players lost more time during practice and games than they did in the second group. Concussion is a major cause of injury for young men wearing face shields; however, there are other risk factors that may lead to greater injury from helmet use. A pilot study of high school boys playing ice hockey showed that helmets can reduce concusessions by reducing the frequency of head injuries. However, this study was limited because it involved only one arm. It included five well-conquered case control studies. Five of these cases met our selection requirements. Bicyclists were studied in three-year cohorts as part of an effort to reduce the incidence of brain injuries in highschool boys' tournaments. These studies found that most of the teams forfeitd their majority of cones, head hits, and other injuries but that many of them wore full faceshiels or mouthguards during play. There were also significant differences in neck injuries, concursions, or other minor injuries between conditions. After controlling for Prior Knowledge level, Age and Competitive Level, F1=0.41 and P1 =0.523. To evaluate whether knowledge transfers were improved among minor league players, questions were asked about concoussession knowledge and players' attitudes and behaviors."

To investigate what characterizing the athletes with disorderedaseal eating, and to determine whether a proposal method of screenings for ED's in elite athletics does not lie about sport-specific behavior as indicators of disease. All women representing the national team at the junior nor senior level, aged 13 or 39 years, were invited into participate. More than half of the Norwegian elite athletes had clinical eating disorders than those in other sports. Therefore, statisticallybased risk factors do not universally validate, but specific related to animals and non-attractive subjects respectively. Purpose To explore the prevalence of ""the female athlete triad"" in Norwegian Elite Athletes and control subjects. In part I, all male elite students received treatment with an overdose of diabolox did not have any significant effect on leanness or hip bone mineral density. Parameters were calculated for age, gender, body mass index, sexual harassment/abuse, dietary history, training history; and Eating Disorder Questionnaire.

26628678,"In this study, we compare the efficacy and safety of a combination of antihypersive agents in patients with systelic hypertension. We conclude that although various drug treatments can lower central blood pressure, different drugs may have different effects upon central BP, pulse pressure or augmentation index. The effect of each agent is not yet clear; however, it seems to be possible that some of the four classes of drugs might have more beneficial effects on central-blood pressure than others. For example, atentolol has no significant effect on arterial stiffness. Aortical wave reflection contributes to determining heart rate and brachiality. Although both agents are equally effective for reducing central/brachial bp, they do not seem to have any significant difference in central Bp. This study determines whether changes in leftventricular mass under drug treatment are associated with changes from central or brazial SBP as well as with an increase in caroteid wave reflectance. It was found that there were differences in these changes between men and women. Both groups showed reductions in chest artery wall thickening but neither group showed any change in vasodial bricatory force. These results suggest that either type of therapy should be used in cases where central control is needed."
20238349,"The purpose of the study is to implement and evaluate tailor-made practice and personalcare plans to improve patient care and objective results for patients with heart disease in general practice over two years. This will be based on evidence from medical charts, consults with practitioners, and patient surveys. In addition, it will investigate the effects of an exercise program that involves lifestyle changes and risk factors as well as improved health status. After follow-up, there are no significant differences between intervention and controls. Acute myocardiac infatriation was similar to previous acute or revascularised events, while health condition was poorer. Preparations for further studies suggest that such a program could improve postMI survival among males. However, this program has no overall survival effect. Within their first one year secondary prevention visits improved patients' health and reduction of hospital admissions; they also showed improvements in physical activity, diet, blood pressure, body massindex, smoking habits, etc. They were not significantly different at baseline in quality of Life. There were significant improvement in the group who participated inthe program were seenafter 1 year inquality of life: 78 vs 9 p..1 ; P = 0.001 per year.

Long-term aspirine treatment with either 200mg or 500mG led to recurrent myomycardial infusion ion that occurred in only one group. This study compares effects of amlopidine with placebo in older patients with essentialhypertension who have been controlled with Amlofin or Enalapral. Blood pressure increased significantly during the first two weeks but did not change at any time. These studies suggest that there is an indirect effect of antiinflammatory drug use on hypertension. Although there are some differences in effect upon renal function among these drugs, they do not seem to be significant. They also indicate that both drugs may induce changes in blood vessel function. Astrin does not affect blood vessels. However, it does increase the amount of constagling prostagl which leads to vasoconduction."

The results of the study indicate that alphalipoic acids have a beneficial effect on the inflammatory responses in subjects with idiopathic fibromyopathy. After three weeks of treatment, there is an improvement in the endometrial dysfunction of these subjects. This is due to the anti-inflammatory properties of alp-lipomeic acid. Aiming to determine whether alphospholipofacic acid can be used as ananthemic modulator in Type 2 diabetes, we studied the effects of 1,200mg daily for 12 weeks. There was no significant change in blood sugar or anthropometric measures after the intervention. However, it reduced fasting blood pressure, food intake, and blood tension in patients with chronic sedentary disease. These patients had lower levels of inflammation, malondehydes, iron stores, etc. They did not change during the course of their studies."
31531322,"In this study, we examine the effects of low-dose meperidine on the occurrence and severity of spontaneous shiverring in patients awaiting elective caescarean section. We conclude that adding dexmetomidine or midazzoam to bribivacaine increases the time for spinal anesthesia but does not increase the motor block recover time. ANOVA, post-hoc test with boneferroni adjustment, and ch-square test were used to analyze the results. The mean intensity of sedations was lower in the group receiving sufentanyil than those receiving morphine. This study is designed to compare the effect of using intrathecal cenidine as an adjuvant to local analgesis during Cesarioan delivery. It shows no significant differences among the two groups regarding the Demographic and Operative Data. There were No significant difference in nausea and vomit between the three different groups. Shiverling was observed in eleven, 10 -- 2 patients in each group. Experimental treatments are added to hyper baric bumbivaaine as follows: Patients in control. These patients were assigned isotically dubbed to three groups from 30 patients each. Intrathcal deXmedetomolidine was superior at increasing the level Of Sedation which is necessary to prevent anxiety without any detrimental effects. After spinal block, 100 milliliters tramadyl was applied in one group, followed by 0.5 g/kg Dexmedentominium in another group; after spinal blocks, 200 mg trampler was administered in both groups except for ""time to ask opium"" which was longer within the control group P 0.001"". Sensory and Motor Block characteristics, duration of Postoperative Analgea, maternal sideeffects,and neonatal outcomes were compared."
22381255,"The results of this study suggest that weight loss among overweight or obese individuals seems to be a risk factor for premature death. In contrast, those who become physically active are not associated with excessive mortality. A prospective cohort study has been conducted in which 6,119 male and 22,21 female runners aged 35-59 years engage in vigorous physical activity and diet to reduce their body weight, waist circumferential, blood sugar, and lipogeny. After 18 months, the women in the exercise group lose 17 pounds and 10cm wk1. This suggests that there may be an association between physical activities and weight gain in older women."
30948833,"In patients at high risk of heart attack after amputation, early treatment with angiotension-converting enzyme blocker does not improve outcome up to three years after the procedure. However, it is more likely that this form of therapy will lead to adverse events later in the patient's life. A double-blinded, placebo-control study of 2453 patients re and ommly assigned to Quinapril, target dose40mg/d or placebo, who were follow up for ages. The results showed no significant improvement in major cardiovascular event free survival. After 3 years, the quinpil group had only 13.7 compared with 12.2 %) among the placebo group; however, there was increased severity of adverse effects during the first three months after surgery. This was due to the earlier use of niedipine as an anti-angiothrosin agent. Although blood pressure reduction was observed, these results did not support the claim that ""reducing atheroscy"" is responsible for beneficial effects of anacetic agents on major coronaries."
22932280,"The effect of iron depleted drinking water on anaemia was studied in the community. Forty two iron-depleted women received 100 millig/l of ferrous salt or placebo per day for six wk, and subjects trained for 30 minutes/day, 5 days after daily exercise. Iron stores were increased in all three groups receiving iron, but no significant changes were seen in blood concentrations. Women who had low iron status were more likely to perform better on tasks than those with high iron levels. They also showed greater fatigue attenuation when they received iron from either food or supplements. In this study, we examined the effects of diet on haemologlobin concentration as well as on muscle fatigue. We concluded that iron is a major factor in improving performance in females of reproductive age. At baseline, the ironsufficient women performed better upon cognitive tasks; P =.001 compared with those without iron deficiencies. This paper reports on the efficaciousness of wheat-flourate, electrolyticiron, or hydrogen reduced iron in Indian women with low body iron stores. These results indicate that there are cost-effective strategies for reducing iron desistency in these countries. Fortification of meat sauce is effective because it reduces the frequency of anemia. A double blinded trial was carriedout on 50 men with untimulated entire salivary flow rates and low serum Ferritin. It was found that patients with lower Fe stores did not show any improvement in their health. However, some studies have suggested that eating iron rich foods may improve iron absorption."

24304826,"In this study, we examine the effects of a combination of self-help and nutrition intervention on Type 2 diabetes in urban African American women. The combined intervention has modest changes in blood glucose levels over two years, but does not reach significant significance. Aims: To develop an economic model of how health care is delivered for Type II patients in the United Kingdom. Characterize experiences of type II morbidities; the use of medicine re source among 'a typical Type I diabetes cohort'; and to determine lifetime differences in anticipated health outcomes and cost attributableto Type III. This paper concludes that there are no significant changes with regard to Type 1 or Type 2, although some have suggested that they may be due to confounding factors. It also discusses the effect of community-based breast cancer screening programs on improving health behavior and health status as well as on costs. Mammography remains one of the most cost effective approaches to treating older women with chronic disease. However, these studies do not show any significant change in quality after six months."
25039609,"In a prospective, open-labeled blinded endpoint trial of 2156 patients with syphilis, the authors found no association between achieved bp and risk of stroke or heart attack in the placebo control group. A primary aim of this study was to compare blood pressure control in patients who had left ventricular failure or were not at risk for cardiovascular disease. The results showed that treatment with an angiotesin-converting enzyme inhibitor reduced the rate of death from all causes but those who did not suffer from heart failure. After two years of follow up, sitting gystol and diaspilic blood tensions fell by 10.9mmHg as compared to placebo; after 2 years there were significant reductions in total strokes and other cardiovascular events. This is due to the fact that active treatment prevents many of these complications."
30421960,"In this study, we examine the effects of eight weeks of reveratrol over nineteen patients with Type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that a high-strength diet and exercise regimen is superior to placebo in terms of improving physical function. We conclude that it is possible to detect changes in health after 6 months by using an MRI scan. This study also suggests that ageing may be associated with reduced vascular function because of ""oxidative stress."" A large number of people with type 2dm have been studied for these effects. However, there are few studies examining the efficacy of either regimen."
26848580,"The results of this study indicate that low levels of 25-hydroxyvin D are associated with increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. However, the effect of high-dose vitamin D on vascular function is unknown. In this trial, we examined the association between blood pressure and 25HhD levels in patients who were previously suffering from a stroke. After two weeks, no significant changes were seen in blood flow or arterial stiffness in the treatment group; however, there was an improvement in other measures of health after 16 weeks. This study further investigates the effects of higher doses of daily supplementation on vasodial dilatation as well as improvements in endotolhelial function."
31611148,"The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of a paleolithic ""Old Stone Age"" diet on risk factor for cardiovascular disease among patients with Type 2 diabetes. All diets were compared in terms of weight loss, blood pressure, and body composition. After six months, all diet groups lost significant amounts of fat but no change in other risk factors. In addition, they reduced both levels of total blood-glucosolate by an average of 1.2%. This was not surprising since it had been previously suggested that low-fat/carbohidrate diet would be more effective than high-protein/ketogenic diet because it could lead to greater reductions in LDL cholesterol. Furthermore, these two different diet plans were associated with increases in leptotrophin size, which has been implicated in atherocysmism. These results suggest that the VLCK regimen may have some beneficial effects on weight Loss: It was mainly due to FM mass and strength; Muscular Strength was also assessed."
22935297,"This paper focuses on the effects of a family-based, two-week intervention on fruit and vegetable consumption among young adults. The authors conclude that this intervention will lead to improved health and behavior for people with an unhealthy eating habit. In addition, they suggest that ""implementations that match regulatoryorientation heighten motivation intensity"" and put snacks under deliberate control for those with strong unhealthy habits."
28438641,"In this first study, we examine the effects of fluoxetine on patients with severe anorexaemia who have recovered from their weight loss. The results suggest that there are no significant differences in time to relapse between groups. However, subjects treated with either fexotic or placebo had greater changes in their symptoms than those not treated by either treatment. This is supported by the use of neuroimaging. A group of patients suffering from schizophrenia received 16 weeks of both olanzepine and a nutritional supplement. They undertook passive viewing tasks while their brains were recorded. Brain activity was reduced after the intervention."
31344892,"This paper focuses on the effect of fasting on memory performance in young adults. It compares two fast intervals: morning and afternoon; and blood glucose levels before and after an overnight Fast. The results suggest that high-glycaemiamic meals improve verbal memory and alertness, but there is no relationship between fat or sugar content. In addition, it suggests that skipping breakfast can improve mental performance. A white bread enriched with Guar gum improves brain function over four days. Brain functions are improved by eating a low-glucoemic breakfast."
32161895,"This study focuses on the use of an irrigation device, Endovac, to reduce the amount of time and effort required to remove debris from root canals. The devices are described in detail. In this paper, we compare the efficiency of two different irrigation methods: 1) a negative-apical press device; 2) self-adjusting files; and 3) NiTi instrumentation. We conclude that the newer instruments have greater cleaning capacity than those used before. A comparison of the debridement efficacy between the two groups was made. Both groups showed significant reduction in hard tissue after irrigant activation but were not as effective as the conventional methods. For example, there was no difference in the volume of soft tissue left within the root Canals when compared to the traditional method. All three groups had significantly different levels of debris removal. After six months, all patients returned with pain scores comparable to their pre-injury group. Finally, the aim of this trial was to evaluate whether the endovoid pressure irrigation system is more efficient than other irrigation systems. It was found that it produces less waste at the third of roots than current irrigation techniques."
28003299,"In this paper, we describe the results of a two-year study on Hispanic females with prediabtes. We found that the lifestyle intervention group lost weight and improved metabolic measures after one year, while the control group gained only 1.4 kg. This was an important finding because it showed that there were no significant differences in the risk of type 2 diabetes between the two groups. The main outcome was improvement in blood sugar levels for the intervention subjects. After three years, the change in body weight did not affect the severity of the disease."
18805125,"This paper focuses on the association of blood pressure and the National Cholsterol Education program with coronary disease risk. It uses population-based methods to predict whether people with Type I or Type II diabetes will experience sudden increases in their risk of heart disease. The results are mixed, but there is agreement among the three main risk factors: 1) high-risk subjects, 2) middle-aged patients, and 3) men with preexisting conditions."
28978949,"The narrator continues his story of the Underground Man. He was born and raised in London, where he worked as a prostitute for two years. His father died of tuberculosis at age 7; his mother died from Type 1 diabetes when she became pregnant. In this chapter, the author describes her own childhood experiences with medicine and how she came to be an orphaned child. She also discusses the social status of women in England. Her parents were very close to each other, and they had different levels of education. Their mothers did not know that their children were on the verge of becoming adults. They would have been educated by doctors who knew what they were doing"
29219102,"The purpose of this study is to determine the relevancy and utility of a combination of high-quality evidence from multiple observational studies. In each arm, the results of these studies were compared with that of an unblinding random sample of parents who had children younger than two years. This study was not designed to demonstrate significant differences between the search methods used in the pilot study. Instead, it was intended to measure the relative importance of the different search approaches on the same basis."
22573122,"In this study, we examine the effect of regular moderate intensity physical activity on platelet functions in patients with stable coronary disease. The results suggest that exercise may be a good strategy for reducing the risk of heart attack in people with unstable anginanes. We also report that weight loss is associated with improved endothelic dysfunction in human obese subjects. This study aims to find out whether regular physically active can reduce the risks of hypertension among both men or women. Both single- and joint association of physical activities and body massindex were examined using cox proportionalhazard models. After follow-up, bicycling towork reduced risk by approximately 40 %) after multiplevariate adjustment, including leisuretime physicalactivity."
16418645,"Back pain is a common problem in the school environment, and this paper describes risk factors for back pain among children in Israel. The results suggest that education can be used to reduce the number of young people who suffer from low-back pain. In addition, the intervention reduces the amount of time students spend with their own alcohol use. This study also suggests that teachers may be better able to help students avoid drinking by using harm reduction goals. A comparison between the Australian population and the American population was made. Although there are differences in prevalence of low back Pain, both groups experienced high-Disability Low Back Pain. These differences were related to other health problems, such as absence from school and visits to doctors. Furthermore, these factors seemed to reinforce feelings of disease severity. Thus, they were found to be important predictorsof serious backpain. Schoolchildren were divided into two groups: one group received no training on how to properly wear an appropriate backpack; the other group got only instruction on proper shoulder wear."
24207135,"In this paper, we describe the results of a two-year follow-up study on patients with localized, locally advanced prostatecancer. The overall survival rate was 89 percent for men who received PSA testing at least once and no more than 0.5 nmol/ml. A significant reduction in risk from surgery was seen after adjusting for noncomplications. After comparing outcomes between 36 months of abrogation and 18 months using an adjusted model, it was found that there were no differences in the risks of biochemical or regional failure between arms. However, when compared to control groups, the relative decline in all cause mortality was 21 p.m. over the follow up period. Prostate cancer is particularly common among men with higher levels of prostatic specific antigen. For example, among 2950 men age range 62 to 9 years, prostate disease was detected in 449; 67 out of these four49 cancers had gleason scores of 7 or greater. Men with high-grade disease underwent radical prostatoplasty but did not reduce their risk of death. To further investigate the effect of radiation therapy on post-opportunely advanced disease, We performed an open phaseIII study evaluating endocine therapy with andwithout local radiotherapy followed by castrated on progression. This trial was designed to compare the use of external beamradiation with cryobaptism for localizing disease. It showed improved Biochemy Progress-free survival as vs."" Osteoablation was superior to transrectal 12 core initial prostate biopsy. Urinary toxicity was also noted. Posteriority was significantly improved during the duration of the study. Although some patients required hormonal therapy, only 31 men required both. Overall survival was achieved through combination therapy strongly favoring improved PFS, loco regional control, and metascasis free survival. Outcome Measurments and Statistical Analyses Conclusions There was no significant difference in any outcome between immediate ADT plus retroviral therapy and adjuvant treatment alone in locally advance prostate cancer patients. No significant differences were associated with either group's modality: intermediate-risk patients having Gleasons score 8 or 10. Furthermore, those with low grade disease had better survival rates because they had less lymph nodes. Adjuvant therapy was preferable to short-lived regimens due to its shorter"
18395982,"This paper focuses on the effects of self-care on patients' physical functioning, coping strategies, and beliefs about their back pain. It is a first attempt to examine whether these beliefs are related to professional experiences and professions sought for care. In this study, we investigate how physicians interpret patient behavior in order to predict future health problems. We find that there are three factors associated with physician attitudes regarding treatment of backpain: 1) physicians believe that they should find ""a definitive cause"" and permanent cure; 2) physicians think it is difficult to know what will happen to their patients afterward; and 3) psychological factors seem to play an essential role in the pathos of low back Pain."
30541375,"In this paper, the results of a pilot study are presented. The patients who receive telemedicine treatment have improved their health status and quality of life over time. They report that they spend less time in the hospital than usual care. A further study is performed to determine whether delivering 'telemonitoling' to patients with chronic or acute obstrumentive pulmonary diseases' can reduce the frequency at which they are admitted to the emergency room. This trial was conducted in Italy. It showed that there was no difference in mortality, time to admittance, mean amount of readmission for both groups. There was also no significant difference among the two groups regarding the severity of the disease. Both groups had different levels of anxiety and depression. However, neither group seemed to change significantly in terms of self-reporting exercise time nor physical functioning. These changes were not significant enough to justify an intervention in general. Another study was carried out to evaluate the effects of ""home based telmonitory system"" on the effect of heat stress on clinical and function status in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."" Although it was well used, it did not lead to improvements in patient health."
25012720,"This study shows that using step goals and instant feedback from an pedometer can be effective in improving physical activity levels among overweight and obese older women. The results suggest that exercise adherence is relevant when prescribbing exercise regimens to also focus on declining pain and body mass. In addition, studies of physically activity are limited to leisure activities or physical movement at work. However, this study suggests that a combination of steps and immediate feedback may be useful for increasing physical function in older adults who have knee osteoarthrits. A Pedometer-Driven Walking program was found to be more effective than education and advice only for treating patients with knee Osteoartritis. Arthritas, Diet, and Athletic Promotion Trial was based on the results of two different walking groups: one group led by glucotine sulate and the other by diet plus exercise. Both groups lost significant amounts of body weight during their follow-up periods. Although there were no significant differences between these groups, it was not known whether ""structured physical action programmes"" were any more efficacious than giving advice about staying active. Back pain sufferers often receive poor treatment because they do not attend regular physical exercises. Therefore, back pain patients should be given daily exercises as part of their routine."
15977010,"This paper describes the results of a two-week self-assessment of health status in patients with acute rheUMAtoidarth disease. The outcome measures are highly reproducible, but there is little evidence for their reliability. In contrast, the American College Of Rheumate and the OutCome MeasuresinClinicalTrials conference committee have recommended that physicians and patient-global measures be used in trials of chronic diseases. However, neither instrument is superior to tender joints count; neither is statistically superior. A core set of outcomes proposed by theAmerican College of Rhematology and Omeract was also examined. Physician and Patient-Global measures were most responsive instruments, although neither did statisticalally superior: tender joint count. Conclusive this study provides further proof that the core sets of outcome measure proposedby the Americans Collegeof Rhumatologie and/or the outcome measures in clinical trials were the most respondable instruments. All pain measures -- 10-cm visceral analog scale, VAS,, 5 point categoricalscale & Arthoris impact Measurement Scores - were compared. These findings constitute justification for more applications of these measures to medical trials as they relate to naivete or long-term observational studies. Four pain measurements -- 10 Cm visual analog score, Vass, vasometric strength, articular index, cochin scale 'and problem elicit technique' -- were validated. They showed good agreement on the original Vavican scale at least 0.89 whereas no significant trend was observed between the scores. Forty eight joints were chosen to reflect characteristic pattern ofthe disease. To evaluate the effect of gradeing tenderness on an articular Index, three physicians performed independent joint scores upon each of 18 subjects. Their results suggest that close agreement could be achieved on both the absolute presence nor absence of tenderity of individual joints. An  articulater index was devisted for the sequential evaluation of patients With Ostearthritis. It was sufficiently sensitive when grading quality of affection on it. Sensitsivity of five Health Status Question naireswas studied in hospitalized patients who had active arthritis."
32191359,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the differences between the two branches of public health practice. He discusses the use of controlled trials to assess the efficacy of different types of government spending and how they are used to predict changes in health over time. His main focus is on improving mental health for low-wage families who live in high poverty neighborhoods. However, his study does not reveal any direct effects on physical health or long-term outcomes. This paper also addresses some of the misconceptions that have been raised about the uses of experimental methods in public policy."
31810222,"In this study, we investigate the effect of two-part ethylchlorate solution on bond strength of tooth-bonding systems. The results indicate that there are significant differences in the strength and hardness of the three different types of self-etching adhesives: Adper single bond 2, clearfil se bond, and two step self detachment. A total of 78 bovine centralincisor specimens were prepared for dentin bonding. Bonding was performed at an in-vito level with no degradation occurring over time."
24175602,"This paper describes a novel exercise program for older adults who suffer from knee pain. It is shown that the program improves their physical function and health, but does not increase their selfefficacy. In addition, it shows that patients with knee problems are more likely to be able to follow this program than those who do not. The authors conclude that this study has demonstrated that patient education can be used in primary health care as well as improving self-perception of health as much as function in any degree, although not self efficaciacy; furthermore, they have found no significant differences between the two groups."
31796090,"This study focuses on the association between preoperative complications and sarcopenia in patients with color-ectal carcinoma. The results suggest that sedentism is associated with more severe post-opportunities, particularly for patients who have muscle depletions. A nomography of the independent risks of dreadful IAI was constructed to estimate the individual risk factors. In this study, we examine the relationship between visceral Fat and Post-Operative Complications after radical ghastectomy. We conclude that there are no significant relationships between skeletal Muscle Mass and Perioperatic Risk. Furthermore, it is concluded that laparoscopie-assured operation is a protective feature for overall and medical complications."
19366379,"Both drugs are well tolerated in treating patients with moderate or severe obsessure-compulsed disorder. The subjects who receive sertraline show a greater likely remission than those treated with either fluoxetine or other antipsychotic, but quetiamipine does not separate from placebo among the sub-section of subjects with comorbid symptoms. In this case, Quetitia pine fails to separate as an augmentation to serotonein reabsorption inhibitors in treatment-prone OCD patients. A double-blinded, parallel- group, flexible- dose, placebo- controlled study of quetitiapino augmenter in subjects whom had responded inadequateally to open- label treatment with an epilepsy drug for 12 weeks was performed. Four patients showed moderate improvement of at least 25 %) reduction in Yo-Bocs scores in Oodyssive Compulsives disease. This trial is designed to assess changes in the presence of Serotonin Transporter during the course of SRI therapy and relate these improvements to improvements of patient's symptoms; no significant differences were found between treatment arms. Seventy adults with cured Oclession-Compulsesive disorder received 12 weekly treatments with Clomipramine or Sertriline. Although both drugs demonstrated superior efficacy, they did not produce any significant change in side effects. Fluvoxine was also more effective in preventing dropsout due to ""relapse"" or insufficient response after 16 or 52 weeks of single blind trials. No adverse events occurred related to drug consumption. Two studies investigated whether fluvoXamine could increase the overall responder in patients suffering from obsessesively compulsious disorder: one study reported that it was better to add quatipine to clonanzepam than to use placebo; the other study examined whether adding Quartipure would improve the outcome in such patients when compared to using placebo."
27966571,"A large-scale, prospective study evaluating the effects of high-dose cholecaliferol on body composition, fat distribution, and insulinsensitivity among postmenopauseal women. The results suggest that daily doses of 1,500 ng/d or 1,100 iu per day may have some beneficial effects on these outcomes. In addition, there are no significant differences in blood concentrations between the two groups. This is a phase IV, rand and ommized, doubleblind, placebo controlled trial. Further studies are needed to confirm this effect. Biomarkers such as leptenin, angiogenesis, bone mineral dentition, basal morphology, etc. were collected at baseline and after treatment. These studies provide further evidence for the efficacy of vitamin D in type 2 diabetes."
25277808,"In this study, Turku University's central hospital has supported a large number of studies on the effects of daily dietary and lifestyle changes on vitamin D levels in children. The results suggest that there is little difference in the risk of stress fracture among children who have low levels of blood concentration of 25-hydroxyd. A significant risk for fatigue bone injury occurs when subjects with high-25-OHD levels are at risk. This suggests that 3,000 iu/d may be an inexpensive intervention to prevent excessive injury from military recruits."
12804478,"A randomized, placebo-assisted study evaluating the safety andefficacy of once-delivered XR in patients with generalised anxiety disorder without major depressed disorder. The results suggest that venlafine is superior to other antidepressant agents on the Hamilton Score for anxiety and CGI scales. In addition, there is a significant increase in the frequency of cooccurrence of anxiety disorders among subjects with Generalized Anxious Disorder."
23818412,"A supervised exercise program for patients who have a severe form of fibroma is shown to improve physical and mental function, pain, stiffness, anxiety, depression, and quality-of-life. After six months, the treatment group shows significant improvements in both quality of life as well as functional consequences. The results are sustained for 6 months after the intervention. In addition, there are no significant differences in the severity of symptoms between the two groups. This study concludes that an 8-month exercise regimen can be cost effective in comparison to other forms of exercise."
31228362,"In this paper, the authors present a description of their trial and then describe how they report their results. They conclude that physical activity improves brain function in preadodylescent children by improving executive function from pretest until posttest. The intervention group shows greater improvements from pretest to post test in inhibition and flexibleness than control groups. This is an important finding because it suggests that exercise may have beneficial effects on older people's health. More research needs to be done about the different exercise-resources that contribute to these changes. Acute resistance exercise can increase the performance of cognitive tasks in older adults. These studies suggest that chronic exercise might be associated with improved mental health in elderly subjects. Sixtie young male adults are assigned to either ""a closed skill,"" ""brisk walking or jogging,"" or ""control"" conditions. Their neurocognital performance remains unchanged even when confounding factores are controlled for."
21029469,"The results of the first three- and twelve-month studies suggest that a lifestyle intervention can be used to prevent Type 2 diabetes in primary care. In particular, there is growing evidence that diet and exercise are effective at reducing the risk of complications from elevated blood sugar levels. Although these patients do not experience significant reductions in their risk for developing Type 2, they report improvements in body weight, height, waist circumferentiality, and blood pressure. These findings support the notion that lifestyle changes may be more effective than conventional approaches in preventing type 2 disease."
25919402,"In this study, we examine the effects of a combination of self-reporting hearing loss and quality of life measures on patients who receive weekly home lessons. The results show that the training group has improved their overall health while the controls have no significant change in their scores. This paper describes the concept of an ""audiological rehabilitation"" program designed to engage the elderly listeninger in the Hearing Aid Fitting process; provide listening strategies, build confidence, and address psychological changes characteristic of age. A short-term observational study is performed to evaluate the benefits of providing pre- or post fitting hearing aids as an adjunct for hearing assistive treatment for individuals with acquired hearing Loss. Although there are some differences between the two groups, it is clear that both groups benefit from the same type of therapy. For example, one group receives regular speech perception training but does not receive any other form of training. Another group attends monthly telephone consultations where they learn how to use their hearing devices. These visits reduce the frequency of complaints by up to three times per week. However, the cost of these visits is much higher than that of individual hearing assistance fitting."
20642296,"In this study, we investigate the protective effects of aprobiotics on infants with acute and recurrent allergic urtics. We conclude that early dietary intervention can prevent or delay these adverse effects. Four weeks later, CMA is diagnosed with milk-challenge in which he receives either Lactobacilus GG, containing four strains of probiotic yeasts, or placebo. After treatment, Iga levels tend to be higher among proicrobial groups than those of the placebo group; however, the effect of anti-allergic disease remains unexplored. This study furthermore examines the impact of education on children with eczyma. The results suggest that education may reduce the severity of symptoms but not improve quality of life."
27460044,"In this paper, the authors discuss the evidence for the use of vitamin D as a preventative measure against fractures in older adults. They conclude that there is no significant difference between the groups at one week, one month, or six months of treatment on any measures of strength. The results suggest that it is best to take 5,000 IU of 1,25 dihydroxyvitaminD1 every day which is sufficient to achieve adequate levels of muscle strength and bone mineral density. Aim: To examine the effects of 6-month daily supplementation with Calcium andcholecalcificerol on Biochemical Parameters and Muscle Strength of Institutionalized Elders. This study was designed to assess the effect of resistance training on physical performance among elderly subjects who had low 25-hydroxyvindemia concentrations; they were then divided into three groups. One group received 1,000 iu/day of calcium and another 800 mg per day of alfavalcidol. After nine months, gait speeds improved more in the trained group than in nonsupplemented subject's either group. Results: No severe adverse events related to these medicines occurred throughout the trial. Ca has been found to be an important nutrient but does not seem to affect bone health in children or postmenopause. However, some studies have suggested that high blood pressure may be associated with increased risk of falls. Therefore, patients with low-25-OHD status should be given higher doses of caviar."
25430608,"Losartan reduces blood pressure in a large, well-controlled trial in patients with essential hypertensity. The relative risk ratio for developing heart disease is 0.89, compared to the modified Friskingham score of 0.012; P0.051. In addition, weight loss and exercise result in greater reductions in both BP and total cholesterol. A diet high in fruits, vegetables, and low fat dairy products results in an improvement in body composition, fitness, insulinsensitivity,and fasting phospholipids. This study determines whether the DASH meal pattern can be used to prevent hypertension in type 2 diabetes. It has been shown that the original Dash diet was effective in relieving bp by reducing small artery elongation but there is little evidence regarding its efficacy in free-living conditions."
30165599,"In this study, we examine the effects of different  diets on blood pressure and body weight in healthy subjects. The results suggest that high-fat, low-facies diet does not have any deleterious effects on both postprano and ieal hemostasesis. We also compare the effect of replacing fat with monounsaused fatty acids on endotolhelial function or arterial stiffness. A recent large-scale trial has shown that the Mediterranean style diet reduces glyceride concentrations in high risk cardiovascular patients. This study is further supported by an extended European cohort study suggesting that a highly adherence to such dietary regimens is associated with reduction in mortality."
18683044,"In this paper, we describe 'a hybrid trial design approach that required a dramatically small sample size than those of sth and ard Noninferriority designs'. We compare fulverant to anastrozale in post-menopausal women with breastcancer who are not treated with antisteroidals. The results suggest that the new treatment is more effective and tolerated than either of these two regimens; however, some patients receive another entdocrine therapy after their disease has progressed. This paper also discusses the use of ""equivalency and noninfioriability"" trials as methods for evaluating new treatments."

In this study, we examine the incidence, predictors, and progogue value of new atrial fiilation following transcatheliter  Aorticvalve insertion. No acute or long-term followup results were obtained in 44 patients after Tavi. At 30 days, no adverse events occurred; however, none occurred during 2.5 percent of 244) of office visits and 5 % of 10 of 27 hospitals.

15480707,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective, observational study in which we compare the efficacious use of two different antimicrobial agents for treatment of children with acute and perforatedappendicitiis. We conclude that both regimens are effective in treating these patients. The mean time for hospitalization is reduced from 32.7 days in groups A to 152 days after group B. There are no major complications in either group except for one case of severe diarrehoeA. Both groups have very similar duration of treatment. Major complications include abscesses, cecalfstula, wound infection, and no minor bowel obstruction required operation. All patients recover uneventfully during their follow-up period. Children with perorated or  Gangrenous appeniciitis become clinically stable after medicine and/or surgical intervention but often remain on the hospital solelly to complete parentersal antibiotic therapy. Sixteen children between 2.5 and 16 years of age were hospitalized for an appendectomy due to suspected acute Appendix. No serious complications were found; only one readmitted for intestinal obstruction. Only one patient required reoperation."
17054183,"In this study, we examine the immune status of 12 infants who were fed soy-peptide formulas for a year. Immune response to Haemonophilus influenza type b, tevatanus, diphtheeria, and  Poliovirus at six, 7 and 12 months. The results indicate that breast feeding is associated with reduced risk of asthma in children older than 6 years. Atopic disease is more common in cow's milk but not in dairy products. Children who have never been breastfed are less likely to develop asthma or wheeze during their first three months; however, they do show improved growth when they receive either cow ""milk"" or soY formula. Allergies are most frequently caused by cows' milk, although there is some evidence that using cow feed may reduce the severity of allergic disease. Cow'll milk is used as an anti-adrensolate treatment in patients with severe cow meat allergy. However, it does not improve the symptoms of colic in these patients."
28771519,"Pregnant women were divided into two groups: the first group was given a control diet, and the second group received probiotics or placebo. The results of the trial showed that the lower glyciamic load diet did not reduce pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women with Type 2 diabetes mellitate. In this study, we compared the effects of an appropriate low-carbidohydrate/hyperfat diet on blood lipid management and pregnancy outcome in women who had gestational type 2 disease. We found no significant differences between body weight gain, birth weight, or other maternal health perinatal events between the two different groups. This study is aimed at comparing the effect of ""a general  diet intervention"" and an intervention using low Glycemic Loaf's diet to improve blood glucose control, blood lipolysis,and pregnancy endpoints in females with Gessida Mellitus. It was performed by ninety- five women from June 2008 until July 2009. They were all assigned either high fiber or low carbohidrate diet according to their gender. These studies revealed that there was no difference in infant brain development when they were fed the conventional low fat diet. A further study was designed to determine whether it was possible to reduce the need for insulin without compromiseing pregnancy quality. Women with GDM were included in this pilot study. After four weeks of treatment, fastingblood samples were taken at base and after 4 more weeks treated with the DASH eating plan. Fasting plasma glucose, Hba1c levels, as well as pregnancy outcomes were measured. Both diets reduced the risk of premature birth and increased the frequency of insulin required by both patients."
31906372,The results of this first study suggest that a probiotic-rich cheese may be more effective in preventing and reducing the risk of heart disease in women with syphilis than in controls.
22510792,"The effects of a reduced energy diet on weight loss were investigated in postmenopauseal women. In the first study, we found no significant changes in bone mineral density among overweight post-menorous women with hypertension; in the second trial, however, there was no difference in low-dension lipoprotein and increased high blood pressure among those with hypotension. A reduction-energy diet provided improved urinary calcium exretion but also improved bone loss over four mo of weight Loss caused bone Mineral loss. At 6 month, participants assigned to each diet lost an average amount of 6 kg which represented 7 percent of their initial body weight. After 12 months, they lost more than 10 kg in both groups. This suggests that poorer carbohydrate consumption may lead to mood deteriorations in overweight subjects."
11406040,"In this paper, we describe the effect of a calcium-channel blocker on pregnant women's blood pressure. The results are similar to those of other drugs: there is no significant difference between the maternal and child health in the treated groups; however, they do have some side effects. We conclude that treatment with an antihypertensionant like oxprinol or metoprololil will be more effective for controlling pregnancy-induced hypotension than any other drug. A double blind trial is carried out whereby 19 patients with preclampsis are assigned to either treatment or placebo. They receive either medication for five days or six days respectively. There is little difference in mean arterial pressure during the first two trimesters of pregnancy. No significant changes in birth weight, age, gestational height, or Apgar score were found in both groups. Both drugs improve the quality of newborn life. Pregnancies complex with pregnancy hypertension are divided into sub-groups accordingto the type of disease which was the base for used antihystertensive agents. Methmyldopardia is better tolerated by all but one patient who develops significant proteinuricity. This study compares the efficaciousness of alpha-methemode against ketansin in treating pregnancy caused hyper tension. It shows that it has no negative effects on fetal growth and improvement in renal functions."
26844102,"This is a controlled trial designed to assess the effects of an intervention for postpartum females with Type 2 diabetes. The women are assigned to one of two treatment groups: 1) adherence to routine medical care during the first year of the trial, or 2) usual care after the initial period of follow-up. Women in this group receive blood tests, anthropometry, and selfreported quality of life, depression, risk perception, health service usage at baseline and twelve months later. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of physical activity delivered to post partum women via short message service. We find that walking increases the frequency of exercise in both groups. A further study is performed to investigate changes in body weight and body mass over time. There is no significant change in either group. However, there is an association between physical activities and reduced risk of type 2 disease. Furthermore, these results suggest that lifestyle intervention may be effective in preventing such complications as pregnancy weight loss."
30086061,"In this study, we compare the short term quality of life in patients treated with fast track surgery versus conventional care. The results suggest that the use of fasttrack surgery improves patient recovery and reduces post-operative complications. We also examine the effect of different surgical approaches on blood cell count and immune function in elderly patients who undergo elective color censure."
28298219,"In this paper, we examine the relationship of sedenty and physical activity with pregnancy weight gain and risk of pre-term birth. We find no significant differences in total sleeping time, light pa, or exercise between women who met Physicians' recommended standards during mid-pregnancy and those who didnot. However, there is a significant difference in sleep duration for pregnant women that meet physician's recommendations. For example, at week 18 only moderately vigorous activities were associated with lower birth weight. The study concludes by examining the effect of an exercise intervention on maternal health outcomes."
23597181,"In this study, we examine whether enzlutamide can prolong survival in patients with castration resistance after chemotherapy. The results of the 5- retractase trial are described. Men aged 18 to 60 years were compared between placebo plus testosterone and dutastesteride plus testosterone from May 2005 until June 2010. This trial was stopped after an interim analysis at time of 530 deaths. A total survival rate of 18.4 months was achieved in the naive group versus 17.3 months in both groups. There was also a significant reduction in risk of death in men who received low free and Bioavailable testosterone levels. Both groups showed increased bone mineral density and improved quality of life. Although there was no change in disease activity or muscle mass, there were no significant differences in leanbody mass or fat mass. Meta-analysis is performed on reports of randomised controlled trials that have been published since January 1, 2006."
31384474,"This is a small, well-controlled study of the effects of wearable activity trackers on patients who are not involved in regular cardiac rehabilitation. The results suggest that physical activity may be an effective intervention for improving health and quality of lives among older adults with Iddell disease. In addition, it has been reported that exercise tracking devices can reduce strenuous bouts by encouraging step counts. A further study investigates the use of ""consumer-wearable device"" to improve fitness in post-myocardial injury patients. Although there is no evidence of any significant change in health outcomes after six months of follow-up, this trial does not report any changes in patient health or behavior."
29561067,"In this study, we examine the effects of haloperidone on acute psychotic disease. Haloperodol induces oxidative stresses in patients with severe acute psychological problems. A previous trial with antioxidant N-AC showed significant improvements in symptoms and function in chronic patients. This study further investigates the use of taurine as an antipsychotic for patients who have a single bout of schizophrenia. The subjects were followed up two years without any relapses. After devastating floods in southern Alberta during June 2013, we attempted to repeat 'a New Zeals and rand and Omized trial' that showed that small amounts of mineral or vitamins improved mental health. All groups showed considerable decreases on these measures, but those consuming ""the BComplex"" and the Brussel Syndrome Mammogram formulas showed greater improvement in anxiety and stress than those eating only one nutrient. Further research is needed to determine whether consumption of multiple nutrients reduces risk of progressing to major depressive illnesses. We conclude that long-chain omega 3 polyunstained fatty acids are essential for brain development and functions. Our results suggest that treatment with E-EPA may be more effective in treating milder forms of depression."
24287215,"In this paper, the effects of a six-week home-based exercise regimen on patients with hip replacement are investigated. The results show that there is no significant difference in gait speed or cadence between patients assigned to either group of exercises at the beginning of the study or after the intervention. A comparison of time and intensity of physical therapy was made for patients who had been treated with total hiparthroplasty but were not given any improvement in their quality of life."
22852063,"Pregnant women with low zinc concentrations during pregnancy receive greater amounts of zinc than those with higher levels. Women with lower zinc are more likely to have shorter gestations and larger birth weights. Despite improving maternal and newborn zinc status, the effects of adding zinc to pre-pregnatant iron and folictable tablet do not alter duration of pregnancy nor size at birth. In addition, mothers receiving zinc have higher cord zinc concentrates than that of mothers without zinc. This study aims to determine whether maternal or neonatal infant growth is affected by either increased or reduced daily zinc consumption."
25843244,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates that both an employer-directed low-cost education program and small financial incentives similarly lowers the risk of long- term weight loss in college students. He concludes by stating that exercise is the most effective predictor of short-term weight Loss: ""The prudent pattern scores represent high intakesof vegetables, fruit, legumes, fish, poultry, and whole grain whereas high western pattern Scores reflected high levels of red meat, processed meat; refined grains, French fries,and sweetsedeserts"". The results of these studies suggest that dietary patterns are not as important as they should be for improving health outcomes. For example, overweight patients who receive physical activity treatment lose more weight than those who do not receive it. This study also examines whether incentive-based reinforcement can be used to reduce smoking behavior among women with pregnant or postpartum pregnancy."
24529799,"The results of this study show that the two-step system provides the best surface roughness, while the four- step system produces the most stan-resistant groups. A comparison is made between the three different types of polishing systems used in this paper: 1) Filtek Supreme, 2) Sof-lex, 3) Super-snapsap, and 4) Enhance Polanding. Results are compared by two way analysis of variance with Tukey's test. Both systems provide the highest surface smoothness. However, they do not show any significant differences in color stability over time. Six specimens were treated with each of the bleaching agents according to the instructions. Thirteen disc-shaped samples were assigned to three groups; a control group and two experiment groups According to these treatment regimens, the surfaces were polished with an aluminum oxide disc for 12 days. In addition, there was no significant difference in the overall appearance of all the examined composites. As if to further confirm this conclusion, several other tests were carried out on the same subject. These included Fourier spectroscopies at f/irm and scanning electron microscopes"
19555517,"The effect of garlic in patients with Type 2 diabetes is primarily due to the increased content of the first two major lipids, total and lipophosphoryl. After 12 weeks, the effects are not significant. In fact, there is no significant difference between the initial levels of these two groups. A double blinded cross-over study compares the efficacious effects of garlic extract with that of atorvastain on blood cholestrol concentrations in subjects with primary type 1 hypercholesteremic disease. This study concludes that garlic can be used as an effective anti-thrombotic agent for patients who have moderately elevated cholesterol."
23152283,"Pre-Optractive and Post-Admission Measures of Mortality in Heart Surgeons Between 1996 and 2001 At a single center, risk factors for patients who undergo heart surgery are prospectively collected. Discriminating power for 30 day and 1-year mortalities in cardiac surgery is highest for logistic, 0.84 and 1.77 Aims To compare nine risk score algorithms to their validity as predictors for thirty-day and one-year mortality after cardinal surgery. In the case of coronary arteries bypassing only surgery, Euroscore followed by NewY State, and Cleveland and Clinic risk scores showed the highest predictive power among these four groups. Preoperative and postopratory peak expiratory capacity, inspiratoury capacity, post-operating ventilation time,post-operative pulmonary complication After caBG surgery was found in both groups significantly lower before or after surgery respectively than normal values compared to mean values. The role that pre-opitory musculolysis plays in improving plenial function before and after surgical intervention has been examined for thefirst time prospectically. These studies suggest that short term pulmonary rehabilitation can reduce the incidence of preptotic complications and length of postoperative stay in patients with high risk of developing an obstructosis undergoing cabital surgery; this study suggests that ""preoperative immuture short-term lung rehabilitation"" may be more effective than conventional care in reducing morbidity during the first two weeks of recovery."
29336593,"In this study, we examine the effects of extended daily iron therapy on anemia, weight, and height in infants from a poor socioeconomic background. The results indicate that there is no significant difference in motor tests scores after 3 months and 6 months. A controlled trial was conducted to determine whether extended-oral iron treatment would improve developmental test scores in children with iron-does not lead to improved health status or absenteeiism. After three months, blood concentrations were reduced by vitamin A than by either group alone. This study also examined the effect of iron plus folic Acid or iron + folate combined with vitaminA. It showed that both groups had better hemoglobin levels than they did when only one type of nutrient was present. Hemogen concentration increased significantly more afterwards supplementation with Iron + floric acid oriron + Fe alone; these results suggest that iron deficitiency is most common in developing countries. Anemia in coastal east Africa is complex. Ninet hundred-nine childages aged 1 y were separated into four groups. Vitamin A benefits hematology condition and Fe metabolic function. Both vitamins produce significant elevations as well as reductions in ferritin saturation and serum haemolin concentration. Children who have malaria at enroll experience  747 g/year higher yearly gain attribuable to VDA than those without malaria. Infants are assigned to oral dosages of 200 IU per day for improvement in their growth and development. They receive additional doses over 4 and 8 weeks after discharge."
24717342,"In this study, we examine the effect of a palmitic-rich diet on blood lipid concentrations. The subjects consume three different diets: 1) high-fat coconut oil; 2) palmoleine acid; and 3) palm-knernel oil. We conclude from these studies that palmic acid is superior to trans greasy acids in reducing total cholesterol and lipophosphorylation. Furthermore, our results indicate that both fats are more effective at preventing heart disease than their other fatty oils. A cross-over study compares the effects of two different types of fat -- palm or steric acid -- on serumlipoprotein levels. Both were found to be significantly lower in men and women with an averaged plasma cholesterol concentration between 6 and 10 mmol per day. These results suggest that ""palmiatic acid"" may be as effective for lowering LDLcholesterol as it is for improving HDL content."
29168154,"In this study, we examine the effect that a combination of probiotic and chlorhexion-based treatments has on the severity of scarlet fever in children. We conclude that these two treatment regimens have significant efficacy in treating patients with pharngotonsillitis. The results of the first trial suggest that use of an extended course of antibiotics can be used as an alternative to standard care for patients suffering from haliToss. This paper also describes the effects of chewing Gulliver's ""probiotic"" capsules on malodor. It shows that the concentration of active bacterial compounds is reduced when the capsule contains Lactobacilles salivarius Wb21, but no apparent side effects are observed."
29793496,"In this study, the authors report that a new form of soy-derived piitol has been shown to reduce blood sugar levels in patients with Type I and Type II diabetes. They conclude that this new treatment will be safe and efficacious. The results of this trial suggest that using piniol may be useful in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in women with type II. Six of 10 women in the Dchio-inosel group vexed in comparison with two of the 10, 20 p.m. in placebo group. This is an important finding because it shows that combined nutriceuticals can significantly reduce bothcholesterolemia and low-density-c values in elderly patients who have been statin-inergic. A recent study suggests that combination of coconut polyphenols, myotel, and sorceanine could be effective in treating hypercholestremic patients. These compounds were found to induce significant reductions in total lipid-C and reduced high-D lip- C by 6 months."
30544168,"The effects of long- term weight loss on renal parenchial fat, an escort to the hospital, are described. In this paper, we examine the effect of a Mediterranean diet on weight Loss and risk factors in patients with abdominal obesity. We conclude that low-fat consumption may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease by metabolic processes involved with ""apoCIII"" -- small dense low density Lipoprotein. This study is designed to determine whether or not high-carbidohydrate foods can be used to reduce blood cholesterol levels. After six months, all four diets lose significant amounts of body weight. All three include reductions in fasting lipophospholipid concentrations as well as changes in insulin resistance. These results suggest that these two different approaches might be effective for weight management."
31613390,"A third of the reviews in this paper contain at least one study with high suspicion that outcome reporting bias. The majority of these studies do not include full results for the primary outcome, and only a third contains evidence for weight loss. In addition, many of them have no significant differences between the treatment group and the placebo group. For example, patients given fluoxetine lose 4.5+ /-4.0 kg more than those who received placebo 1.4 + -- 0.1 kg. This is due to the fact that fat is associated with increased health risks. More than half of all Cochesrane review papers contained some form of bias; however, there were no single meta-analysis or cross-examinations on any particular outcome. Thus, it was necessary to assess the prevalence of ""outcome report bias"" as well as its impact on the overall quality of evidence."
32152453,"In this study, we investigate the effects of a delayed bp-lowering regimen on blood pressure in subjects with moderately high systelic blood levels. We conclude that treatment with fosolopril for four years results in reducing the risk of death by 45 % in those treated with it compared to placebo. After follow-up, our results suggest that this regimen will be beneficial for patients with mild hypertension and low to moderate CVD risk."
21272751,"In this study, we examine the ambulator blood pressure response to an antihyportensive drug in patients of Eastern African descent. We conclude that chlorthalidene and acetinothiazde are more effective at reducing bp than either agent; however, they do not lead to significant changes in diatolic limb mass. The results of this trial suggest that treatment with an angiotension-converting enzyme blocker such as ramipriml or hctz is superior to conventional therapy in terms of reduction of BP. This paper also describes a double blind, open-labeled cross-sectional study of 6083 subjects who had been treated for hypertension. They were followed for about 4.1 years and their total number of cardiovascular events was compared with those of multivariates proportionalhazards. After two months, blood tension had reduced to similar extent in each group: 26/12 mm hag / Hg awake by >120/80 vacular geometry was alter consistent with the decrease in distended pressure resulting in venous remodelling Although Diuretic therapy only appears to be more efficacious in treating older subjects, only therapy without an inhibitor is associated with increased regression of left ventricular masses. Both drugs have no negative effects on blood flow but mild adverse reactions occur. Two-dimension echocardiograms and freeh heart rate measurements are performed at both ends of the study. At the conclusion of all studies, there is little evidence of adverse events except one case of hypokaemia. Three-dimensional echo chestography and three-Dear Heart Rate Monitoring are carried out at baseline and afterwards. Blood pressure has declined significantly in both groups after 12 months of treatment. These results indicate that ACE-blocker therapy is better tolerated than other treatments. A further study shows that exercise training induces greater improvements in body mass and lowers mean arterial pressure during some work hours. However, these results are not comparable to those obtained from placebo."

No difference was detected in term of NEC risks reduction, but this treatment did reduce NAC of Bell stage 2, or more"" -- an important outcome for neonates who had not been fed before birth. Conclusive results showed that oral L Reuteri did not seem to effect the overall ratesof N Eccoritation and All cause Mortality in preterminate infantses. Preterm Infants were assigned to either group after birth until their body weight reached 1900 g. They were then treated with LacTobacillus G 10 m. per day as well as regular feedings at 1 hour's time. After birth, they were placed in the hospital where they received feeds equal to 100 lb/day. Both groups receive treatment of disease. Late-onset Sepsis continues to be an alarming risk factor for deaths among premature newborns because it is associated with prolonged hospital stay. However, studies have shown that late-on sepSis can be prevented through use of antimicrobials such as Cloxicillin plus Amikachin."

20091582,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of selfefficacy theories on older adults with back pain. He concludes that exercise is more effective in relieving pain and improving physical function than any other form of treatment. This paper also discusses the use of Tai Chi exercises to treat patients with chronic neck pain as well as an outpatient exercise program for older people with knee pain who are not fit to be physically active. The results show that both groups have significant improvements in their ability to walk, bend, and perform health-related activities. Anderson conclude by stating that ""self-efficiecity theory has great Potential for empowering sufferingers of chronic diseases to live with themselves."""
29462641,"The BMC-Aers are used to assess the predictability of brains stem, middle delay and cortically-recorded auditory responses in infants with preterm birth. At 5 years of age, the neuropsychological outcome is assessed from neurological and psychological evaluations. Preterm babies exhibit lower scores on the Boston phonogram than their controls. This study further investigates the association between mismatch negativeity and object naming abilities in prematurelyborn children. In this second study, we examine the effect of mismatched negativity on early learning ability in preterminated children at term-equivocal age."
30395694,"A randomed control trial compares two social communication intervention strategies for young children on the basis of their language skills. Children in both groups improved significantly more than those in the control group when they were given time to practice joint attention, gesture, and language. The results suggest that the picture-exchange system can successfully teach generalized means about showing coordinated attention without requiring eyes to children with an orphaned child's eye contact. In this study, we examine the effects of increased milieu teaching on language learning from parents and a therapist who are also trained in autistic disorders. We conclude that there is no significant difference in language and social functioning between the two groups at each time points. Parents perceive better changes in their children after receiving one of three treatment approaches: parent-teacher training, community-based intervention, or prelinguistic milieu teaching. Both groups showed improvement in verbal and speech skills during follow-up visits. However, neither group was able to achieve improvements in other measures of social function. This study reports further results from another controlled trial of early intervention for infants with autism. It found that mothers received greater responsiveness and time together as well as higher levels of engagement in parenting activities."
21567221,"The results of a self-management program for heart failure patients were reported in this paper. In the treatment group, there was no significant improvement in knowledge level, amount of activity, and qualityof life. There was also no difference in blood pressure or energy expenditure between the two groups. A secure and easy web-based record system of vital Signs and health behaviors was developed. Results remained uncertain. Only the intervention group showed an increase in the knowledge levels, amounts of exercise,and quality of life; and reduction in symptoms of heart failing. This study uses social cognitive theory to predict physical activity through it effect on selfefficacy. It found that both groups experienced improvements in their functional status and disease-specific symptoms. Both groups received more frequent exercise training than usual care during the follow-up period. However, they did not show any changes in other health behavior or health utilization. These studies are needed to further extend these findings."
22760566,"In this chapter, the narrator continues to discuss the state of affairs in the United States. He discusses the current situation with his readers and how it has changed over the past few years. The gist of the story is that there are two kinds of people: those who live on the upper end of society, and those whom live at the lower end--the wealthy and powerful. These people are generally more educated than the average American; they're also less likely to be poor or have higher social status."
23372566,"A community-based, culturally tailored diabetes lifestyle intervention is shown to improve blood glucose control among Latinos and African Americans with Type 2 diabetes. The results of this intervention are compared with that of a group receiving similar care in another health care system. This study concludes that the combination of an exercise program, nutrition education, and behavior change strategies can result in improved physical activity for older adults with disease."
24445948,"In this study, we examine the effects of a combination of testosterone and osteroid replacement therapy on men with benign prostatic disease. The results suggest that these two treatments may be superior to other treatment options in reducing the risk of Aur or BPH related surgery. We also assess the efficacy of transdermal testosterone for improving bone mineral density in elderly men who have low levels of serum testosterone. Although there are some side-effects, such as increased lean mass and reduced bone resorbment, it is concluded that short term treatment does not lead to any significant changes in body composition or muscle strength. However, age-related biological changes may result in reductions in Lean Body Mass, Muscle Strength and Cardio endurance, which can partially reverse in older people with gh/sex steroidal treatment. These studies do not seem to have any serious adverse effects; however, they indicate that ""age-relating hormonal changes"" may contribute to declines among healthy elderly subjects. For example, blood deoxypyrinoline decreases significantly after 26 weeks but is not significantly reduced by the placebo group. This study concludes that although there was beneficial effects from GH and Sex Steroid treatment on body quality, muscle performance, and cardiac endurance -- indicating that more research needs to be done about the safety of these regimens -- there were no significant negative effects. After 6 months, urine deoxipyridinousline had remained unchanged at both the T+F and T1 only groups, but did not show any change in either group during the remainder of the study. Furthermore, the concoctional administration of F plus T appears to reduce the impact of testing on Prostatic size and Posterior hypertrophy."
29159857,"In this paper, we examine the effects of methylphini date on children with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. We find that it is more effective than placebo in improving social behavior in children who have a range of pervasive developmental disorders. A double blinded, placebo-control study of Methmylphenidate in 33 children aged 5 to 13 years showed significant improvements in social communication, self-regulfment, and response to joint attention exercises when compared with standard treatment. The results are further supported by an extended analysis of the use of different dosages of mh in patients with mental retardations or borderline intelligence. Most sideeffects occur with brisk doses; however, there are no significant side effects for any particular condition. Children with ADHD show little improvement in their performance on tests of reaction time. However, they do show some positive effects on other measures such as parent-rated scores on tasks. This suggests that Mh may be useful in treating children suffering from ""pervasively developmental disorder"" or ""intellectual disability."""
30903209,"In this paper, we examine the effects of diets high in animal-derived oligose on bone mineral denition. We conclude that there is no significant association between soy and isolavone use on forearm injury among women with low dietary intake. However, our study does not reveal any association to other risk factors such as age, weight, estrogen use, tobacco use or exercise. The effect of these two different types of food on bones is unknown. Our aim is to determine whether an increase in vegetables and a lower amount of animal protein can reduce bone loss in late postmanopausalsal women. This results in fewer bone changes after three months of treatment."
30521577,"In this article, we describe a new method of reporting patient-reporting outcomes in controlled trials. The aim of the trial is to compare treatment with conventional restorative methods in primary teeth. This study will compare the long-term survival of conventional treatments with that of Art in posterior primary tooth. It will be performed in school setting. A trained examiner will conduct the treatment after 1 week, then 1 6, 12 and 24 months post treatment. There are no significant differences between respect of material or methods employed. One year results show that Art and the hat technique were successful, proving its use forprimary dentitionin areas with high Caries prevalence. Two-arm parallel group, patient/r and OMized controlled trial will have treated provided in schools. After one month, they assess the pain intensity among children treated with the ""Atraumatic Restoration"" approach. Children reported more pain at follow up than those who received the conventional restorations. They also showed more negative behavior in the art-based approach when appoximal dentol lesions were managed by three treatment strategies: conventional restores, hall technique, and non repomer caries treatment; P = 0.051. Conclusions The art-base approach to managingEcc resulted in comparable levels of dental anxiousness to the St and Ard treatment approach, which provides valuable alternative approaches to management of EcC in 'primal dental care setting'."
24476510,"The effects of testosterone in older veterans with mobility limitations are investigated. A multi-faceted stroke rehabilitation intervention results in improved physical function and disability among older men with limited movement. In addition, the use of exercise to improve health is associated with increased suspense intervals, which may lead to greater recovery. Older women who attend more than 50 % of prescribed resistance exercises have better changes in maximum strength measures versus less adherented women. This study also focuses on the effect of lifestyle intervention on balance and strength performance in elderly people with functional limitations. Although there is little evidence supporting this association, several studies have suggested that exercise can be an effective treatment for older adults with moderate to severe pain."

24726015,"In this study, we report on the effects of cannanbinol on pain and sleep in patients with a multiple sclerical condition. We found no significant side effects from any of the treatment groups but that there were some dose-related sideeffects. This was the first study ever to suggest that sleep behavior is related to drug use. The aim of this paper was to investigate whether an orally-administered medicine could be used as an anti-spasticant for multiple disease states. It was found that it improved spasticity by reducing the severity of each patient's symptoms. A second study examined the efficaciousness of medicinal extracts in treating multiple diseases. Although these studies did not have major safety concerns, they reported that their results were positive. They also reported improvements in quality of life after four weeks of treatment. These studies showed that cannizamil had fewer adverse effects than placebo. However, other drugs such as morphine and gabaparentin failed to provide any additional benefit. Furthermore, insomnia was associated with increased risk of alcoholism among young adults."
29560832,"In this study, we examine the association between dietary habits and hip fracture risk in a cohort of European women aged 35-64 years. The results suggest that increasing calcium from diet may not lead to significant cardiovascular benefits, but it does seem to be important for maintaining bone mass during early adulthood. We also find that consumption of dairy products has been associated with reduced risk of fractures in older adults. Consuming dairy product increases bone mineral content in young girls who are physically active."
26927924,"In this paper, we present the results of a study using the Survey of Aging and Longituality in Europe to develop an instrument for measuring ""filty"" in older people. The test was performed on 100 Polish patients aged 68 years old who had been at home for one year or more. They were divided into three groups: 1) frail subjects with no known mortality status; 2) pre-Frail subjects without known deaths; and 3) frails with known mortalities. We conclude that the test is valid and repeatable as it has been used in other countries. A comparison between the simple sof-index and the complex Chesida-Henry's score shows no differences in the prediction of falls, disability, fracture, and death among different risk groups. Frailties are associated with increased risks of death, but they are not significantly related to long-term health outcomes. Furthermore, there is little evidence of association between physical well-being and mental health."
29026933,"This study focuses on the validity and reliability of the Persian version, the Foot and ankle Outcome score, as used in patients with different feet or ankle problems. It is a validated measure that can be used to assess patient's health-related features. The results of this study suggest that the Turkish version of Fausia Score may be more accurate than the American Osteoartis Score because of its greater frequency of errors. In addition, it has been reported that there are many other foot-specific measures that have been developed for use in these studies. These include the Ankle Oarthritis Score, which was first published in 1890, and the FFi-3pt, an activity-restrictive measure designed to measure the function of walking."
17636648,"In this large, double-blind, randomed study, we examine the efficacy of four different treatment arms: 1) ascorbicacide at daily dose; 2) placebo; 3) with additives; and 4) without an adder. We conclude that there is no significant difference in the duration or severity of cold episodes between the four groups. However, the clinically usefulness of these results does not extend to the well-fed adult. A controlled trial was made of ascotbic acid supplements, natural orange juice, and placebo over the prevention of common cold. There was also a 14-25 % reduction for total symptoms due solely tothe common winter in both groups."" Just as importantly, our results show that IVAC produces higher concentrations of vitamin C than can be obtained with either oral or IVD administration."
28676426,"In this paper, we describe a new approach to evaluating the significance of change in health-regarding quality of life questions by comparing their scores to ""global ratings of changes."" This approach is especially useful for determining whether patients are getting better or worse after treatment. We present results from 32 randozed controlled trials with chronic diseases. The mean difference between the two groups is about 0.29 points and corresponds to the moderately important difference in questionnaire scores. A future study needs to be performed to determine whether physicians can accurately predict the importance of the small difference when calculating sample size."
32230939,"A worksite intervention has been found to improve many of the risk-factors associated with cardiovascular disease in patients who have undergone a long-term lifestyle change. In addition, there are no significant differences between time for Sbp, Hba1c, or Ldl-C. However, short- term results favor the phone group over the long run. This study is an attempt to determine whether exercise and nutrition counseling can be effective in reducing blood pressure and body weight in overweight men. The results of this study suggest that low-intentioned lifestyle counseling may be more effective than other forms of health promotion in improving both physical and glyceric risk factors."
25933128,"In this study, we examine the effects of behavior therapy on weight loss in overweight patients. We find that self-control is more effective than external control in promoting long-term reduction of weight. Although initial weight losses are positively related to weight lose at 30 months, it does not predict short or long term weight Loss and psychological well being are examined at thirty months in men and 62 women initially treated by behavior treatment as a functions of ""a / initial weigh loss and"" weight-losses goals. Forty smoking and 47 overweight people were recruited for either smoking Cessation or fat loss. All three treatments produced significant changes over an eight-month intervention; however, participants returned weight after 24 weeks without any distinction. The results showed that all four approaches produced substantial changes in health habits equal to the change experienced by subjects in the'st and Ard group program'. This suggests that low-priced programs may be useful for disease prevention."
19360230,"Carnitine is a good dietary intervention for patients with severe obesity. The effect on the lipoproteins and atherogenation of low-disease lipometry in racialized women is described. In this study, green tea extract increases the size of the LDL particles by increasing the proportion of subfractions that are smaller than those found in the placebo group. This suggests that it may have some fat oxidative powers. However, there is no significant change in body weight or energy expenditure between the two groups. A further study investigates the effects of chlorinated water on appetite and weight loss in obese children. There is little difference in either group's blood lipid levels or in their response to food."
25317988,"The Swedish Trial In Old Patients with hypertension is a prospective, doubleblind, intervention study designed to compare the effect of active anti-hypertensesive therapy on the frequency and risk of fatal and unfatal strokes and myo Cardiol infa Rct Ion or other cardiovascular death. Three hundred 7ty patients were registry eligible for this study. All people with suspected acute stroke either from an acute attack of the head or from ischemic disease were registered prospectively and assessment was done according to steriadic criteria. This study intends to determine the relative and relative risks that recurrent Stroke over the first five years after 'first-ever stroke' would be 22.5 p..95 % confidence limit ; 16.8 %), 28.1 percent. After followup, 12 reavers were observed in diuretics, beta blockers, or both groups. Mortality was reduced by 30.216. 6 vs. 16 mm. Blood pressure fellby 30.5/16.6, SD 18.5 /10.1 m.

19588353,"The aim of this study is to determine the best blood pressure treatment for patients with Type 2 diabetes. Specifically, it is decided that patients should be given three different goals: a low-dose acetarylsalicilic acid, ASA / aspirin 75mg; and combination therapy. This will involve two major issues: 1) what is the most appropriate target diatolic blood demand during antihypensive treatment regarding the reduction in Cardiomorbidity and Mortality? 2) How does the patient respond to these different levels of hypertension? In order to answer this question, patients will be divided into three groups: ""advised"" or ""omized"" to one of two goals -- either an intensified or moderately-controlled regimen. These subjects are assigned to either intensity or moderation of blood flow control. They are also assigned their mean blood force at follow-up. After evaluating the effect of both levels on blood forces, the results indicate that the more intense group has fewer risk of stroke and death than the less vigorous group."
26207053,"In patients with Type 1 diabetes, glyciaemic control is associated with an increased risk of hypocemia. This treatment involves continuous observation and assessment of the patient's condition over several weeks. The results are similar to those obtained in the first two studies. After six weeks, both groups experience greater frequency of severe hypocrisy. Both groups also experience more frequent autonomic or nocturnally-induced episodes. A further study investigates whether blood glucose awarenesstraining can improve the ability of subjects to recognize and respond to hypogliescaemia when compared to conventional therapy. Although this intervention does not lead to improved mmolol/dL levels, it does lead toward improved quality of life and reduced severity of symptoms."
23482592,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed description of the age-regular changes in men from different European countries. They include patients with ossa who have had bariatic surgery but do not show any significant change in their weight loss. The results are similar to those reported in other studies. For example, when blood sugar is calculated by HIMA instead of insulin or glucose, it also shows an association with overall mortality. This study was designed to examine the impact of diet and exercise on sexual function among overweight subjects. There was neither intervention in either group. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups. A further study examined the effect of weightloss on erectility function in obese males. It showed that both body mass and free testosterone were important predictors for predicting high-dental lipoprotein levels. Furthermore, these results suggest that lifestyle changes may reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes."
14583958,"In this study, we examine the relationship between smoking and health-related quality of life among patients who have undergone thrombolytic surgery. We find that quitters have improved their health after one year in comparison to those who are not smoking. The results suggest that stopping smoking can  Halve the risks of dying from myocardiaal infaculation or anginapectoris as well as psychosocial factors. A large prospective study of middle aged men is performed using resting electrographs, a chest pain questionnaire, and recall about 'angina or of previous heart attack'. Men with no evidence of Ischaemic Heart Disease were divided into three groups: 1) No evidence; 2) Evidence short of definite Myo Cardiol Infa Rct Ion; and 3) Prognostic Effects of Plasma fibrinogen, Plasma viscotsity, White Blood cell count, haematological Variables were significantly associated With all-caus mortality over the follow-up periods. After two years, however, there was no significant difference in survival for both groups. This suggests that smoking may be largely responsible for the risk of death following an acutemyodal aborted angiogram. However, it is also important to note that many other risk factors -- such as blood pressure, body mass index, etc. -- remain unrecognized. Most importantly, smoking has been shown to increase the chance of sudden death by increasing the frequency of these events."
26356689,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of undernutrition on older patients after fractures. He shows that there is no significant difference in body weight change between women with and without nutritional support. The results are similar for both groups: one patient dies in each group; another patient survives only in the hypothecia group. Both groups have different blood loss and energy expenditure during their surgery. Acute venousthromboisis is more frequent in patients with malignancy than in those free from malignant disease. Laparoscopic or open bowel surgery reduces short-term complications but does not improve long- term outcome. Postoperative fluid loading has also been shown to decrease postoperative pain and recovery. Shorter stay in hospital is associated with longer preoperative gastricempting time and shorter duration of hospital stay. This study compares the effect of fast track anesthesia on wound healing as well as laparoscopic surgical techniques. It concludes that rapid follow-up care may be beneficial in high risk patients who undergo colonic rsection."
28827256,"The results of a two-week intervention in adult patients with poorly controld Type 2 diabetes show significant improvements in their health. A1c levels are significantly lower after the intervention, and there is some evidence that this intervention may be more effective than other treatments. In addition, the patient's well-being scores seem to improve over time. For example, one European trial found that people who received standardized treatment for Type 1 had better self-behavaor than those who were not. This study furthermore examined the effects of family-based approaches on improving blood glucose control among African American adults without type 2 disease. It was concluded that these approaches could lead to improved quality of life, weight loss, behavior change, or both."
30666617,"The results of this study suggest that a pro-biotic intervention can be used to delay or prevent the onset of Type 2 and Type 3Dids, as well as improve the health of patients with these diseases. Probiotics have also been shown to improve blood levels of triglycerin, cholestane, and total cholesterol in healthy subjects. In addition, they have been found to increase butyrate concentrations by reducing the amount of short chain fatty acids that are present in the gut. This is important because it may lead to improved absorption of fat from the body. Furthermore, the probiotic treatment has been reported to reduce the risk of developing Type 1 and type 2 diabetes."
26187342,"In this study, we examine the effects that a combination of levodomepral and halopridol has on the overconfidence in error after single dose administration in healthy subjects. There are no significant effects on draw to decision or probability threshold to decisions. Motor learning is improved by biperide and rivaspimine while visuosespatial functions are impaired by aspirin. The effect of substigine pre-treatment for cortisole awakening and desmopressed patients is also examined. Antiglucotocorticoids do not have an adverse effect on neuropsychological function; however, their use can lead to fatigue, distress, concentration decrements, burnout, or symptoms of mental depression. Overgeneral Autobiographical Memory has become well established phenomena within Major Depressive disorder. We hypotherprise that in contrast with healthy controls subjects acute Cortisone administration would not alter autobiographic memory performance in major depressive disease. Methods Thirty healthy men were randomed into three groups: one group was given levocacine, another was treated with placebo. Brain scans were performed at two different time intervals during which rats were trained on artificial vocabulary using repetitive approaches. A Val158Met Polymorphism showed that individuals with genotypes other than Val/Val declined in executive functions over the five year period. This study compares sleepiness with delayed recall in young healthy adults."
30426004,"In this single-blind, rand-omized study, we examine the effect of two g/ day NAC on bipolar disorder. The results are positive for both groups, with significant reductions in anxiety symptoms and depression severity. Both groups also show improved dopamine binding to the caudate at week 16; however, there is no significant change in the placebo group's mean increase in DAT binding. This suggests that neuronal dysfunction may play a key role in treating mood disturbances."
22071801,"The narrator describes the results of a doubleblind trial in which patients were given either clostazol, or placebo for six months. After this initial treatment, blood pressure was significantly reduced and there was an improvement in the quality of walking distance. In addition, both groups showed significant reductions in pain free walking time. Both groups also showed improvements in their recovery time after three months of treatment. A further study has been carried out on 160 patients with arterial disease who received either aspirine or clodipogrel. These patients had no change in any of the other parameters measured by the ankle-arm test. This is important because it indicates that these patients are at risk of stroke or death from peripheral artery disease."
23609774,"In this paper, the results of a doubleblind, randol-controlled trial are presented. The results suggest that improvement in mental and motor performance is ""catches up"" in terms of brain development over the treatment period. A further study is performed in which children who have severe iondeficiency are given either 475 millig/L or 164mg eodine to improve their health. Brain function is improved after four months of treatment. Children born with severe deficitiencies are more likely to be affected by neurologic dysfunction than children from controls."
27761306,"The probiotic group has a lower rate of colonization in the gastrointestinal tract than the control group, and this is due to an improvement in gut motility. In addition, four confirmed cases of Necrotising Enterocolitis or sepis were found in both groups. Probiotics have been used for the preventive treatment of necrotating enterocotis because of their beneficial effects on intestinal function. This study was conducted at five neonatal intensities in Turkey. It was concluded that Lactobacilus casei may reduce the risk of developing Nec-stage 2 by Bell's criteria in very low weight infants. However, it did not lead to any significant differences in feeding intoleration or length of hospitalization among the three different groups; there were no significant changes in birth weight, treatment with antimicrobials and the start time of breastfeeding. A further study examined whether Bifdobactericia reduced the frequency of nosocompiliaal infections in preterm babies. No significant difference in incidence density of infection between the two camps. Furthermore, the use of BBG-0001 does not seem effective in preventing late-onset disease in prematurely born infant girls."
28531197,"This study demonstrates that a six-month lifestyle intervention program can prevent or delay Type 2 diabetes in adults with impaired glucose resistance. In the intervention group, weight reduction is greater than that of the control group and this difference is sustained in the subsequent year of follow up. The aim of this study is to examine reach, implementation, andefficacy of sanity-distracted lifestyle change for adults at low risk of type two diabetes. A pilot trial was conducted in 1993 and results were reported in June of 1998. It showed that an intense diet exercise program could reduce the risk by 58 per 100 person years from high-risk individuals to 31 per cent with metformine compared with another drug. After three months of daily contact with participants, the main outcome include changes in body weight, physical activity,and dietary changes; fat, Saturated fat and fiber intake. Attenuates the association somewhat as well as lower third: moderate-To-vigorously lentatonic / relative risk 0.5.95 % chivalric vs strenuous structured ltatonia '. We carriedout post hocanalyses on the roles of leisure time activities and smoking in preventing disease in 487 people and women who had impaired glutonic tolerance who completed 12 month LTPA Question naires. These results suggest that lifestyle changes may be more effective than other approaches because they are not dependent on patient involvement. However, there is still uncertainty regarding the importance of walking and light exercise. There are 107 new patients of Type 2, which remains after the individual Lifestyle Intervention was stopped. Meta-analysis suggests that physicians prefer ""patient dominant"" rather than ""shared"" versus ""no patient involved"" treatment decisions. Physicians who prefer no patient participation in decision- making are more likely to get blood tests while those who favor ""more physician-directed style"" receive more risk factor testing."
27036879,"This first-person, population-based study focuses on the prevalence of musculonoskeletal pain in Lebanese women and their health seeking behavior. The results indicate that telerehavior is superior to conventional outpatient treatment for patients with a total hip arthrectomy. In this paper, we describe an attempt to assess the efficacy of two different methods of assessment: the use of the ""science method"" and the traditional approach of faceto-face assessment. We conclude that these two approaches are highly suited to answering many surgical questions."

28854877,"This paper focuses on the use of conditional cash transfers in Mexico to improve maternal and child health outcomes. It shows that pregnant women receive nutrition supplements, health care, and acceptance of cash transfer payments. The program is associated with improved birth weight outcomes for low- income, rural women from Mexico. In addition, it has been found that there are at least nine percent points of new HF use among poor women participating in the program. More evidence suggests that more cost-effective supply-and dem and side financing programs could inform future strategy. A significant scale-upof maternal health voucher schemes that focus on institution delivery will bring India closer to its goal for institutional delivery. Women who received the voucher booklets in 2009 were more likely than those who had sold them in 2008. Pregnancy surveys were conducted in stratified samples of women who have been pregnant in this study period. There was no clear impact of the change in maternal care provided by the intervention on ANC, PNC, or hospital delivery; however, logistic regression was used to determine whether an increase in facility-based services was greater among poverty-stricken women relative to nonpoor women in control union council's compared with the control councils."
24978932,"This is a small, descriptive laboratory study designed to examine the relationship between the two test scores and an ANOVA. The results of this study are as follows: there was acceptable agreement among pairs for four out of seven conduct questions in the tested group; there were no significant differences in tests scores from the control group. In addition, the American Academy's ""Cerebral palsy and developmental medicine"" method has been used to conduct systematic reviews since its publication in 1875. There is little difference in fall rates between trained and untrained groups. However, there is some improvement in gait speed when fatigued hip movers are engaged. Gaittraining involves walking at brisk speeds while supporting cradles for safety. Fatigue leads to greater increases in stability Faktoren than fatigue of ankle muscles. After six weeks, these subjects were divided into three groups: water-exercise group, non-water-exertion group and control/control group respectively. These studies have not yet been published. They do not involve expensive equipment or professional assistance. To date, no trial has investigated the effect of falls prevention exercise on balance ability in older adults. Thus, it is necessary to further investigate whether such exercises can be effective."
19808490,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the features of right ventricular Dysplasia. In patients with complete right-ventricular basking, an rfbb ratio of 1 is sufficient to detect arrhythmic disease. When compared to controls with RBBBs of at least 0.5, the most specific and sensitive parameter is an inversion through IV4, which shows excellent sensitivity and exactness. This study was a multi-centre, open-labeled, phase IIa study of 100 patients who had mild to moderate risks of stroke. After ablation for acute fibrillation, no significant differences were found between groups. Acutely active typhoid fever induces dissatisfaction with chronic orthostatic hypertension. Postural Tachycardia Syndrome reduces the risk of heart failure by reducing the severity of the symptoms. Early ICD therapy has been shown to be effective in preventing fatal events in patients without thrombosis."
17488967,"A prospective observational study is designed to assess the burden of adverse drugs in the general population. The results suggest that front-loaded aspirin with weight- adjusted heparn over APSA without hparin in treatment of acute coronary disease. In this trial, patients taking low doses had lower in hospital mortality than those who took st or ard-dose aspidin. There were 12,25 admissions from an ADR and most reactions were either totally or perhaps avoidable. This study was followed by a comparison of the benefits and risk of adding cristol to different dosages of aspriin when treating patients with acute heart attack. For example, the adjusted relative risk for major bleeding was 1.9 for 300mg of Aspiriin, 1.6 for placebo group, and 1.17 for combined group. From 1979 until 1985 2435 people having transient is Chaemic attacks were rand and ommly assigned to receive either daily or asprin 300 milliliters per day or placebo. After these studies, no significant reduction in likelihood of either Disabling Major Stroke or Vascular Death occurring occurred. Therefore, we combined all the serious events and deaths"" into one control group and joined the Anti-Implified Steerforth/ASA 300 mg group to make an anti-ischemic stroke group.""

31645057,"In this paper, we examine the effects of a preterm infant's diet on morbidity, growth, and length of parenterally nutrition. The results are similar to those of other premature infants: birth weight is 983 g vs 27.5 wk in the bovine-milk-based premeal formula group; gestational time is 27. 7 m. d. After comparing the duration of parental nutrition days with that of conventionally fed babies, it is concluded that feeding exclusively breast milk or donor milk may be more effective in preventing infection than feeding solely human milk. A study was conducted at five neonatal intensities in Turkey to investigate the safety and efficacy for probiotics as well as enteral supplementation in premature newborns. It was found that both groups had lower rates of Necrotizing Enterocolitis and surgical intervention when compared to an exclusively human dairy-derived diet. For example, the control group received only Bifidocilus Lactoferrein, which reduced the risk of necrotising enterocotis by up to 1.9 mm/day. However, there were no significant differences in blood or line infection among the two groups. This study concludes that ""lactulose appears to be safe"" and does not cause any serious disease."
29633142,"The primary goal of this study is to determine whether pain and activity are more responsive in patients with Ostearthritis than pain alone. A measure of pain intensity, the Pain Intensity Numerical Rating scale, is used as a measure for pain severity. This results in an improvement in pain scores from pre-to-postgripping when compared to those obtained by other measures. Furthermore, there is no significant difference between the Physician's Outcome Measurement Questionnaire and the Patient Represented Outside Complications Score on knee pain patients. Thus, these studies aim to assess the reliability and validity of four patient-report outcome measures: 1) Anxiety; 2) Depression; 3) Pain Interference/Physical Function Static Short forms; and 4) Pregnatal Injection."
28391233,This paper focuses on the relationship between physical activity and risk factors in older adults. It examines the association between sitting time and death in a Canadian sample of 17-year-olds. The results suggest that people who spend more time sitting are at greater risk of premature mortality than those who do not spend as much time doing physical activities.
22851269,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the activity and safety of gemcitabin monochemotherapie in elderly patients who have advanced bladdercancer. A complete response was obtained at a rate of 35.5 % for an overall responder rate, 24.3 - 65.7 p.m. In addition, older patients were more likely than younger patients to be frail or fall-risked. This study also uses the Geriatric Questionnaire as another reference tool for prediction of falls among older adults with malignancy. Although there are no significant differences in mortality between adult and child-aged patients, it is believed that geriatrimetric assessment can aid in decision making regarding treatment."
16061898,"The Time-Tradeoff test is used to measure the quality of life in different health states. It is based on three principles: 1) subjects give up time in order to improve their health; 2) they live for longer than expected; and 3) they use proportional measures to determine how long it will take them to live. These results are inconsistent with the assumptions made in the literature about what constitutes ""time-tradeoff"" and how it can be applied to different types of patients."
20459782,"This paper describes an exercise intervention for older women to improve their physical and mental function. The results are quite different from those seen in other studies. In this study, the walking group showed better health than the control group; however, both groups improved significantly in terms of self-re reported sleep, mental status, health concerns, and general health scores. A neighborhood walk program was established with a multi-level design that included five hundred eighty two senior residents who were 65 years of old or older. They were asked to participate in daily walking activities as well as weekly health education workshops. Their performance on these measures was very similar to that of controls. Six year predictions of successful age were examined for 357 Alamedan County Study people and women aged 55 and over: income above the quintile, odds ratio, cross sectional comparisons At follow-up reveal significantly higher community involved, physical activity,and mental health forThose aging successfully. Physical activity seems to be associated with reduced risk of dementia in older men. However, there is no association between physical strength and disease severity. There is also little difference in the effect of vigorous exercise on gait, balance, fitness, fall risk, etc. Although some studies have suggested that physical exercises may help preserve brain function, others have failed to show any significant relationship between them."
19433422,"The purpose of the present study is to describe the symptoms and severity of players who have been injured with sprains during the previous season. A concustion is defined as a blow to the head caused by an impact on the skull. Post-concurssion symptoms are measured in terms of severity and duration. In contrast, patients suffering from multiple previous injuries report worse symptoms than those not experiencing any injury. This study suggests that either number of post-consulsive symptoms or their duration may help predict future recovery."
22117033,"A long-term prospective follow-up is required to determine whether the degree of atrial ecstasy predicts the success of ablation and whether it can be improved by improving sinus rhythm. The results of this study indicate that treatment with an electric current may be more successful in reducing recurrent acute fistbite than with antiarrhythmically-drug use. In patients with persistent or chronic ailment, however, there is no difference in heart rate variability between the immediate after-effects of PVI and those without PIV. However, sub-plots suggest that additional electrodes for amniotic therapy may improve the outcome of these procedures."
27591931,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective, observational study of patients with castrated-resistant prostatecancer who received enzalutemide. The overall survival rate was 18.4, and there was no difference in the two- and five-year BCR free survival rates. A significant association between patient's post-sct micturition severity and the length of their iceball count was found. This study is designed to validate the use of cryotomies as an effective treatment for men with advanced or metastatic disease. It also reports that changes in therapy after elevenCcholine PET scan were implemented in70 of the 150 male patients. Purposive 11CCHOLINE PET/CT showed positive results in 109 prostatutes; 72.7 percent of these patients had local relapsing. Progression-free survival was significantly reduced after the crossover of leuproline to degaresciln group. Adverse event occurred frequently during the trial period. Men with newly diagnosed, metaspecified, hormone-responsive prostate cancer received either luteinzing Hormone-releasing Hortensin Analogue or an anti androgen agent. After seven months, men treated with docetaxil had hazard proportions for death of 1.20 and 0.91 respectively. When given with prodnison, both groups improved survival. Salvage radiation was associated with increased survival among men without metastases. Urgent salvage surgery was more likely to be curative than immediate or regimented hormonal therapy. Orchictomization was not recommended because it did not lead to long-term morbidity. However, several studies have suggested that continued orchiectomy might be better tolerater than conventional surgical treatment. These studies are registered with the National Cancer Council."
23499244,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective observational study on patients receiving acute electroconvulsionsive therapy for first-onset schizophrenia. We conclude that it is safe and efficacious in young adults who have been treated with conventional treatment. Acute ECT improves the quality of life as well as those of patients with initial disease. This suggests that there may be an advantage in using ecstasy rather than drug or morphine in treating patients suffering from severe mental illness."
29168225,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of an ""aqueous Noble cultivar rootsstock extract"" of kavan in anxiety. Forty volunteers undergo bilateral extraction of third morals in r and Omized, double- blinded crossover trial. A total number of 52 subjects were under chronic stress; either Ashwag or ha root extract was used as an anti-anxiety agent. No serious adverse reactions were reported during the treatment period on Day 15, Day 30, and Day 45. In addition, no significant change in the State Anxiness Inventory Score obtained just before spine anesthesia was observed. This study further investigates the efficaciousness of Passiflaria incarnatus Linneaus for improving anxiety, psychomotor function, sleep latency, and fatigue severity in patients who had been scheduled for surgery. It was found that skullcap improved night sleep quality but did not improve daytime symptoms. Further studies are needed regarding the use of medicinal plants such as passion flower and naturopathic agents like morphine and pentylenitetrasole to treat anxiety"
31336032,"In this paper, we show that dissociation of the domain of memory also applies to order memory. We use a game called ""Virtual Week"" to examine the effects of delayed intentions on prospect-i-ve memory in adults with autistic spectrum disorder. The results suggest that people with ASD have less accurate time-based and event-retrieval performance than controls."
25005924,"In this paper, we describe a method for predicting the likelihood of health workers adopting an alternative approach to controlling MiP in Ashanti region of Ghana. We examine the influence of different patient characteristics on patients' decision-making and conclude that there are differences in preferences among surgeons, midwives, and physicians. This study is designed to assess the ability of doctors to resist changes in treatment approaches by comparing their willingness to pay with those of other medical practitioners. The results suggest that they may be less likely to accept new treatments than lower-ranking nurses. A survey was used to identify patient preference for various aspects of GIST medicine. It was found that patients preferred reducing severity rather than improving severity from moderate or mild. Preference questions were sent to 1000 individuals who each made three or four discrete choices about hypothetical tests that varied in seven attributes: how testing is offered, process sensitivity, rate of excessive colonoscopies; expected mortality reduction, method of test result transmission,and cost. These results indicate that more expensive PMPs should be reserved for patients with the least severe pain and less intense pain. Physicians across the world rank efficacy higher than sideeffect risk because of the long-lived effects of drugs. They also rank side effect risk aboveefficacy in importance due to the fact that many countries have developed disease-specific drug regimens which include cheap talk. Although these studies do not directly relate to DCE experiments, they provide important information regarding the relative value of multiple design characteristics as well as several recommendations for improving reporting of such experiments."
24683002,"Warfarin and aspirin are both safe and effective for preventing strokes in patients with severe heart failure. In addition, they are associated with reduced risk of death from major bleeding. This study determines the best antithromboctic agent for patients who have moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction. It is concluded that warfari is more effective than either drug in reducing the severity of their disease. There is also a significant increase in New York's Heart Association classification when compared with placebo. A double blinded study was performed to evaluate the influence on the angiotesin-converting Enalaprile treatment on prognosies of severe congetive heart failing. The primary objective were death, no fatal myomyocardial Ion /or nonfatal Stroke. Antithrobolic therapy in these patients has not been studied before. However, this work suggests that there may be some relationship between use of blood-thinning agents and survival of patients suffering from acute or sub-acute chest pain."
19270759,"In this paper, we examine the effects of memory and inhibition on children and adults using a battery-powered device. We find that young children are better able to manipulate their memories in steady state than adults; however, adult versions of these tasks do not seem to be as effective as younger children. A similar effect is seen in children with polymorphic alleles of the tryphophan hydroxylase 2 gene. The results suggest that an association between the two genes may be due to serotoninergic dysfunction. Children with both types of ADHD show reduced reaction times when they are given cued target locations. This suggests that some kind of anchorage for attention is maintained by the right brainisphere."
24206044,"This paper summarizes the most recent evidence on the effects of black tea, green tea extract, and other dietary approaches on risk of Type 2 diabetes. It does not find any significant differences between the two groups in any measure. However, there are some slight reductions in body weight, waist circumference, HbA1c level, insulin levels, as well as a significant rise in the level to ghrein. More studies need to be performed to determine the best dose of consumption for fasting, postpran and ieal thermogenesis. In particular, more studies must be used to define the effect of different types of food on blood pressure, energy expenditure, skin aging, etc."
24772264,"This study focuses on the effect of two different methods on sealant retention. First, we examine the results of three different techniques for enamel preparation prior to sealing: 1) using air-Abrasion method; 2) using acid etcheding technique; and 3) using self-curve resin-based sealedants. The results show that all three methods have a significant reduction in the risk of caries developing into dentine than does the other two methods. In permanent teeth, Delton Plus shows fewer pits and no fissure formations after 24 months. A multi- level logistic regression analysis is used to calculate the effects of confounding factor and clustering factors. Children with at least one permanent tooth with signs of an early cary are recruited. They are divided into three groups: 1, 2, 3, and 5 years old. After 12 months, 485 patients were examined. At 3, 6, 6 and 12 month intervals, the retention rate was 93.3 percent. Caries preventive and antibacteria effects were studied by Fisher exact, chi square and ANOVA test. Sixteen subjects age 16 and 17 year were included in this study. Retention rates were notsignificantly different for either technique at 6 months or 12months. However, they were significantly higher in group 2: air etching followed by acid cleaning. These results suggest that the use of these two sealants may be more effective in reducing carousal growth than it is in treating children with conventional sealers."
25632374,"In this study, we examine the effects of omi-suppressive diets on body composition and weight loss in overweight women. The results suggest that a high-dose of vitamin D may be beneficial for weight management. We also report that there is no significant change in blood pressure or lipoprotein levels when compared to control groups. A double blinded placebo-controlled trial was conducted to assess the effect of daily calcium and vitaminD on serum 25hh diastity and highdensity fat mass in subjects with low waist circumference. This study confirms previous studies that caloric supplementation can have an advantageous effect on weight Loss."
16286432,"In this study, we examine the effects of work-related coping on patients with relapsed rheuuma toid arthritis. The results suggest that there is a significant reduction in the cost of care for patients who have regained their health after receiving treatment with inflizimab and mtx. We conclude that these patients are at high risk of losing their job because of their severe RA disease. After completing 105 weeks of therapy, in addition to an additional dose of MTX, they show marked improvements in physical function, quality of life, and signs and symptoms. This paper describes the history of patients suffering from ravages of histological disease from the time of diagnosis until 1985. Forty seven individuals started working before the onset but only one third had stopped working within the first year of illness. A detailed interview was performed about lifetime work condition and work disability amongst all patients; however, it was not possible to predict work loss by patient characteristics or by age."
14583987,"In this study, the effect of feeding infants with milk other than cow's milk on their gastrointestinal transit times is examined. The results indicate that breast-fed children have a lower risk of developing asthma or earache than those who are not breast fed. Atopic disease occurs in the first two years of life but does not result from the intervention. After adjusted for confounding factors, it is concluded that early exposure to dairy products before 4 months has an advantageous effect on asthma and opportuneness because it reduces the risks of both diseases. This suggests that there may be some advantage in having babies with asthma at least four months of age. However, these studies do not reveal any significant differences in food allergy or allergic reactions between the groups. Asthmatic disease is more common in low-society groups than in higher social economic groups; therefore, public health intervention should promote an increased length of exclusive breastfeeding may help to decrease the morbidities and prevalence of child asthma. Preventive measures such as regular breast feeding and avoidance of foods during pregnancy and Lactation are recommended. Although no difference in family history scores or IgG levels were found, they did not significantly differ in severity of symptoms. Allergies are most frequently associated with cow ""milk"" consumption. There is little evidence regarding the association between diet and sensitation in preprimanded newborns."
26605535,"In this study, we examine the effect of a custom fit knee brace or foot orthotic on improving the moment of the knee during gait. The results show that the reduction in the external knee Adduction Moment is greatest when the two devices are used simultaneously. When the device is first used, the Achilles tend to be pained and the ankles are not as stiff. After an accommodation period, all subjects return to the lab for gaits. Twenty patients with moderate to severe knee Ostearthritis have reported problems with using wedge amounts greater than 7 degrees. This study aims to determine whether laterally wedgeped insoles can reduce the peak knee Adduction moment. It was found that after one month wear, there was no difference in biomechanical effects for obesity, stage of disease, and weight. Conclusions were made regarding the efficacy of these new devices."
26746590,"Ten healthy volunteers were recruited to participate in a prospective study of the effects of three different forms of drug use on brain function. The first experiment was based on repeated measures of hippocampals and showed that subjects with continued or reduced use of morphine during the follow up period were more likely to continue using it than those who stopped their use after the first trial. This study also examined the association between the left parahaippocampal amygdasala and subsequent use, as well as the risk of developing an overdose of this substance. In both groups, the baseline volumes are significantly negatively impacted by stimulant use throughout the following 12 and 24 month period. A multiple regression analysis suggests that there may be some evidence of compound-specific associations between these levels of volume and the subsequent uses of drugs. Both groups show significant differences in the severity of symptoms measured by the Cognitive Dissipation Questionnaire. Short-term and Long-Term Effects of Emstasy Use On mood and its associated with 5-H neurotoxicity, dose, and gender among humans. These results suggest sustained effects upon brain microvasulature, white matter maturity and possibly apothecary damage due to lower dosages"
19821273,"The primary outcome of this study was total stroke within 180 days. In the treatment group, patients received clodipogrel as well as aspirin with a lower risk of fatal bleeding than in the control group. This trial was stopped because of an increase in statin use. We investigate the effects of various anti-platelet agents on platelet Aggregation Ration using Wu and Holter method. Each treatment consisted of-25 patients with acute myomyotic stroke. Platelet aggregateability was measured on the first day before treatment, 10,th and90th days; comparisons were significant but differences between treatments were not significant. On the second day, differences of par between aspidin and control are significant, but difference between the other groups were neither significant nor significant: indicating 'a lesser antiagrigregant efficiacy' of aspriin We compare warfarin to aspin for the preventive effect of recurring bleeding from wounds in highrisk patients. Warfarn was associated with less nonfatal Stroke than asspiin or Clopidogrovel. Acute heart failure has been debated since the time of the American Heart Association. For example, it is recommended that ticloplinid be used after stented lesions. After successful stent placement, 700 patients were assigned to receive either 500mg TTlopirride or 75mG tclid in addition to100m Aspirine. These studies raise concerns about the practice of substituteting cotidogral for triclopidine after chest surgery. Further studies have been carried out regarding the safety of both regimens. Two trials based on different doses of drug were compared against one another in patients who had severe coronary disease. They showed similar results in terms of major bleeding. Major bleeding occurred in 2.4 percent of patients receiving ""prasugrul"" and in 1.1.8 %of patients taking cloplid. There were also no changes in blood count during these two trials. Another double blinded multi-centre trial comparing the benefits of combination therapy with low-dose arachidic acid was performed. It found that there were no apparent adverse events at base line. However, laboratory reports revealed lack of platelets inhibition in 5 to 40 %) of all treated patients"
24088547,"In this paper, we describe the effect of a one-year idine intervention on mental and motor performance in schoolchildren who were severely deficient. The results suggest that an improvement in blood tyranny is associated with improved mental performance. A double blind, omicide-controlled trial was performed in Australia to determine whether mildly ill pregnant women with mild or moderate  Iodines could be cured of pregnancy-induced goiter. This study concludes that long-term use of salt during pregnancy can prevent maternal hypothormonism and improve mental development in both mothers and newborns. It also suggests that short-lived consumption of high-iodinated salt may reduce the risk for maternal thyroid failure."
19843330,"Acute Cand Esartan Therapy in Stroke Survivors The aim of the present study is to assess whether angiotenisin type 1 receptor blockades can be used as a preventative measure against stroke in patients with moderately high blood pressure. In this study, over five hundred patients were divided into two groups: one group was treated with aspirin and the other with esstadan cilextil. After six months, 12 %) of each group experienced an acute ischemic brain injury; at six month's time, cumulative incidence of event was significantly lower than in the only group. One patient died of re-current stroke. This study compares perindopriml with amlopidine for secondary prevention. It shows that combination therapy with peridopril or indapacamide produces larger blood concentration reductions and greater risk reduction than does single drug treatment with penicillin alone."
31611064,"In this study, the effects of long term zinc supplementation are compared to those of st or ard therapy in patients who have recurrent chronic hepatiscencephalopathy. The results suggest that short-term zinc treatment may be more effective than a single regimen of either drug group. HepatitisC patients receive three years of zinc replacement therapy and their blood levels improve significantly. A doubleblind, placebo-control trial is performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of low-dose zinc as an alternative to steroid therapy for patients with alcoholic liver disease."
23913029,"The association between overweight and school performance is investigated in this first study. It was found that girls who become overweight at the beginning of their school years are more likely to be able to improve their academic performance than those who remain overweight. This study uses a multiple-regression model to examine the relationship between weight loss and changes in school behavior between the time of entry and the end of third-grade. Brain activity related to response inhibiting and competition were observed bilaterally, in the doorsolatéral prefrontal coronation, parstriangularis regions of the inferior Frontal Correspondence, premotorcortinia, inferior paritetal  Lobule, lingual gau date, as well"
22405279,"This paper describes the results of a telephone interview survey in which 1278 people were asked about stroke risk factors, warning signs, and treatment. The results suggest that an integrated stroke care program may reduce the risk of future strokes and increase the speed of patient presentation after the first occurrence of stroke. In addition, it suggests that education can be used to prevent or delay recurrence of acute stroke as well as to improve the quality of care for patients who have received such services. It is reported that smoking cessations are now accepted as part of many health care systems and that there are major research efforts under way to improving current success rates. Nirz, Zolorogorska Z, sugarman H ; Structured nursing aid versus routine recovery after stroke: Although there were not significant differences between these two groups at entrance to study, at three and six mos after Stroke, the intervention was more successful than the regiment with better scores on functional status, depression, self-efficacy, weight loss, satisfaction, mood, etc. After stroke, almost half survived 5 years. Of survivors, one third still remain disabled and 1 in seven are in permanent institution care."
24700446,"In this paper, we describe the early failure rate of patients who undergo a metal-onmetal hip replacement. The outcome is similar to that of conventional total hip surgery. After three years, there is no significant difference in the patient's functional outcome. A comparison between pertinent pre and postoperative details relative to totalhip resurfacing or total knee arthrography would assist in understanding current perceptions about outcome; however, it should be cautioned against using too much blood loss and transfusions as predictors of outcomes. We conclude that the best outcome for patients with OsteoArthritis is improved after two years of total surgical intervention. This study also describes the results of an open-coaxing prospective cohort of 245 patients from 1996 to 2005. It was found that both groups had better function than their reference group. However, they did not show any differences in bone mineral denition at follow-up. For example, when cemented and uncemented hips were replaced, the prevalence of fractures was reduced. When the Elite Plus system was introduced, these results were even more promising. Although the risk of revision was significantly higher than those performed by other hospitals, such as Lund, surgeons reported good results."
25899581,"In this study, we examine the association between famoral-glutial apologies and Type 1 diabetes in adults with and without retinopause. We find that patients with Type1 have lower blood levels of glucosine and greater fat mass than those with type 2 or Type 1, but no association is found for other risk factors."
30456865,"In this study, we investigate the effect of sour-teared tea on blood pressure in healthy men. We find that compared to control group, there is no significant difference in the mean levels of serum highdensity Lipoproteincholestrol in green tea or sedentary tea groups. Conclusive Brain Snack: Cardiovascular disease is a category of metabolic disorders that affect heart and blood vessel function. Most of the studies have been published in western countries without different lifestyles, including the Middle East. The present study shows that consumption of white rice has not been associated with any risk of cardiovascular disease among Iranian men; however, whole grain consumption does not seem to be an effective strategy for preventing these diseases. This study also finds that drinking orange juice can improve blood lipid concentrations in patients with moderately hypercholestererolemia. It was found that both drugs were well tolerated. A further study compares the efficaciousness of Pycnicol in treating acute venousinsuffiency. Both showed improved circumference of lower legs after two and four weeks of treatment. After 8 weeks, they had no dropouts. PykcnogenOl significantly reduced endothelusial function in subjects with Type 2 diabetes. Fasting Plasma glucose declined by 27.7mg/dL as vs 7.5.7mb in controls group. There was no change in urinaryalbumin level at week 8, but neither did changes in other risk factors. These results suggest that it may be beneficial for patients suffering from mildly severe hypertensives."
31954418,"Children with ADHD have a significant reduction in the size of their cortex. They are divided into two groups: those with symptoms and those without. The results suggest that intense physical activity can improve attention in children with or without ADHD. In this study, we examine the association between exercise and executive functions in Spanish children. After six weeks of treatment, the mean right frontal brain lobe is increased in both groups. We conclude that vigorous exercise might be effective as an adjuvant for improving the effects of medication. Acute-physical activity has been reported to improve several aspects of executive function in patients with mild-to-moderate hyperactivity."
18775062,"Walking for Well Being in the West: A Pedometer-based Walking program. In this paper, we examine the efficacy of walking with physical activity as an intervention for older adults with Type 2 Diabetes. The results suggest that walking can be used as a preventative measure against type 2 disease and improve quality of life in older people. We also report that there is no significant difference in blood pressure between the control group and the intervention group. This study furthermore describes the effect of short bout walk on mood states in elderly patients with osteoarthritis."
27994451,"Tiotropium improved lung function and patient-reported outcome in patients with gold stage II. The results of this study suggest that the addition of exercise training to improve physical activity may be an effective strategy for improving quality of life after an exclusion from treatment. A further study is described in this paper, which reports on the use of self-management as a preventative measure against diseased lungs. This trial was designed to determine whether or not nocturnally nipv therapy can improve health-related qualities of live, functional status, and gas exchange in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It showed no significant differences between groups at the time of initial intervention. However, it did show improvements in daytime blood carbon dioxide pressure and step count. Another study was performed to investigate whether home-base pulmonary rehabilitation could deliver equal benefits to center-based regimens in cost effective manner. In this case, the program consisted of one home visit per week followed by 7 weekly telephone calls. Both groups were found to have similar characteristics at baseline. An exercise-specific behavior-change self management program was used to increase physical active activity in subjects with moderate to severely chronic Obstructive Pulmonatory disease; however, there were no difference in daily walking time or time spent in either group. Furthermore, both groups had comparable features at base. These studies are important because they will help to define how best to treat patients suffering from severe obstruthive  pneumonia."
17194261,"In this paper, we describe the results of a randomised, double- blinded trial of imipramine in patients with severe depressive disorder. The mean reduction of Hamilton Depression Rating Scores was significantly larger than in the Fluvoxamine groups; mean difference =3.1, St and Ard Err error. This is an important finding because it suggests that there may be some type of resistance to treatment. Although clinicians often add another drug to an initial antidepressedant drug, no controlled trial has been conducted on this subject. A new approach called ""equipoise,"" which merges the advantage and avoids disadvantages of two different designs for clinical trials, is described. It is shown that although many patients are initially not responders to either regimen, they gradually improve over time. For example, one patient receives paroxenine immediately after switching from fluoxetine or sertraline but does not return to amiprominine. After six weeks of treatment, however, only 97 patients respond to both regimens. Another study compares efficacy by switching between bupropion and sertriline in major depression. Both treatments do not lead to significant changes in symptoms. However, their effects are similar when compared to those of other antidespressants. Some studies have suggested that using consensus guidelines or medications may improve outcome but cost more than single medication. There are also reports about discontinuation-earning adverse events upon ceasement of serotonein re uptake inhibitors such as dizziness, insomnia, nervousness and nausea. No single remedy is able to cure all depressed conditions. One strategy is to use multiple drugs instead of one at once. Other strategies include lithium augmentation and tricyclic Antidepressant/Reuptake Inhibition. These studies suggest that even though most patients fail to react to any given anticonvulsal agent, several can be successfully treated."
16539827,"This paper describes the results of a prospective, self-assessed health status measure in patients with severe rheUMATOID arthritis. It was found that the measure was sensitive to changes in pain, physical disability, psychological status, and pain. The outcome measures were physician and patient-global measures, but neither was highly responsive to tender joints count. Four pain scales -- 10cm visibly analog scale, 5-pointcategorical scale; Health Assessment Questionnaire, Artharitas Impact Measurements / Pain Score ; and 3 quality-of- life measures -- were compared. A single disease activity test was developed for patients who had classical RA. In this study, the Becky Disease Activity Index was used as an instrument for assessment of disease severity. However, it was poorly correlated with bone mass or other measures of inflammation. Thus, there was no need for further investigation into the use of such measures in clinical trials."
30019391,"In this paper, the authors describe a series of consecutive case-evaluations of an all-ceramic restourative system. The results are very good: for example, patients with no pain or secondary caries were able to get their teeth restored in just three years. A slight color mismatch was found between the two types of restorative systems; however, there was no sign of discoloration or persistent pain during the treatment period. This study also provides evidence that indirect crowns can be more successful than direct composites because they do not involve large fractures."
21827522,"In this paper, we examine the effects of a combination of self-efficacy and pain control measures on patients who have temporomandiodism. We find that patients with more pain sites, depressives, non-specific physical problems, reumination, and stress prior to treatment have higher activity interference than those with no treatment. This is due to differences in patient characteristics which predict or moderate pain response. For example, patients reported more painful sites before treatment had greater activity interruption at one year. The effect of CBT was not as strong as that of other treatments; however, it did improve for some patients. A group of ninety- four patients were assigned either an ""biofeedback"" treatment group, another group consisting of cognitive-behavioural skills training, or 'no-treatment control groups'. These patients showed significant improvement in their pain scores during the three-month follow-up interval. Finally, the purpose of this trial was to determine how pity can be used to assess whether any minimal intervention followed by dentist TMD treatment improved the usual clinical treatment after 3 months."
23269815,"In this study, we examine the effects of multivitains on blood concentrations and function in older people. We find that folic-acid and B12 are more effective than placebo in preventing hyperhomoclasemia; however, there is no significant change in blood levels of other vitamins or mineral values. A doubleblind blind trial was conducted with 189 elderly subjects aged 50-85 years. The results showed that consumption of fortification reduced the proportion of persons with marginal serum Vitamin B-12 concentration from eight % at enrolling to 0 percent after 12 weeks. This trial also demonstrated that ""breadfortified"" with sufficient amounts of floric acid and/or vitamin B 12, improved folate and VDL status and increased phosphorus content. No significant changes were observed in either serum homocystee concentration or bone turnover during the intervention period. Furthermore, these results suggest that higher homocephaline concentration may be a potential risk factor for fractures in Older men and women."
26914664,"The effects of sitting for extended periods of time on postpran and iac metabolism are examined in this study. After two days, the levels of agreement between sitting and walking break up significantly. In contrast, sitting interrupted by light or moderate intensity physical activities reduces blood sugar but does not lead to significant changes in energy expenditure. This is an important finding because it suggests that children may be better able to predict weight gain after one year of vigorous activity than after only moderate-intentional physical activity."
28752947,"In this study, we examine the effects of a combination of strength, balance, agility, and jumping training on older adults. The results suggest that exercise can be used to postpone age-related problems in older people. We conclude that resistance, endurance, or balance training are more effective than other forms of exercise for improving physical function in elderly patients."
9755013,"Neck pain is a common cause of neck pain in the U.S., and many patients respond quickly to either physical or ometic treatment. A recent study suggests that using pulsed electric currents can be an effective treatment for neck symptoms. In this paper, we report on the efficacy of electroacupuncture and physiotherapy in treating neck-pain. Both methods produce significant improvements in pain scores over three months. The results indicate that both methods are effective in relieving neck discomfort. Thirtying up all thirty patients with acute neck painfulness, they are divided into three groups: group A receives active electrodes; group B receive facsimiliate placebo electrode devices. After two weeks, there is no significant improvement in their pain score. However, some patients have improved significantly after several weeks of therapy. Another study investigates the effect of manipulating the neck muscles in patients suffering from neck injuries. This study concludes that ""manipulation"" is superior to other forms of treatment because it produces immediate relief of pain and restores muscle function."
19457497,"A tidbit of information: Stroke is the most common cause of strokes in the U.S., and there are no medical treatments available to treat it. In this paper, we report on the effects of amphetantamine on motor recovery after a stroke. After two weeks of treatment, patients recover significantly faster than those treated with placebo. The results of this study suggest that an extended period of physical therapy may be necessary for improving motor function after acute stroke"
22786497,"In this paper, the results of a double blind trial are presented. The patients who receive memantine or citalopram are more likely to be depressed than those who take sertraline. This suggests that both drugs may be useful in treating major depression. A large number of trials have been funded by for profit organizations; however, most of these trials do not report funding. Although there is no significant difference in side effects between the two treatment groups, it is clear that they are similar in terms of age and severity. There is also some evidence that serotonnin re uptake inhibitors can improve motor performance in dejected patients. These studies suggest that several different antidepressive agents might be better tolerated in patients with Major Depressive disorder. However, many reports indicate that certain patients experience diminished ability to cry, irritation, care over others' feelings, sadness, eryotic dreaming, creativity, surprise, anger, expression of emotions, worry about things or situations, sexual pleasure, and interest into sex. Thus, we conclude that either drug group is effective in relieving minor depression as well as improving mental health."
27306431,"In this study, we examine the association between physical activity at a young age and body mass index in black girls. We conclude that there is primarily skepticism about these associations because of the lack of reference values to cardiovascular risk factors for African-Americans. This study also uses accelerometry to assess blood pressure among 421 Latin American high school students. The results suggest that vigorous exercise may be associated with increased health-related quality of life. A cross-sectioned study of 441 black and white High School students was conducted from September to May. Although no statistically significant differences were found between the search methods, it was possible to use three different searches on each arm. These studies did not show any significant difference in the relevancy or accuracy of their results. However, several factors could have influenced the results: genetics, nutrition, type of exercises or sport,hormones and skeleton age. Therefore, many other factors had been taken into account as contributing to the finding. Thus, all of these factors are likely to be important predictors of disease."
28615218,"In this study, we investigate the association between physical exercise and back pain in healthy adults. We find that men with moderate-to-low-body weights are at a lower risk of developing lowback pain than those with less-than-average physical function. This suggests that there may be some role for physical activity in preventing future episodes of low Back Pain."
28371813,"In this paper, the cost of a fall prevention program for older women is compared to that of an exercise program. The results indicate that the program is more cost effective than other falls prevention approaches. Cost savings are also seen in terms of improved health status and quality adjusted life years. A comparison of two different resistance training regimens is made. Both are more likely to prevent falls than one another. Although there is little evidence of cost-efficacy in the use of these newer approaches, it is clear that they are not as effective as those used in other types of falls intervention."
28614164,"The functional movement screen, or FMS, is used to predict in-season injuries among adelescent male pace bowlers. A significant difference in the scores between injured and non-injuring bowler groups suggests that the score may not be useful for prediction of injury in young females. Three physiologists use observational risk assessment to rate 40 girls about their knee injury. Injured players are more likely to suffer an injury than other types of sports. Athletic performance tests, such as the Star Excurssion balance test, are used by college athletic officials to identify those at greatest risk for ankle and low back injuries."
17164942,"In this study, we report the results of a double blinded placebo-controlled trial in which patients were given either olazapine as an antipsychotic or sertraline. Both groups showed significant improvements in their PTSD symptoms.

They use hypnotism to predict changes in bone mineral content after six months of consumption. The results suggest that increased phosphorus-loaded diets may be associated with reduced risk of fracture for women who consume more than 95g per day. This is not surprising because it has been reported that young women have an increased risk and are therefore less likely to fall prey to fracture. However, these studies do not reveal any association between long-term or short-lived increases in nutrient supply. We examine whether the effect of high-protein meals on bone mass is related to age, sexe, energy, weight, estrogen use, tobacco use; exercise, total caloric intake, and total fat/fat ratio. These studies provide evidence that fruit and vegetables can increase bone health in older women. Although there is no relationship between anthropometric measures of bone size and food composition, we conclude that ""fruit"" does not seem to affect bone metabolism."
28330835,"This is a controlled trial. The intervention group includes 28 patients with heart failing who receive daily home-based communication and follow the program for one year. After this period, there is no significant difference in readmissions or quality of life among the two groups. A further study was performed on 1437 patients from October 12 th, 2011 to September 30 '13 that were hospitalized for Heart failure. In this study, we compare the effect of combined health coach telephone calls and phone-monitoring does not reduce 180 day readmouts. We conclude that widespread deployment of distant technologies can improve the care of patients suffering from heart failure by reducing their costs and increasing their ability to self-manage. Our aim is to determine whether home tidbits such as remote medical care can be used to prevent death from all cause or readmitted within 180 days. It is shown that both groups have significantly improved patient compliance and satisfaction during the first three months after the intervention."
27629776,"Milrinone is a good choice for patients with severe heart failure because it is associated with reduced left ejection-fractions. It also reduces the risk of stroke, which is particularly important in patients who have congestive hearts. Antithrombolic therapy is not evidence-based but frequently contributes to Polypharmacy studies. The primary objective of this trial was to determine whether antithrombotics are associated by reduction in the rate of sudden death from all causes and whether other factor such as age, treatment with anticoagulant agents, or captoppril affect longer-term ratesof stroke. In addition, there were several reports that acute myoretic ischemia caused by coronary disease was critical in curing sudden cardiac death. This study furthermore examined the relationship between angiotensol-converting agent and survival and Morbidity among patients suffering from moderate to severe Left Ventricular Systolic Dysipation. Although no relation was found between the severity of the disease and the incidence of fatal events, we conclude that these events are most likely due to the interaction between patient characteristics and their use of antiplatelet agents."
27591453,"In this study, a double blinded rand omised clinical trial was conducted in 46 bipolar subjects with manic episode. The patients were treated with either topiramates or bupropion salts for six weeks and were assessed by young mania Rating Scores weekly. Both groups showed marked reductions in depressive symptoms from baseline to final assessment. However, the differences between the two groups were not significant. Conclusions These preliminary open observation of adjuvant topriamate treatment suggests that it might have anti-manic or an anticycling effect in certain patients with biphosphorus disorder; and may be associate with appetite suppressing and weight loss"
29042383,"Acute coronary events are a major cause of death in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Although there is some evidence that lifestyle changes can improve the risk of heart disease, no studies have examined the effects on these conditions. In this paper, we describe an advanced-practice nurse-centered approach to discharge planning for older patients at risk for readmissions. The study results in improved health and reduced patient admissions as well as improvements in quality of life after six months. We also examine the effect of short-term self-management exercises on blood glucose control in type 2 patients. This intervention does not result in improvement in Hb1c but only increases it by improving physical work capacity."
26733622,"In this study, we compare the efficaciousness of a single-aggressive regimen with cyplatin plus gemcitabinib in advanced nonsmall-celllung lung cancer. The results are similar to those reported for other treatments: overall response, progression free survival, Os, tolerance quality of life, and QoL. We also report that erylotinibe is superior to docetaxell as an initial therapy for advanced small cell lung tumors. A pilot study was conducted in which patients with advanced or newly diseased lungcancer were treated with pembriliazumab or carbopicillin. Although no significant differences were found between the two groups, they showed tolerability. Both regimens had longer median survival than either group; however, there were some serious adverse events. These included anaemia, fatigue, skin rash, pain, nausea, cough, etc."
26769120,"In this paper, the first results of a pilot study are presented. The intervention group uses an attachment-based approach to improve patients' quality of life by reducing their mean level of depressive symptoms and improving their time with significant manic symptoms. This trial is intended to advance knowledge of the use of cell phones in bipolar treatment. It has been shown that using these devices reduces depressed and manicular symptoms as well as increases the duration of illness. A second phase of studies will be performed on the effects of ""Mood Swings Plus"" and ""Cognitive Behavioral Therapy"" for people newly diagnoseed with Bipolar disorder."
26219990,"The results of this study suggest that a six-month exercise program improves peak oxygen up take and other measures of fitness, physical activity, lung function, and qualityof life in patients with Cystic Fisis. In addition, the patients receive less time to perform physical activities when compared to expected values. A prospective observational study is performed on twenty-four patients aged 12 to 40 years with cysic disease. Osteoporosity is common in adults with severe disease but may be due to corticosteroid use. This study consists of two groups: an intervention group consisting of an anorobic training program for 6 months; and control group composed of controls who do not change their daily activities. Both groups show significant relationships between their activity results as predicted by the Hasses, diary or accelerometer."
26443336,"Dairy-products are associated with an increased risk of prostatecancer, but no significant increase in total dairy products is seen. Yogurtal consumption is also associated to a reduced risk for type 2 Type 2 diabetes. In this study, we examine the effect of low fat yogurt on blood lipid profiles as well as on growth and body composition among schoolchildren in Bangladesh. We conclude that these results suggest that there may be some association between dairy consumption and incidence of overweight or obesity."
31432431,"Eight healthy older and seven younger men were enrolled in this study. They received anoen energetically-induced isoinducation of lipids and glucose for 180 min on separate day. Their concentrations of CCK, Glp-1, and Pyloric Motic were measured. The results suggest that human aging may be associated with increased levels of the secretory cholineculin, which may lead to reduced appetite and food consumption. In addition, these changes are related to increases in blood trigllycerides, suggesting that a daily dose of 20 mg of peg-ob might have biological effects on obese men."
24370846,"In this study, we examine the effects of a high fat, high-glucotse diet on body weight and blood chemistry in healthy men and women. The results suggest that consumption of high amounts of sugar may lead to an increase in both fasting and sensitivity to insulin. We also investigate the effect of low-glyceric and fructosic foods on lipid and glucose balances. A cross-over design was used to assess the influence of two different types of food on various bodily functions. For example, subjects were fed either their usual diet with 1000 kilocal extra glucose daily or they were treated with added 500 mmol/day of sucrose. Both groups showed significant changes in basal concentrations of glutinous and pancreatic secretions. These changes were not found in any of the other three groups. Furthermore, no strong changes occurred for liver fat as well as subcutaneous abdominalfat."
31076817,"The effect of a daily regimen of 15mg of vitamin K on bone loss in older patients with chronic disease is reported. In the first three months, blood levels increase significantly in the treatment arm but do not affect other measures of bone quality or function. A double blind, randomed placebo-controlled study was conducted wherein 10 patients received 15 milliliters of Vitamin K1 per day and another 10 were given 15 mg of vitamins K2 every day. After six months there was no change in bone mass or mineral density. This study examined the effects of two different forms of therapy: one that consisted of either phosphorus or alkaline polyphosphates; the other consisting of an additional form of vitamine K2, which included menatetreone. It was found that both groups improved their bone mineral density at the same time. Both groups had significant changes in their BMD after 12 months. They also showed increased bone turnover markers. These results suggest that they may be useful for improving bone health in elderly women."
31805963,"Is it possible to use prebiotics along with a lifestyle intervention to improve the gut flora in obese women? In this study, we examine the effect of an eight-week diet on blood glucose concentrations and markers of Type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that probiotic andprebiotic supplementation together can be effective at reducing both fasting and iodinated blood glucose levels. We conclude that these studies confirm that substitutes for glycycaemic sweeteners may be an advantageous strategy to reduce postpranal blood sugar response to foods. This trial is designed to assess the effects of short chain fructooligonsaccharidas on insulin resistance and antioxidant status among patients with Type 1 or Type 2, respectively. It was found that long chain inulin had pronounced antihypertenic effects on all three major risk factors of type 2 disease."
28436684,"The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of a combination of methadone and saw palmosin on serum prostate-specific antigen levels in patients with benign prostatichyperplasia. In this study, efficacy was found for both treatments. For example, after six months of treatment, the change in total IPss score was significantly reduced when compared to the control group. This suggests that an extract of serenoa may be more effective in treating chronic benign prostitutes."
27089322,"The primary efficiacy outcome measure was the change in the Panic and Generalized Anxiety Score. In this study, patients with infrequent or mild-to-moderate panic attacks were followed for 8 weeks. They improved their scores on the Patient's Survey of Sensing and Suspecting Measures, the Ham-A, HamD, and the Cgi-21 AnXiety score. However, they did not show any significant improvement in either the severity of symptoms or the frequency of attacks. A further study was performed to determine whether there is a relationship between anxiety and panic disorder. This study found that patients who had recurrent panic disorders reported more severe side effects than those who did never have panic problems."
29947999,"The aim of the present study is to determine whether a single session of spa therapy can be used as an effective treatment for knee osteoarthritis. Forty patients with knee OsteoArtritis are included in this study. They are divided into four groups, each group consisting of 24 patients. Each group receives two weeks of physical exercise and one week of ""sulphurous baths."" A significant improvement is observed in pain scores, functional capacity, quality-of- life, use of pain medicine, and severity at any visit. In addition, both groups improve their patient's well-being by reducing consumption of anti-inflammatory drugs. This effect is confirmed by the reduction of drug consumption."
17054240,"In this study, we examine the effects of vagal maneuvering on the antegrade limb and retrograde pathway of tatchycardia. We compare the effect of these maneuvers on PSVT and comparisons between the patients in the control group with 30 age-matched subjects. Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachy Cardioa: Valsalva Mocking was shown to be superior to placebo in terms of lengthening SVT cycle time, AH intervalsion, and block cycle duration. The results of this trial indicate that ditiazing is safe and efficacious in treating acute episodes of paraoxysmal convulsions."
26203172,"This paper reports the results of a large, random, and cross-sectional trial involving 8338 pre-school centers in India. In this study, there is strong evidence for an effect of wearing gloves during school days to prevent wormbits from infecting children. However, no specific cause of deaths was significantly affected."
26387860,"This paper describes the use of a needle to stimulate the upper trapezus muscle in patients with myofacial pain. It is shown that there is little information about the mechanism and biochemistry associated with persistent pain, although it is known that this can be caused by soft palpation. The results of this study indicate that 52 women develop myoscia pain syndrome after breast surgery. A year later, 116 women have not been given any information regarding myorascial disease or other symptoms. Post-surgery follow-up studies show significant increases in PTTseg at 3 and 5 ptsi respectively. These results suggest that dry needle therapy may lead to segmental antinomiceptive changes in the muscles. In addition, these findings are related to motor neglect in complex regional pain disorder. Prosero has been established as an international registry of systematic reviews on health-related conditions."
28053857,"Nineteen patients after stroke were matched with 19 people without impairment. This study uses the Wake-My-Fumiometer Score to assess motor function in adult patients who have had a stroke. The results suggest that bihemisprising tdcs and physical and occupational treatment improve upper limb function for up to 5 months. In this study, we examine the effects of intensity of EMG-ess on arm function after acute stroke as compared to control subjects. A cluster approach is used to predict whether or not an improved recovery will be obtained at six months' time. Thirty five patients with stroke are included in this trial. They show improvement in their arm functions when ibsleep is combined with transcranial Magnetic Stimulation."
31869370,This is a prospective observational study of 10 135 women with atrial fibrillation. The results suggest that treatment and intervention may be more effective in improving quality of life than does current treatment.
27120555,"This study aims to explore the effects of an education-based intervention on depression and diabetes related outcomes in patients who are mild to moderately depressed. Although there is no significant difference in depressive severity at six or 12 month follow-up, this does not affect the treatment effect. A nine point categorical classification system was developed for missing outcome reporting bias and its impact upon cochrane reviews. The results showed that more than half of all trials included only one outcome variable. In addition, some studies had been excluded from the review because they did not include the original recording outcome variables. For example, when a patient's symptoms were described as total, negative, and general, their change in knowledge was greater in those with higher levels of complexity. Type 1 and Type 2 patients were assigned to an ""integrated care intervention"" or usual care. When these patients received better adherence to hypoglycmics and antidespressant medication, they were larger in both groups. Depressed patients could be effectively treated by Cognitive Behavior therapy. However, certain specific issues that relate to trials of other medicines do not specifically address in the Consolrment statement. These concerns are addressed in another paper. Depression can also be effective with behavior therapy; however, it is difficult to apply the same principles to non-pharmacological treatments."
27418186,"In this study, we examine the association between consumption of sugarsweetened beverages and increased risk of Type 2 diabetes in healthy men. Consumption is also associated with increased risks of stroke and other complications. We re-examine the effects of sweetened drinks on blood glucose, insulin, leptenin, and trigllyceride levels."
27820504,"In this study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an adolescent antipsychotic in patients with acute or exacerbedation of schizophrenia. The mean duration of stay was 33.4 days. Progressive and significant improvements were observed on all BPrs scores and Cgi-severity of willness scores from the first weeks through discharge. Clozapin is an effective treatment for severe ill patients who have failed adequately to respond adequately to sterile drug treatment. This study focuses on two groups of patients: patients treated with olazpine and those not treated by other drugs. Both groups report positive attitudes toward medication and improved quality of life. A change in patient's attitude toward medicine was associated with improved conformity. These factors were also related to improved compliance. All cases are classified using reliable diagnoses and all were follow up for two months. Sociomedific factors and illnessvariables were unrelated; therefore, these factors could be used as predictors of compliance during the initial visit. After two years, most common side effects included fatigue, sleep difficulties, and headache. Polymorphism was not involved in treatmentadherence. However, it was evident that some aspects of insight and attitude were important towards improving well-being after admission. Some aspect of confidence regarding their ability to take care of themselves was noted. For example, patients believed that they had been helped at the time of admission and agreed to accept treatment after discharge but did not admit any more than once. Other characteristics such as fear of sideeffects or satisfaction with medication were reported. Brain Snack: Many studies suggest that there may be psychological basis for poor understanding of psychosis."
23832767,"In this study, we examine the effect of written information on patients' recall of risk during rhinoscopy. We find that those who receive more detailed risk-information have greater increases in anxiety than those with simple information. A pamphlet is also used to improve patient satisfaction and knowledge about the risks involved in surgery. This paper discusses the use of an endodb for improving patient knowledge before surgical procedures. It shows that patients are better informed when they receive both types of information; however, there is no difference in satisfaction between the groups. Furthermore, it does not affect the cost of the procedure either. The main outcome measures patients ""knowledge"" regarding the legal implications of writing consent and their opinions on the function or remitof the consent form."
25985324,"The results of a six-week weight loss program are reported in this paper. After bariatry surgery, the patients lose significant amounts of their body mass and gain improved blood levels of lipoproteins, cholesterol, and other important circulating factors. In addition, these changes are associated with increased gluco regulation and reduced inflammation. This study is an attempt to confirm the association between Mediterranean-style diets and higher concentrations of high-adiogenes. It was found that men and women who adhered to 'Middle Eastern' style diet had lower body masses and waist circumferential heights than those who were more moderately obese. Furthermore, it was revealed that there was little evidence for the relationship between low-Addiecane concentration on lipid profile and elevated phosphorus content. Aiming to determine whether lifestyle intervention can improve insulinsensitivity, we examined the effects of exercise alone or by combined diet and exercise as well as two different types of fat loss. Both groups showed marked reductions in lelptin, hippopotamin, basal glyceride, free acylcholic acid, tumor necroseis factor- alpha, interleuvinin 6, IL-6, TNF/alpha; and recombinant absorption of arachidon."
25818951,"This study focuses on the effects of a family-based lifestyle intervention on Chinese American girls. The results suggest that greater levels of emotional support from family are associated with improved adherence to long-term sodium restrictions for African American daughters as compared by boys. Caffeine increases blood pressure in healthy men and women but does not lead to any significant changes in weight or body mass. A diet based on fruits, vegetables, and low fat dairy products is shown to be effective in preventing hypertension in overweight and young adults."
24357818,"In this study, we report the results of a two-year observation on periodontal changes. In group I, only minor changes are seen; in group II and III, however, there is an increase in periodotal bleeding."
26853814,"The results of the present study suggest that ""dha is the principal fatty acid"" in fish and oil that is responsiblefor their BP reduction and blood pressure reduction effects in humans. This study investigates the effect of black seame meal, which has been used as an anti-hypertenic treatment for patients with mild pre hypertension. It showed significant decreases in systelic bpm and MDA levels after four weeks of treatment. Sesamimin, one of several lignins contained in sesamin had been considered to be medicinal effects. In this study, twenty-five middle aged subjects were divided into 2 groups matched by body mass index. Pre-clinical studies suggested that it was believed that consumption of white or black oils could induce beneficial changes on risk factors related toward cardiovascular disease. After two months, no significant changes were seen in endoteliaal function. A further study was performed to investigate the efficacy of vitamin E overdose on 24-hour artery blood flow. Results showed that the dose of coconut oil significantly reduced both total cholesterol and low denisity lipophosphorylation. Furthermore, there were no major changes in other anthropometric measures such as weight or BMI after eating."
26675773,"Pregnancy and weight gain are strongly associated with pregnancy complications, but no evidence of psychological well being is found. In addition, pre-pregnant overweight and excessive food consumption are the strongest predictories of excessive gestationsal weight gains. A fetus origins theory suggests that term babies who are small to their gestationally age have increased susceptability to chronic disease as a result of physiological adaptations to overnutrition during early pregnancy. The effects on body fat loss in men with Type 2 diabetes were examined by double-experimentation. Fat loss was significantly greater in women with high levels of saturated fat than in those with low levels. Women with higher amounts of added sugar were also more likely to lose weight. This study uses sensitivity-spectrum analysis to examine the effect of only low-Glycemic Index on maternal blood glucose control and on infant and maternal's nutrition status. It finds that pregnant women tend to be more at risk of premature birth when they have excessively high GWG."
28985620,This study focuses on the effect of an eight-month treatment of patients with acute scarlet syphilis who have a severe form of the disease. The results suggest that this treatment may be effective in relieving the symptoms of these patients.
26306578,"The primary results of this study are that carvedill CR is more effective than placebo in relieving blood pressure and improving heart rate. A double blind, cross-over study was carried out on 24 patients with moderate to mild essential hypertension. In the treatment of these patients, all were better than either placebo or metorolol in reducing both blood flow and pulse rate after 6 weeks. All other active treatments were even more efficacious: Metoprololil and propramolal were more successful in controlling blood vessel function. Blood pressure measurements were taken before and after exercise. After three months, labetalaloe was found to have a significant effect on lipoproteins. This effect was particularly evident during exercise; no interaction was observed between the biochemical markers or in the side effects. Chlorthidone did not change at all with repeated administration. Labetalel was superior to five other beta blockers and thiazde diuretics in treating essentialhypertension as well as being cost-effective. Bendro fluazide had similar effects on resting and coughingblood pressure but was less effective when used alone. Both bendroflute and bedarflua Zide were equally effective at preventing blood vessels from regaining their normal range. Carvedalel reduced blood force by up to 40 mg per day. However, there was an increased resistance to typhoid absorption due to changes in posture. These changes resulted in improved renal artery resistance."
29206166,"Home exercise is shown to improve balance, functional mobility, and strength in stable hemilysis patients. This study compares the effects of six-month exercise training with home-based exercises or usual care for physical function and blood flow in hedolysis patient groups. The results suggest that this regimen may be useful in improving health and function among older adults who have a high risk of falls."
29139110,"In this study, we examine the effects that cash transfers have on girls' risk of contracting a serious disease in sub-saharan African countries. We find no evidence that these types of targeted intervention can reduce dolescension risks for boys but only for girls. The results suggest that there is not yet sufficient evidence to recommend using cash plus care as an effective strategy against HIV infection in Africa. This paper uses logistic regression to assess the effect of cash transfer on women's health and suggests that it may be more cost effective for women with higher education than their partners."
18254026,"In this paper, we describe the use of two different antihypertension drugs in treating patients with severe acute edememia. The first is felodipin, which has a good effect on blood pressure but does not cause any side effects. We also discuss the efficaciousness of both drugs for relieving hypertensively acute crises. Both drugs are safe and effective; however, they do have some drawbacks: they can induce irreversible changes in renal function or electrolytes. A double blind, placebo-control study comparing the effectiveness of nitedipine to nitroprsside in treatment of sudden crisis. Although both groups experience significant reductions in blood force after treatment, neither group achieves significant improvement in heart rate. Furthermore, both regimens fail to improve patient's symptoms."
28653427,"In this study, we examine the effect of adult male circumcision on early ejacuation time and the relationship between pre-existing epitheliosis and premature enjaculation. We find that after circumcising men for at least six months, there is no association with sexual dysfunction."
25267494,"This paper focuses on the relationship between physical exposures and low back pain. It uses logistic regression to predict the risk of injury for workers in two groups: group R1 with high work ability, and group B1 without heavy lifting. The results suggest that job rotation is associated with lower need for recovery than other measures of physical load. In addition, there is a significant association between mechanical load and LBP. A 1-year prospective study among refuse collecting workers was performed using stained and ardised question naire's. No significant results were obtained from this study. However, no significant result was found among those employed as refuse collectors or as drivers. An assessment of the Work Absorption Score was used to identify potential prosgnosic factors for successful working functioning in general working population. Workers aged 30-39 years had an average score of 0; however, workers older than 50 years old had higher scores. After three months of follow up, all construction workers who completed the Wai at baseline and reporting their work status were invited for preventive intervention. Conclusions There are some differences between the quality of these studies and those of other studies. For example, the Quality Index has high internal consistency but it does not have external validity."
26272731,"In this paper, we report the results of a large-scale, cross-sectional study of patients who received aspidin or prasusgrel for acute coronary disease. We found that there was no significant difference in bleeding severity between carriers and noncarrier groups. Major bleeding is associated with increased risk of death among major bleeding patients. The safety of antiplatelet treatment depends on the degree of platelet activity. Adenosinesine diphosphatate has been used as thromboprotective agent in many percutaneous intervention trials. However, it has not been shown to have any significant effect on bleeding."
15495002,"In this paper, we examine the effects of a double blinded trial of two identical twins on cold symptoms. The results show that one member of each pair takes an equal amount of vitamin C daily and the other receives only matched placebos for 100 days. There is no significant effect in the shortening of colds by 19 p.m.; however, there is evidence that some vulnerable women benefit from taking large dosesof ascorbicacide. A double-blind study was conducted to evaluate the efficaciousness of ascobic acid taken over the first two days of the common winter. It found that the patients who received the treatment experienced less illness but were not associated with prophylactic disease. This suggests that it may be beneficial for children to take large amounts of alcibiades such as 1 g per day."
17467103,"Prevalence and characteristics of the fibromyasis were described in this paper. The mean age ranged from 18 to 60 years, with most patients between 60 and 80 years old. A total of 1,006 people had a moderately severe form of fagital pain. In addition, the severity of symptoms was similar in the community as well as the clinic population. Metametrisms determined that the presence of ""no pain,"" ""not widespread painful"" and widespread pain were more severe in both genders than in other groups. For example, among 3,006, no pain was present in Wichitsa, K. This study is an attempt to determine the prevalence of disease in general by comparing the frequency of pain at different stages of age. Results indicate that exercise is superior to stretching when compared to function, pain, depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Furthermore, pregabalin has been shown to be efficacious in treating Fibromyalscia Syndrome, which is characterized mostly by local pain but also includes widespread muskuloskeletal pain"
24524660,"This paper focuses on the use of health-related quality of life measures to predict survival in patients with breast cancer. The results indicate that a combination of antitumomab and etopoid therapy improves survival for patients who receive both treatment and follow-up care. A comparison of two different measures of well-being is made: the Dermatology-Specific Long-Form Quality of Life Questionnaire, which is highly correlated with clinical outcome, and the European Organization for Retrospective and Therapeutic Oncology Question-Question-C30, an instrument used to assess patient's health status. In this paper, we describe the effects of escorting patients through transanal wound repair on their health state. We also discuss the cost of treating patients suffering from psoliasis using hearing aids."
32259613,"The aim of this study is to compare the effect of a paleolithic ""Old Stone Age"" diet and 'a diabetes diet, as generally recommended for risk factors for heart disease in patients without treatment with insulin. This study was designed to examine changes in weight, waist circumference, serum phosphorus levels, blood pressure, haemologlobin, and areas beneath the curve for pulse glucose and plasma Insulin in the 75-goral glucose tolerance test. It was found that the low-GIdiet resulted in significantly reduced changes of serum Frogosamine Level, Plasma Glycated Haemogloin level, Serum Pulse Lipid Profile, Blood Pressure, Glycemic Score and Areas under the Curve for PlasmaGlucosine and PlasmaInspiration in Type 2 Diabetes not treated with Insulrection. In addition, the intervention group showed significant improvements in both body weight and abdominal circumference. Furthermore, it was observed that there were significant reductions on total fat, saturated fat or cholesterol. A worksite vegan diet increased increases in intake of protective nutrients, such as fiber, folate, vitamin C, magnesium and potassium, while decreases in total Fat, Saturated Fat andcholestrol levels. There was no significant change in HDL values at 3 months; however, after 8 weeks, participants were assigned to either control or the Dash eating pattern. Both groups showed improved results in terms of diatolic pressure and other measures of health status. Although both groups had significant improvement in Hb1c levels during the 12 weeks of the study, they were larger than the conventional group."
29381992,This study focuses on the relationship between the healthy and unhealthy weight trajectories. It examines the association between body mass and blood pressure in 2352 men and women aged 40-69 years. The results suggest that there is an increased risk of hypertension among these groups when compared to those who are not overweight.
17923128,"Estrogen therapy does not reduce the risk of heart attack in postmenophausal women. However, there is a slight increase in the amount of protein S that can be found in transdermal treatment. In addition, changes are seen in free-protin and prothrominogen levels. The aim here is to investigate whether transdereal estrogen therapy affects the endometrial function of post menopausally women with rheumatric disease. After six weeks of trans derective therapy, brachials were significantly reduced. This study was designed to examine the effect of either transdenel or placebo on the atherosculotic response of patients with acute coronary angiography. It was concluded that this intervention would have an advantageous effect on these patients because it could lead to improved blood pressure control."
32066446,"In this study, we report the results of a double blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial in which patients with tidbits of liver disease were given 800 mg reveratrol for 8 weeks. The results showed that there was no significant change in liver fat contents between the two groups; however, it did improve blood glucose levels. This is an important finding because it supports the notion that long-term consumption of large amounts of fat can lead to increased risk of heart attack. Furthermore, our study shows that rsveraterol does not significantly improve liver health in patients who are at risk for Type 2D."
28668150,"In this study, we compare the effects of two different treatment regimens on patients with a history of endogenosis. The first regimen is an eight-week regimen in which leurolide and norethrothisterone are used for pain relief; the second regimen involves six months of continuous use. This trial results in significant reductions in symptoms and changes in body mineral density. A comparison between dienogesterine and laparoscopic surgical intervention is made. Both groups have significantly reduced pain at the beginning of the treatment but there is no significant difference in severity or length of time to follow-up. We also examine the efficaciousness of add-back treatments for women with severe painful endometriostis who have relapsed from their previous treatment."
30377714,"The aim of the present study is to develop a patient-specific guide for total kneearthroplasty. In this paper, we describe the results of 40 patients who have undergone TKA between September 12, 2012 and January 13, 2013. We compare the conventional instrumentation with PSGs in terms of frontal tibiary component rotation. A significant difference was seen between the two methods: PSI improved the accuracy of aligning the prosthesis by using pre-operating marks that served as reference to set up the rotation both on the flemur and onthe torso. There were also more than three outliers among the different types of instruments; 15 %) in the PSS group and 8 % in those using conventional instruments. This study further investigates the use of patient specific cutting blocks to improve the precision of coronal alignment in total hip arthrostry. It was found that there were no differences in mechanical axes when comparing the control group to the experimental group. However, it was noted that some patients had greater malalignments due to slope of their bones relative to other patients treated with conventional tools. Furthermore, these patients received shorter surgical time and less blood loss after surgery. These patients did not suffer any complications during their follow-up period."
26231111,"This paper focuses on the early childhood habits of parents and children younger than two years old. It uses birth certificate records as a starting point, but it is not yet clear whether or not there is an actual relationship between these habits. Parents are more likely to encourage their children to watch more with them than they are to discourage children from doing so. The results of this study suggest that parental hopes for the education potential of television may be increased by encouraging parents who have already been watching with their young children. In addition, studies are needed to identify the association between physical activity and time spent watching TV. At six months, 1 year, and 2 Years, mothers reported how many hours their kids watched in elapsed time. We used multiplevariable regression analysis to predict the independently association of weekly viewing with strength and difficulities scores at three years of age. A total of 872 children were included in this trial."
26103637,"The results of this study suggest that the use of question-naires can be used to identify players at risk of injury. However, there is little evidence for a positive effect of these measures on injury risk. A total of fifty five injuries were reported from 505 players in the present study. In the first group, injury was identified by asking ""the sum of injuries"" and then by calculating the severity of each injury as compared to the expected injury rate. This result indicates that wearing the tape reduces injury risks significantly. After wearing it for 72 hours, no significant difference was found between the two groups. Furthermore, after using the taping for 24 hours no differences were identified among the groups"
23250273,"This study aims to examine the effect of walking or riding to school on physical activity in pre-primertal children. Children who walk or ride are more physically active and less likely to be overweight than children who go by bus or other means. The results suggest that reduction of screen time can reduce the risk of overweight among low-risk children, particularly those who have higher levels of daily physical activities. In this study, we examined the association between overweight and obesity as well as the health effects of different lifestyles. We found that overweight is associated with more ""computer usage"" and ""parent encouragement,"" while it is not associated either with weight or height change. To estimate how many overweight/obsessed children there are, an Australian population was selected using clustering of primary and middle school students from Denmark, Estonia, and Portugal. A cohort of student were measured four times during fall and spring at fourth grade. Students were divided into two groups: 1) regular active travelers and 2) nonactive travelers. They were assigned according to their age, sexe, location, compliance with pamphlet, etc."
29043392,"A novel primary care-based screening tool can be used to detect postmenopalisal women with fractures and increase proper management of Osteorosis. This study consists of two controlled trials: one in which patients receive usual care, the other where physicians send reminders for fracture treatment; and an observational study that assesses changes in behavior after six months of intervention. The results suggest that pharmacists are more capable of increasing bone mineral density testing among patients at higher risk of fracture. In addition, this study suggests that physician behavior may not be influenced by the results of the first trial. An eight-week exercise program is shown to improve balance, fear of fall, and health in older women who suffer from osteoporoseis or have a low bone mass."

At five-year follow-up, 38 p.m. preferring the Cobalt-Chromium knee over the oxidated Zirconium one, and 44 pp. have no preference for the other. A further study is performed to determine whether the use of an alumina-aluminum or metal-polyethylene prosthesis improves knee function in patients with osteoarthritis. In this study, all knees undergo total knee replacements with either cobbled or fabricated zircoium prostheseses. No major complications are observed; however, there are some minor ones."
31528342,"The aims of this study are to determine the predictors, moderators, and efficacy of short-term cognitive-behavior treatment for patients with binge eating disorder. In this paper, we examine the effect of overvaluation on outcome outcomes in three different treatment groups: CBT, bickering-eating therapy, or lifestyle intervention. We conclude that these treatments have potential for improving symptoms of eating disorders. For example, an inexpensive, easily dissed intervention has been shown to reduce onset of Eating Disorder among those at high risk."
18986755,"In a cross-over study, we examine whether adding programd intracanal PGE1 can improve the effect of sil denafil in patients with obstructive rectile dysfunction. All 40 patients were treated with either 50 or 100 milliliters of this drug and then crossed over to another treatment for four weeks. The results showed that the combined ic-pge1-50-mg dose was more effective than placebo in improving their ability to recover spontaneous erencections after radical retro pubic prostatoplasty. After two weeks, only 76 patients completed because of relapses from blinded initial reviews. On the other hand, spontaneous function occurred in only 2 % of both groups. Post-operative intranavernous alprostadasis combined with Sildenaf improved recovery of spontaneous penile function following nerve sparing repertinance. This study also examined the role of combination therapy -- intraaversal alpropstadil and Sildennasol -- on the recovery by spontaneous partial eryection during retropubic prosatectomy. A significant difference between the two groups was observed in the proportion of patients who could have medication-free intercourse. For all men who presented within six months after surgery, the International Score of Erectility Function was defined as 'a level of Satisfaction of 4 or 5, on / 5 point scale'. When no response was found, it was determined that sexual function was not sufficient for satisfactory sexual experience. Simdenenaphil is generally safe and should be used initially for treatment of japaneous men with epilepsy."
21266418,"In this paper, Turku University uses food frequency questions to determine the daily dietary needs of 191 female patients aged 9- 15 years. The mean concentration of 25-hydroxyvin D in the subjects was 62.9nmol/d and in a majority of subjects it was less than 37.5Nmolol/l. A 14 year follow-up is performed on 581 girls who were breastfed without taking any form of vitamin D or calcium. Bone mineral content and bone mineral denition are measured by single photon absorption. Body weight and sports activities during adulthood were stronger predictors of female bone mass than was diet. This study examines the effects of either food-based or pill supplements on bone health in girls age 10-16 y. Both groups showed greater increases in total body bone Mineral Denition after 12 months of treatment."
29018544,"In this study, we examine the effect of a single-blind intervention on changes in ankle tuck jumping performance. The results suggest that adding an external focus to training can be more effective than providing only internal focus. We also investigate whether giving external focused attention to an injury-prone group can reduce the risk of injury by reducing the severity of the injury."

Furthermore, we will use a multifaced intervention strategy that uses GPs' participation in surveys and reviews as part of evaluating the effectiveness of two different methods of improving the care of post-MIout patients. These strategies include physician visits and reminders; however, they do not lead to improvement in blood pressure or any other measures of health. We conclude that there is little evidence of improved quality of care among patients with severe convalescent heart diseases."
31080644,"The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of eras, an interventional program for patients with malignant disease, could be used to improve periodic outcomes and survival. In 103 patients, there were no significant differences between overall survival or recurrance in terms of outcome after propensity matching. There were also no differences in post-operative complications. A pilot study conducted at the Japanese Translational Oncology Hospital found that the efficacy of the modified ERAS regimen was superior to conventional management. After seven days, the evaluation of nutrition status, including totalprotein, albumin, prealbumine, pa, and transferrinal, were significantly greater than those in regular group. Percentage of R0 Resections did not differ from groups ; 93 p.. This suggests that a more standardized approach to surgery may be useful in reducing long-term morbidity as well as in improving patient recovery."
27124041,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective study on patients who underwent Roux-y gastric bypass for at least six months. We conclude that it is necessary to identify the cause of anemia and its association with other risk factors after surgery. This study was designed to compare the effects of diet restriction in the first year following bariatic surgery with those of lifestyle and intense medical management. The results showed improved control of blood pressure, weight, and body mass index in both treatment groups. However, there were no significant differences in severe complications between the two groups; only one group had fewer complications than the other. Both groups achieved greater improvement in quality of life measures than either group."
27236454,"In a doubleblind, placebo controlled study, Piracetram improved language recovery in patients who had been stricken with acute stroke. After 12 weeks of treatment, the group showed significant gains in reading and short-term memory. The other side of the pooled pool also showed improvements in writing and reading ability. A new class of medication called nootropical was used to treat epilepsy. It was found that it could be used as an anti-anxiety drug for patients suffering from severe orphanage-like conditions."
15674903,"In this study, the most efficacious intervention for preventing long-term physical activity is an exercise intervention that involves six motivational and financial incentives. The results of the trial are not significant; however, it does lead to improvements in health over a period of several months. A brief intervention was only effective at short term but did not last longer than one year. This study investigates the relative effectiveness of self-instrumentation and health hazard appraisal on intention to exercise by using the Canadian Home Fittest and Health Hha as predictors. After two years, both groups improved significantly in terms of weight, body massindex, heart rate, and fat. However, these results do not seem to have any significant effect on physical behavior over time. Physician-based assessment and counseling for exercise is used as evidence against physician-induced changes in decisional balance, selfefficacy, or behavior change. Two low-cost exercises were studied among older adults living in community centers. One group received mailed stage targeted print intervention designed to promote physical movement among healthy freed-living older persons. Both groups showed substantial improvement between baseline with 6 months follow-up. These studies suggest that more intense sustained intervention may be necessary so that promote the adoptment of physically activity among mentedentary / middle-aged individuals in primary care settings. Physical activity has been shown to be beneficial in people with Type 1 diabetes. Although there are no significant differences from group to group in regard to their fitness and disease status, further research is required about how best to implement such lifestyle changes. Self-report physical activities are measured before and after they are prescribed. They are also examined in patients with type 2 Diabetes who receive regular exercise advice. At least half of them meet the recommended levels of moderate intensity exercise. For example, walking improves bone mineral density in women who have suffered an Upper limb fracture. Walking increases blood pressure by increasing the amount of fibrinogen which can be converted into glycogen."
30940176,"This study consists of three groups of patients who have been instructed to follow an eight-week walking program. The subjects spend 74.3 m.w. day sitting, 17.5 min. a.c. daily steps, and are measured by accelerometers. At the end of the trial, there is no significant change in physical condition or modest increases in ""customary activity"" in the control group. In contrast, the participants following the walk program do not show any significant changes in their health or work performance. A parallel-group randomised intervention was designed to examine the effect of an activity-monitoring device on the health of nurses at work. It was found that this device did not lead to improvement in body mass or waist circumferentiality. However, it did improve blood pressure and heart function for nurses working in cardiovascular settings. Physicians were asked to report their daily step count as well as their actual work hours. They were divided into four groups: 1) usual sitting time; 2) sit/lying times; 3) task-based activities; and 4) exercise-specific activities. After two weeks, they had improved their average daily standing time by 9 p.t. percent. Sitting periods were lower than those associated with pain in neck shoulders. Although these studies suggest that office workers should be encouraged to increase their physical activity levels, we conclude that such measures may not be sufficient to prevent disease from developing."
26658704,"The aim of these studies is to assess whether combined nurse-led health education and community based intervention can improve the control of Type 2 diabetes in African Americans. Although results are clinically important, they do not reach significant significance at 12 month follow-up. In addition, there are few or no evidence on a combination primary care/community-based approach. A1c changes significantly over time among control subjects; however, not group care patient's: Brutus Type 2, Diabetes Knowledge and Self-Caring Skills and Attitudes to Diabetes were measured on Four topics before thestructured teaching. After six months, knowledge of disease improved with group treatment but not with individual care. This study examines the use of an attention-control condition for patients with poorlycontrolled Hispanic Type 1 diabetes who receive usual care in their own neighborhood. It was found that this condition did not improve blood glucose control as well as other measures such as body mass index and weight. Furthermore, it showed that self-care behavior had been more effective than physical activity in improving quality of life. These findings suggest that ""culturely competent  diet self management intervention"" could be used to improve health outcomes in Latinas without increasing risk of complications."
28836492,"In this study, Wuthering Heights demonstrates that a diet high in whole grain and low in refined wheat can lead to changes in blood phospholipid composition. The results of the previous studies suggest that consumption of nuts may be an effective treatment for Type 2 Diabetes. This trial is registered at the clinical trials as NCT03293175; it does not show any significant change in serum metabolic disease markers or inflammation over the study term. However, there is some evidence that eating nuts improves health in patients with Type 1 diabetes."

Nine of 16, 56 % were not at full depressive at the conclusion of the study; 1 of 19 5 %) imipramin patients reported one to more side effects during treatment. It was concluding that famipexotics provide effective antidepressionant activity with less and less trouble-making sideeffects than impramine All patient who received onedose of study medication are included in the observation-case analysis. The efficiacy and safety results of tanodone or franklin were compared by doubleblind comparison in 61 patients with major Depressive Disorder. Both treatments showed comparable antidemetic effect. A multinational study compares tianostine with FF in 387 subjects with Depressation Episode, Or Recurrent Debilitating Disorder / BipolarAffective disorder. Madrasses responders were better on both regimens. For example, kathisia was reduced from week 7 to 12 but no significant change was seen between the two groups. Two new generations of antidespressants, fluoxer and lutetin, were studied in 161 patients suffering from Major Depression. They had significantly lower means scores on Hamilton Depression Rating scale after 10 days"
26118568,"A solitary surgeon, IRB approved, prospectially ve v, r, and ommized patients were prospectively enrolled. All subjects received the same preoperative protocol; however, at two years' time, the results of both groups were very similar. The direct anterior approach to hip arthrosis was superior to the posterior-approaching approach in terms of early functional scores. Both groups had significantly lower complications than the other group. In particular, there were no differences in age, weight, body massindex, time from entry to surgery or preinjuy HSH score. However, this did not affect the safety of the technique used for hip fractures."
25236305,"In this study, we examine the effect of a three-month intervention on blood pressure in fifty-seven children with prehypertent or hypertension. The efficacy is shown to be increased by the use of vasartan, which reduces both bp and dp for patients who have been assigned to either drug regimen. Adverse event rates were low and comparable among all groups. Children aged 6 months through 18 years treated with amlofdipine had significant decreases after 3 weeks but no dose response relationship was evident. A double- blinded, parallel- group, active-control study was performed. All patients had similar hg and diatolic  Bp as they did before treatment with angiotesin-converting inhibitors or Angiotensinate receptor blockers. No adverse events occurred throughout the study; however, there were some minor ones. Amlopidine was as effective at lowering blood flow as other antihypensive drugs. Both drugs are safe and well tolerated. They also lower vs. placebo's mean stdiaspial blood force from baseline to follow-up. There was no significant difference in reduction in SBP between the two drugs during phase 2: only slight reductions in Dp were statistically significant"
17943736,"In this study, the effect of fish oil on patients with peripheral arterial diseases is examined. The maximum walking ability of these patients was improved by a greater extent than that of placebo. A double blinded cross-over trial was performed in several Italian vascular disease centers to determine whether or not administration of gysaminogen could retard progression and induce regression of atherocities in hypercholestrolemic subjects. This study showed no significant changes in blood lipid concentrations during the trial; however, it did show an improvement in haemostic and rhoological variables. Bezafiebrate does not reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke but only improves pain free walking distance. Two other studies have been conducted: one concerning people with chronic claudicular disease and the other concerning patients who are susceptible to peripheral artery disease. These studies were designed to evaluate the effects of different diets on various aspects of their treatment. One group consisted of high-quality olive oil and another of low-grade corn oil. Both groups had significantly reduced total lipoprotein levels. They also showed marked reductions in both HDL and LDL cholesterol. However, there was little difference in the severity of the disease between the two treatments."
26027632,"The aim of this study is to determine whether a short exercise program can be used to improve walking time in patients with moderately claudicious peripheral artery diseases. In the first two months, both control and supervised groups showed significant improvements in walking ability. After 12 weeks, however, peak walking times increased only by 20 %. A controlled clinical trial was performed on patients who had intermittent boweldication due to mild to moderate chronic obstructive disease. It was found that an eight-week program was most effective for improving walking performance than one week's home-based regimen. However, there were no significant changes in quality of life after six months. This prospective multi-centre observational study examined the effects of sedentary exercise on functional capacity as well as pain-free walking distance in people with severe padiform thrombitism. These patients were divided into two groups: those assigned to receive medical treatment or to exercise alone; and those allocated to attend either group. Both groups improved their health perception using the Short Form 36 Questionnaire. They also reported improvement in physical function and quality measures."
28294172,"In this study, we examine the effects of a single-dose ascorbicacin treatment on flow-mediated dilation in patients with coronary disease. The results suggest that short-lived ascotbic acid treatment may improve endotility and reduce the risk of heart attack. A doubleblind placebo-controlled cross-over study compares 500mg of vitamin C to placebo in fasting blood glucose, serum cholesterol, haemologlobin concentrations, and glycosolated haemiamogloin levels. No significant differences were observed between these two groups; however, there was no significant difference in plasma glutathione levels after treatment. This study suggests that long-term consumption of fruit or vegetables may prevent Type 2 diabetes."

Medicine and science in sports and exercise, 30 / 6 ; 975 '99. Similarly, an increase in MVPa was associated with greater decline in body fat in Latinos compared with non-latinos. This study determines whether short bouts are as effective as long ones for improving blood pressure and weight loss. In this study, overweight female college students were divided into two groups: 1) ""Integration"" -- 2-3 15 min. -- and 2) ""Contex."" After 18 months, mean weight losses were significantly greater in those in the ""SBEQ"" group versus those who had not experienced improved long term weight Loss by exercise participation, cardiorespiatory fitness, or weight gain in overweight adults. ContextTenure Enhancing participation may translate into better long-term lose if prescribed exercise in multiple short-burts than one long burt per day"
21127200,"In this study, we examine the effects of a 12-week program on patients with work-related lower extremity symptoms. The results suggest that use of an alternative geometry keyboard for 12 weeks can lead to improvements in pain, symptoms, and function. This intervention also reduces the risk of injury by reducing the severity of upper arm pain. A further study is performed to determine whether physicians can be more effective in treating chronic shoulder pain than they are in general practice."
26972954,"In this study, we examine the effects of a short-term exercise intervention on patients with Type 2 diabetes. At six months, significant improvements are seen in the intervention arms for exercise, foot care, and goal goals for A1C, LDL, blood pressure, as well as other measures. The results suggest that an individualized approach to patient management may be more effective than traditional approaches. This is supported by comparing control groups who have lost weight after their initial diagnosis to controls who do not. We conclude that ""individualised goals with education and surveillance support might for at least 6 years bring risk factor levels of patients With type 2 Diabetes to... level that has recently been shown to reduced diabetic complications without weight gain."""
17010257,"The effects of a daily iron regimen on anemia, weight, and height in schoolchildren from Baghamoyo district in Tanzania were studied. Hemogen concentration, body weight-and height were measured before and after supplementation. A weekly iron dose was more effective but not in height gain; the average increase in growth was not different between the three groups. Children who received weekly from two schools in Hat Yai village, southern Thaial and,were recruited in 1999. In addition, infants with low haemolin concentration were less likely to receive iron than those receiving placebo from four - nine mo. This conclusion is supported by further evidence that routine iron supplements can benefit those with high haelstonic concentration or normal Hb levels. Iron fortification improves blood Fe levels as well as physical growth in 289 children aged 4-16 y. Preventing iron deficitiency in this population is difficult because there are many poor quality foods available. Fortified food increases iron absorption while zinc does not increase the severity of disease. Infants fed breast milk or nutramigen have twice as many stools as other formula group."
27273067,"In this study, we examine the effects of a fiber-enriched diet on blood trigllyceride concentrations and total cholesterol in mildly hypocholesterolic Japanese men. The results suggest that barley can be more effective than either wheat or other soluble fiber at reducing both low-denity lipophosphoprotein and high-disease-related risk factors. We conclude that consumption of bran flour can reduce LDL-cholesteremic patients by lowering both total and low diacytes while increasing HDL-cholic patients's C-regularity."
28107561,"In this paper, the results of a large, well-controlled trial are presented. The primary aim of the study is to determine whether metoporolol will reduce the risk for sudden death and other cardiovascular events in patients with untreated hypertension. Although no evidence suggests that different drugs may have different effects on preventing these events, several studies suggest that such agents may be effective. These include the American Heart Failure Study, which compares blood pressure control with diuretics, and the European Lacipidine Study on Atherosclerosis, whereby angiotension blockers are more effective than captopriml in avoiding all causes of heart failure. This paper also discusses the use of high-quality observational studies to assess efficacy as well as safety."
25164349,"In this paper, the results of a prospective study on patients with gallstones are presented. The outcome of the study is that there is no significant improvement in pain after laparotomy or elective choecystestectomy when compared to open surgery. A wait-and-see policy for patients who have recurrent acute bilary pain is not recommended because it increases the risk of complications. Cost utility analysis is used to compare the cost of treatment by open and Laparoscopiccholeciasis and by extracororeal shock wave lithopyrpsy. This study also examines the effect of preoperative pain severity on the success of surgical treatment. It was found that early and delayed procedures were more successful than later ones. However, short-term outcomes were still uncertain."
25865603,"The results of this study suggest that the use of the Toronto Cartison Score as a validated measure of sural nerve function in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes is superior to other measures because they relate more closely to aspects of daily life. In addition, the test has good inter-observer and interclass correlations with those of other pain-related measures. Acute herpes disease causes significant negative effects on quality of life and functional status in older adults. This paper uses the Short-form McGillpain Question naire as an instrument for assessing major symptoms of either non-neuropathic or nephroopathic pain. It was found that it had excellent reliability and could be used as part of studies of epilepsy, natural history, and pathophysiological mechanism."
30187695,"In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, exercise is associated with beneficial effects on their joints. The mean increase in damage from the exercise group was 3.5 compared to the usual care group. There were significant changes in pvo2 and 6 mwt after treatment in groups 1 and 2. Aims To compare the effects that conventional exercise, swimming, walking, and ce had beneficial results on the quality-of-life and pulmonary function in patients who had ankylosis. Methods Forty five patients were re-embarked into either swimming or walking for six weeks. No adverse reactions occurred. Therefore, the aim given this study was ""the efficacy"" of high intensity strength exercise on diseases activity andCV health in subjects with active spondying arthrosis."" This study used the American Society for Degrading Artheria Syndrome's instrument, called the Artemus Score, as a measure of disease activity. It was found that there were no differences between the Four ASDAS score versions among different types of patients suffering from RA. However, it was noted that large joint injuries should be avoided because these patients would not be able to perform vigorous exercises."
25456506,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective observational study in which patients with chronic heart failure who were not treated for atrial fist-fighting showed significant improvement in their left ventricular functions. This was followed by an extended period of follow-up studies to determine whether or not these patients could benefit from catheter ablation. The results suggest that it is possible to improve both left and right valgus in patients suffering from congestive hearts failure."
14576382,"In this paper, Dr. Manette demonstrates that angiotension blockade has similar effects on blood pressure in both the acute and long-term setting of strokes. He concludes by stating that although the mechanism by which antigtensin Type 1 is involved may still be unsolved, early nervehumoral inhibition can have similar beneficial effects for cerebral and inmyocardial disease. The aim of the present study is to determine whether or not early neurohumorous inhibition reduces the risk of death from stroke in patients with ischemic heart disease who have a prior history of severe hypertension. Acute cilextil therapy in stroke survivors was designed to assess the safeness of modest blood flow reduction by either dltiazing or diuretics. It was found that there was no significant difference in the relative risk between the two groups. This study also showed that perindopriml protection against repeat stroke could be used as an effective treatment for these patients. Although the efficacy of such regimens had not yet been established, the results are promising."
28264715,"The results of this study suggest that the use of dioxin is not associated with elevated morbidity or mortality. In patients with permanent atriplexation, there is no significant association between smoking and heart failure. A comparison between lenient versus strict rate control two trial as well was used to assess the roles of digoxiin to achieve heart-rate targets. Flutter has been reported in several studies; however, few epidemiological cohort studies have examined it as an atrial fibrillation distinct from atrium fibrillation. Although many patients have died by one year in South American, western Europe, and Australia, among other countries, most patients develop flutter. This disease is especially common in primary care settings because of its long-term consequences."
23927840,"The Alere Net system reduces the rate of hospital admission for heart failure patients in both groups. A reduction in readmissions is associated with improved health-related qualities of life and reduced cost of care. Heart failure is one of the leading causes of relapse in older adults. Both groups have significant reductions in emergency department visits, costs, and readmiss rates. Telemonitoling improves patient quality of Life by reducing the frequency of unplanned hospitalized visits and increasing the time to respond to urgent care needs. In this study, we examine the effect of home-telemonitory on the outcome after an episode that involves acute decopensation. We find that the use of distance technology does not significantly reduce the risk of fatal events from all cause or readmitted to hospital with betterning heart failing. This study furthermore investigates whether remote telemedicine can be used as a preventative measure against death or hospitalization in patients with severe heart fail. It was found that physicians led remote medical management had no significant effects on all cause mortality; hazard Ration, 0.57 ; 95 percent confidence interval : 0.67 to 1.00. These studies are followed by several other studies designed to evaluate the value of using telecommunication devices to improve patient outcomes."
30283040,"In this study, we examine the effects of aspirin on post-operative scar formation in rats. We conclude that it is a good idea to use aspriotin for the treatment of these lesions because it can reduce the amount of scar tissue that adheres to the laminectomy site. The aim of this paper is to determine whether or not simvastain can be used as an effective anti-adhesion agent in rat urethria. It has been shown that aspidin does not have any significant effect on the severity of the disease. However, there are other studies that have suggested using asspirant as part of an additional treatment for patients with severe adhesion problems. These studies suggest that such an aspicin-based regimen may be more effective than conventional surgical approaches."
32274957,"In this paper, we examine the predictors that patients who are more educated, poorer health, and a ""holisticorientation to health"" tend to be more likely to use alternative medicine. We conclude that these factors are highly predicting of other people's behavior toward conventional medicine because they appear to have more congruence with their values, beliefs,and philosophical orientations towards health and life. The results of this study suggest that saw palmeto may be an effective treatment for men with lower-curved symptoms. This is due to the significant improvement in the severity of the symptoms seen in both groups. A further study compares the efficaciousness of permixon 160mg twice daily with placebo in patients with prostatic lesions. It also shows that Tamsuosin has been used as an anti-BPH treatment."
28899233,"The mean rescore of the rs, tto, and sg scores are similar to those of patients with mild-modified heart failure. Cost-utility comparisons between veteran and nonveteran patients show that there is no difference in their health status or quality of life. However, we conclude that congesive heart failing patients should be given more attention because they have better functional status, reduced morbity and mortality, improved qualityof life, as well as reduction in health care costs."
26442959,"Telemedicine is an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes. A telemonitory system uses real-time communication to improve blood glucose control in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 who are not on insulin. The results of the study suggest that this method may be more effective than conventional methods because it allows patients to track their blood sugar levels, report symptoms, and change their lifestyles. In addition, there is a significant increase in haemogen A1c values after 6 months. This paper suggests that using novel medical devices such as cell phones and the web can be used to help patients manage their disease."

The intervention group showed greater increases in minute per day in overall physical activities than the control group. Children in the intervention school had more time to spend in moderate and vigorous physically activity, but no change between groups with moderate or vigorous activity. We also examined the effects that the Toybox-based physical education program had on the Lms and pa levels of minority pre-schooler-aged students. Pretermbirth, vegetation onthe playground, and raininess days were negatively connected with MVPA, while child motor coordination, location of the building on"

This study aims to determine whether the incidence of hip flexo strains in professional ice skating players is related to their injury risk factor. Men with history of inactivity or with higher body Mass Index were at greater injured risk than other males, as were those with lower body mass index. Women had more time-lost injuries than men, but little was known about their Causation. In this study, we examine the ability of physical training to predict injury in infantry recruits. Forty-three female military students were recruited during their first year of school. They were assigned motion controls, stability, or cushioningd shoes for plantsar shapes judgeed to representlow, medium, high arches. The results showed that women who did not suffer an injury were much stronger than those who sustained a stress fracture. Female soldiers had fewer bone stress injuries when compared with boys. Ankle Spains: Thirty two females suffered ankle spains. Athletic injuries were recorded during 1 -3 years and exposed to sport was also recorded. Athlett Spins: All sports injuries occurred during1 - 3 Years and exposure tosport was recorded mean 15.33+/4.33 heav per week. Soccer players have less severe ankle pain than Hispanic patients. National estimates estimate child injury rates from children using the assigned visit weights"
20687074,"In this paper, the authors describe the results of two blood pressure control regimens that have been used in a large number of patients. The first is ramipriml, which retards kidney disease and reduces the risk of death over three years; the second is amlopidine, an anti-hypertension drug that has shown significant reductions in stroke and other mortality. This study compares treatment with placebo in patients with severe hypertension who are not at risk for heart attack or sudden death. Although there is no significant difference between groups, it is clear that both drugs are well tolerated. A patient cohort consisting of 5294 men and women aged 50 to 74 years was recruited in Norway and Swedish hospitals in September 1992 and ended on 15 December 15 1996. After nine centers all university hospitals were in Turkey. Patient recruitment started in Norwegian and Sweden in February of 1992, and after December 15, 15,96 when 10.891 male and female subjects had essential hypertensively had been re-emized. In the initial treatment group they received 30 mg ifedipines GITS, Adalat Crono tablet, or 5 Mg amlaodipine -- Norvasc -- 5-Mg tablet. Both agents were well toleranced by the author. He also describes the outcome of the Prospect ive R and Omised Enalapiril Study Eevaluating Regression of Venturular Enlargement: Preparation for trial. No significant changes in change in vativity occurred during the same period either in monotherapy treatment, sexes, age, race, severity of base hypertrophy, nor in any of their drug regimen's goals. More entalpines treated than nite dipine required supplemental treatments with hydrocholicthiazides 59 %) versus 35 % compared with only atenosolol / 27 th percent less than 22 nd percent. Methods include the African American Study Of Kidney Disease And Hypertension, Scores for eight health dimensions, increased significantly upon physical functioning, role limitations, social function, vitality dimensions from baseline to last follow up visit in the normal MAP goal population. These studies do not reveal any differences between these groups but suggest that calcium antagonists may be more dangerous than beta blockers because they increase the rate of progress of glomerular filtering rate. They conclude that diuretics"

We find that children with hypothyria are more likely to develop deficion than those who do not have a diseased condition. The results suggest that treatment with 5,000 IU daily can be effective in reducing the risk of influenza A in children at high risk for developing anemia."
22617117,"The results of a stroke-relief program are reported in this paper. After two years, the patients receive no significant changes in their quality of life; however, they do show some improvement in physical and mental health. A self-control education program for older women with angina improves their health by improving their physical function and symptom experiences. This intervention also seems to reduce the frequency of heart attacks. In addition, it is shown that there is little difference in the cost of care between the control group and the intervention group."
30872787,"In this study, we examine the effect of daily ergocaliferol or calcecalcifarerol on hip fracture patients. The results suggest that daily doses may not improve physical performance and function in multi ethnically at risk of Type 2 diabetes. We also assess the affect of vitamin D on parathyroid Hormone levels. This study is based on a doubleblind, placebo-control trial with 30 healthy subjects aged 18 to 27 years. At baseline, blood concentrations were low but after four months of intervention, they increased significantly. After 4 months, serum 25-OHD was normalized in all subjects and after 4-months of treatment, there was no significant change in body mineral content. Furthermore, infants received 15 minutes of sun exposure during massage. These studies are published in the Journal of Clinical Trials. They report that pregnant women receive 1,000 IU of Vitamin D for 9 months; children receive 500 iu/day. Children's bone mineral dentition increases as well as their basal bone mass. A double-blindend control trial has been performed with 100 healthy young people from the university who have been divided into three different groups: control group without any other vitamins; one group receiving only 1,500 ions; and another group taking 800 nmolg/ day. Both groups had similar changes in health. However, both groups did not show any significant differences in weight or height. Their mean age was 39 years old. Serum-25-Hystericalvitamin D measured by HLC was found among black, 18.9 ng.m.L., and Asian children. No significant reduction in insulinsensitivity was observed in either group. Insulin sensiton improved when combined with an adequate diet. There was little difference in total testosterone level between the men and the controls. Although some confounding genetic factors could be involved, it was concluded that these factors were most likely to influence response of supplementation in African Americans. Women with lower selfefficacy took the trial medication more frequently than those with greater compliance. Finally, several studies have reported that high-dose deficiencies are associated with reduced risks of common diseases such as heart attack and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. One recent study suggests that higher amounts of alkalinephosphorus should be used to prevent hypercalcemia. Another study reports that rats consume up to 3,000 hippoliterated ointments of morphine per day"
24652601,"In this paper, the authors present a cost-effective evidence-based trial of music therapy for children with an autistic background. They report that young adults with high-functionality in their families report less loneliness and improvement in social skills than older adults who do not have such difficulties. The results suggest that early intervention may be more effective in improving social skill development in younger people with autism. Children with mild to moderately severe ASD are assigned to two different treatment groups: one group is focused on joint attention and another on symbolic play. This study describes the use of ""FaceSay"" as compared to other similar approaches to augmenting child's social learning. It also reports that it has been shown that children receive better social interactions when they receive equines rather than toys."

Athlettes participating in various sports such as football, soccer, basketball, softball and cheerleading report worsening scores on the King Devick test than those not."
21835653,"In this study, we examine the relationship between headaches and temporomandiomas. We find that headache patients have more frequent tooth contact, more musculatory muscle tension, and more pain than controls who do not have headaches. This is similar to those of other disorders, such as ibological disorder and tempromoral disorder. The aim was to determine whether or not the reliability of the diagnoses made by the Rd.D.C. used in this paper are accurate. A total of 266 women aged 18 to 35 years were studied for their myofacial pain."
30264226,"This study focuses on the effects of vigorous exercise on children with attention deficit disorder. Forty patients were assigned into either an exercise group or a control group and their results were compared over three years. The mean age of the subjects was 9 years, and the mean response time was 3 months. Both groups showed significant improvement in their performance. In addition, they found that physical activity was sufficient to improve the symptoms of children who had ADHD. These findings suggest that environment can enhance attention rather than just in the general populace but also in those with ADHD population."
27390451,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the safety and efficacy of a six-month exercise program for patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease. The results suggest that this regimen may be more effective than other forms of exercise for improving balance and gaits in patients who have advanced disease such as psoriasis. In addition, the trial shows that both groups improve in terms of stability and range of motion after the initial period of physical training. This is an important finding because it suggests that there are no significant differences between the two groups at any time during the treatment period. However, several studies have suggested that progressive resistance training might be an effective form of therapy for people with PD. Although these studies do not directly relate to patient disease, they do show some improvement in certain measures. For example, leg muscle strength seems to be improved in subjects with early-stage  PDA. Another study has shown that repetitive step training can reduce falls in older patients suffering from limb weakness."
28854319,"The aim of this study is to determine whether feeding at a rapid or slow pace reduces the amount of time infants must wait for full feeds. In both groups, infant growth and health are improved. Early enteral feeding results in faster weight gain than late-initiated feeding. This trial will have important importance for optimizing incremental milk feeding on very preterm or very low birth-weight babies. A large cohort of prematurely weighed infant girls were studied in order to assess the association between early enterals feeding and the risk of developing necrotizing Enterocolitis. Preterm infant patients had higher risk for neurodegeneration and poor growth when compared with controls who were continuously fed. These studies suggest that early entry intolerance may be associated with poor development in early childhood."

This included 3 slips, 2.1 %), 4 ports problems, 8 patients who had temporary stomato occlesiastical resection, and 1. Mortality. The major outcome was weight loss and improved health status with follow up of 19 months. All patients were female, married, 65.1 / 74.9 %, white, 94.9 percent. Medication declined remarkably. A steady progress of weight Loss has occurred throughthe duration of the trial with 52 x 19 m. EWL At 24 months, 53 22 significant perioperative complications occurred in only 1.2 0% only. Presurgeries adipogenin was lower than leptomin ; insulin resistance : C-react protein & creatinine clearing...and obesity. There are 13 individual sub-groups with different effects whose potential relationship to atherosculotic coronary disease could be predicted. These included cigarette smoking, overt nor borderline diabetesmellitus, an ECG score of 1, and obesity. For these reasons, we defined potential differential effect as those with ""an absolute z value or = 2.0"" for the sub group that would result in more aggressive intervention. In addition, there were seven potential differences between the two groups: 1) an absolute Z-value greater than or equal to 2.0 for each subpart; 2) an Absolute Z values less than 3.0 for both groups; and 3) an relative risk ranging from 0.5 - 2.0 depending on the relative severity of their respective risk factors. Outcomes After surgery were similar among control groups. Diabetes rout rates six years after surgery ranged from 42 vs 57 compared with control group1 and 21.5 respectively.

A pilot study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of ""an automated Diabetes remote Monitoring and Management system"" in reducing blood glucose by one-year follow-up."
28434446,"In this paper, we present the results of a two-hundred-consecuted patient population who have been assigned to either pulvin isolation or PVI plus linear lesions. The first ablation scheme is based on plethic vein isolation and the second on an extended period of time with no drugs. After follow-up, the overall success rate for both schemes is 39 % without antiarthrotics. A long-term outcome is still lacking because atrial recurrances are still common after the first one year. Percutaneous Pulmonolysis has evolved as accepted treatment for Paroxysal or persistent/Permanent affilation but seemed to not be effective in patients that have persistent AF. Both strategies improve the efficacy by reducing the need for additional lines of lesion. At least half of the patients treated with percutaneous pulse therapy remain in sinus rhythm during their follow up. This study also shows that different catheter approaches can be used to treat persistent atrium fibrillation. These include cryoballon technology, which uses electrodes instead of needles to ablate blood from the lungs. It was found that these methods were more effective than conventional methods when compared to single-proceded procedures. For example, it was reported that ""PVI"" alone was successful in 100 pts of lung veins. However, there were significant differences in the duration of followout between the two group: fluoroscopie times were 12.2 min with iPMA vs 5.2  4.1 m min in CB-IV group. Conclusions Long-lived clinical results after fiRM Ablation in this varied challenging cohort showed Poor efficiacy."

The results of the first two studies suggest that treatment with it may be more effective than placebo in improving erector function in men who have spina bowel disease. A second study suggests that sil denafiate can be used to treat obstructive thrombitis in males with type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes. This study concludes that ""vardenalfil"" is an effective but well-tolerable treatment for remission from erectil dysfunction in Latin America. It improves both eryections and performance on the international Index of Elrectility Function Questionnaire.

18725372,"In this study, we examine the effect of atorvastain on the risk of acute fist-throat disease in patients with hypertension. The results suggest that prava statin can be used as an effective anti-inflammatory agent for reducing the frequency of post-elective cardiac surgery. This is a prospective, observational study designed to determine the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophies at age 50 and to predict the severity of these events. We conclude that there are no significant differences between the two groupings but that they have different effects on blood pressure, platelet activity, endothecation, and other markers of inflammation. A recent study suggests that chronic human atrial fibrilation is associated with elevated white blood cells. These studies confirm our previous findings about the association between high levels of red blood cell count and the formation of atrium fibrillations after coronary bypass surgery; furthermore, it has been reported that C-React Protein may help reduce the incidence of spontaneous attrition after elective heart surgery by preventing the development of arrhythmic symptoms."
25414824,"In this study, we examine the effects of an eight-week weight loss program on glyceride control and blood pressure in subjects with type 2 Type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet may be more effective in reducing both body weight and risk of heart disease than conventional approaches. We conclude that eating fewer refined foods can lead to greater weight Loss: ""The lower fat, lower carbogenelic diet, and uc group / P.001 intervention effect""."
22457397,"This paper presents the results of a crossover study in which ten hyperinsulinmic and eleven nonhyperirritinemic men consume five wks each on varying blood metabolite levels. The results show that consumption of either sugar sweeten soft drinks or high-almost-amylate cornstarch is associated with increased risk of heart disease in both groups. In the hypoinsulinemic group, fructosolic and corn starch are more effective at reducing total triumvirate and lipoprotein concentration than they are in the hyper Insulinemian group. Both diets increase fasting vaguscular glcd by increasing the level of risk factors involved with heart diseases. However, there is still debate whether this association is due to an altered lipid metabolism."
29951975,"The results of this study indicate that root canals fabricated with resin-based filling material are more resistant to fracture than those fashioned with cement. In addition, the sealers used in these studies do not increase the resistance of root roots. This is due to the fact that they are filled with polyurethane or amorphous fibers and therefore have less surface area for bonding. However, there is no significant difference in the strength of the root filler when compared to other root-filled materials."

The results suggest that there is no significant difference in the two groups but that both groups improve. A study was conducted to determine the efficability of an experimental treatment combining video tape feedback with occupational intervention compared to just occupational training in learning the skill of donnning socks and boots after stroke. This study uses standardized goal-elicitation methods to assess the effect of routines-based Early Intervention for children with low-back Pain. Both groups score higher on the General Attainerment Score and the Canadian OPM as measures of problem-specific outcome. Two different groups of patients were enrolled: one group received four services and eight patients; the other group had only one service. To determine whether the cluster design influence and minimal clinical significance difference could be explained by stage interactions, we used rescored telephone interview and mail surveys. Results confirm that the CoPM is reliable instruments for use in patient-centered practice in patients who have ankyloping s Pondylitis. We compare the effectiveness of ""constant-induced movement"" therapy with bi-weekly daily exercise for people with severe upper extremity dysfunction caused by Cerbrovascular accident.

28816346,"In this paper, the effects of daily b-vitamines or nicotinics on blood pressure are investigated in patients who have had a long history of heart disease. The results suggest that IV treatment reduces the risk of death by 22 %) and an even greater reduction in the risks of reinfare ion than the relative mortality reduction. Furthermore, there is no evidence that these regimens are more effective than their old IV regime; for example, one such regimen has been used in several small trials to treat thousands of such patients. A study was conducted at two university hospitals in Western Norway in 1999-2006. It showed that folilic acid reduced the rate of first stroke with elevated totalcholesterol levels. However, it did not improve the incidence of any major cardiovascular events among those with high cholesterol. This study also examined the effect of bread folate and vitamins B12 and B16 on fracture risk. These studies were published in journals as well as in national newspapers. They found that multivitamin pills and other anti-CVD drugs were associated with reduced risk from stroke and fatality. There was little evidence against them in women but only in men. Although they may be harmful in some circumstances, they do show beneficial effects on health-regarding quality of life."

After 24 months, there is no difference in clinical scores or maximal total points motion among the two groups. The prothesis group has less early subsidence than either group; however, they do not take clodronates. This study also shows that bone cements can be used to improve fixation of both types of implants. A single-blinded series of knee replaces with cemented or hysteric-encapsulated pieces are followed up for four years. At one year, Porous Coated Implants migrate significantly higher than Cemented Fixation. There is only slight reduction in migrating at 1 year. Level of evidence: Therapeutic level I see the Guide for Authors as an overview of the evidence for surgical intervention. We compare three kinds of fixations of Profix Total Knee Arthroplasties -- Osteonic Type, Boneloc Type,"" and Palacos Type -- on 97 consecutive patient knees treated by surgeons from 12/1999 to 10/2000. All living subjects were followed after surgery. They had no loosening during the first 6 weeks but did not show any changes in the preoperative score. Both methods showed similar pattern of movement throughout the followup period. These studies suggest that Bioactive Coating of TKA might improve early stability ofthe tibially component."

They conclude that a median age of 10 years is suitable for treatment with either surgery or active-survival regimens. Although there is no significant difference in overall survival among treatments, men with localised, disease-specific, or metastatic disease are more likely to survive longer than those with radical protoctectomy. A prospective, open-label, random-experimentation study has found that adding short-term orrogen suppressing therapy to standard treatment improves long- term survival in men who have localizing disease."
30488972,"The effect of a patch that delivers 300 microgs of testosterone daily results in an increase in frequency of sexual desires and improved self-esteem. In this study, the effects of the patch on women with hypo active sexual desire disorder are investigated. Women receiving the patches report significant improvements in their scores on the Sexual Desirability Score and improvement in personal distress. A subset of patients who have adverse events reported in the placebo or patch group were also included. This study is designed to compare the efficaciousness of two different forms of estrogen therapy: high-dose Estrogen alone or combined with molestogen therapy. It was found that both regimens had similar effects on bone mineral density and other symptoms. Both groups showed no significant differences in age or gender. However, they did show increased levels of un bound testosterone and suppressed SHBG. These studies suggest that menopause may lead to greater changes in blood lipid concentrations as well as reduced atherosity."

19567343,"Lactate gel is a promising new treatment for recurrent vaginal yeast infection. Forty two women with severe upper urinary tract disease were initially given an acid gel to be seated in the vagin daily for seven consecutive days. UTIs were eliminated in 100 %) of norficillinacin- treated patients and in 80 % of all those treated with Tamp/SmX. Post-warning, this study suggests that there may be differences in efficacy among different regimens of antibiotics. In particular, it shows that no difference was found in severity of symptoms after either regimen. A double blind trial was performed to determine whether or not probiotic Lactobacili can prevent vulvoginallal candidiasis. The results showed that both groups had significantly reduced the risk of developing venomous lesions; however, they did not show any significant change in overall colonization. Probiotic use was associated with improved health in children who had persistent primary urethritis during their first year of follow up. This study concludes that antimicrobials are inconcludive as to how effective they are. Two self-care methods were used to treat post-anticipatory Urinary Tract Infections: 1) weekly Intrvaginally application of LacTobacillus alphaphilus or 2) weekly intravaganl applications of Clotrizzaole tablet. These studies proved that prophylactic care of virgilia was superior to conventional therapy. Women with recurring urginate infections were more likely to receive estriol cream than placebo. Estriol reduces the frequency of these episodes by reducing the need for repeated IVH treatments. Another study was conducted to assess the efficiacy of proculture against bacterial vagunism. It was shown that lactobilli could restore normality to the female vagolf."

23997134,"In this study, we compare the short-lived results of two different types of knee prosthesis: a fixed ball bearing and an orbital bearing. We conclude that the latter is more forgiving than the other because it has better control over the movement of the fendicular component. This paper also discusses the use of self- Alignment to improve knee function in patients with degenerated knees. The aim of these studies is to determine whether the wear of polypropylene on the bearing or the motion of its bearing will lead to pain. Both designs have similar pain scores at three and six months after surgery. However, they do not show any improvement in quality of life during follow-up. A prospective double blind trial is performed to compare outcome between 61 patients who received either cruciate bearing/rotating platform knee replacement or those who had both devices. There are no significant differences among the two groups; however, there is no difference in range of motion from one group to another. After two years, neither group shows any change in patient health. Another study is conducted to evaluate the effect of several features including metal backing, patellare resurfacing, and 'a cell bearing between the fimoral and pegular components'. It is reported that all knee implants are uncemented except for posterior ligament management which is sacrificed by the LPS design. Two years later, the results are reported. At least as good as the fixed bearing type. No complications occur in either group. For example, when compared to the rigid bearing device, only the ""FB"" knee does not suffer any problems."

This results in a reduced risk of developing cardiovascular disease among newly diagnosed type two patients. After 5.0 years, 6 p.m. had remitted from their initial period of follow up. A compositeprimary CVD outcome examined comprised of: cardiovascular mortality; nonfatalmyocardialinfa ct-ion ; stroke; and cancer. We hypothesize that an intervention based upon the Mediterranean diet would have greater protection against diabetic ritnopathy and no further health consequences than consuming 'a healthy diet'."
25848343,"The safety of the first two regimens is described. In this study, patients with early stage breastcancer were randomed between preoperative and postoperative treatment. They showed no significant differences for disease free survival or overall survival in comparison to conventional treatments. However, they found that the expression of Ki67, phosphorus, and tubuline III were independent prognosestic factors in women receiving adjuvenient chemotherapy for early breastcy. Aaccrisy concludes that there is no relationship between Ki-57 and treatment allocation; however, it is believed that anthraxel will prolong time to respond. This trial was designed to evaluate whether increasing the dosage of doxerubicin or adding docetaxell would prolong life after breast cancer. It was concluded that both regimend at different doses had better diseasefree survival than either regimented at the same intensity. After completing their follow-up studies, 6,39 patients experienced one event. The main endpoint was patient-respectable survival after five years. Although some patients received more frequent thrombosis than others, neither regiment did significantly improve disease-free outcome. For example, CMF improved disease freedom as compared to standard therapy in terms of pathological response. There was also no difference in the rate of death among patients treated with concurrently administered drugs. Predicative factor analysis was carried out using clinicopatological markers including hormone receptor status, age, menopauseal status etc. Associations are assessed with Counties proportional hazards modeling. These results suggest that FEC-priced treatment reduces the risk of repeat relapse by 23 % relative to TAC-PW. Furthermore, Bvacicizumab has been used as an anti-Oncogene in breast tumors."
21383023,"This study focuses on the effects of resistance training on older adults. It is shown that resistance-training improves both strength and power in older people, but it is not entirely clear whether this is due to an overly high intensity or a lack of restraint. The results of this study suggest that short-term resistance exercise may be more effective than long-lasting endurance training for improving physical function in elderly patients."
29955550,"The present study assesses the safety and effectiveness of varenialline for treatmentof concurrent nicotine and drinking dependence in schizophrenia. Specifically, it was found that varicline had a greater risk of adverse events than either group when compared to placebo. In addition, there were no significant differences between the relative neuropsyiatric risks or efficacy among patients with and without mental illness. Although these results are encouraging, they do not necessarily support the use of this particular drug as an intervention for smoking abstinatement in people with serious mental illnesses."
20097493,"The first-day effects of probiotics on preterm infant health were compared in three groups: the control group received no supplement; the early-stage group was given Lactobacilus GG, which colonized the bowel and reduced the number of pathogens present at birth; and the late-onset group had no effect on the outcome. In this study, twenty premature infants aged 33 to 36 weeks were studied from their initial initiation of breast feed until discharge. They were divided into 3 groups with either milk or formula fed with Lactobacillus G, respectively. After two weeks, the stool frequency was lower than that of the placebo group. A further study was conducted to determine whether gut colonization of premature babies is improved by feeding oligostesacchardes at 10 g per day. This study examined the efficacy of adding bifdobacterinia to dietetic preparations for infant growth. It was found that there was no significant change in the rate of infection after seven days of consumption. However, it was noted that the use of these compounds did not lead to any adverse effects."
25148386,"After five years of treatment, the blood pressures in the two groups are reduced significantly. In addition, there is a significant improvement in both measures of quality of life after one year. The results of this study suggest that use of either angiotension-converting enzyme blocker like telmiartan or ARB can be used to prevent Type 2 diabetes and hypertension from developing into serious disease. Both drugs have good tolerated effects on these patients. For example, they reduce systelic blood flow by reducing the amount of time it takes for the patient to reach his desired blood vessel size. These results confirm that ""treatment with either ramipriml or valsaran is associated with considerable reductions"" in blood force. This suggests that antihypertinesive therapy may be more successful than other agents in treating hypertensives."
32145741,"The effects of rogen-replacement therapy on lower Urinary Tract symptoms in hypogonal men with benign Prostatic Hypertrophy. In contrast, the concoction of F and T appears to reduce the impact of treatment on prostatic size or other complications in elderly men. This study is a doubleblind, placebo controlled trial designed to examine the effects that testosterone replacement therapy has on body composition, muscle mass, and physical function in patients with advanced disease. Bioavailable testosterone levels increase from an initial mean of 126.3 ng/Dl to 360.4 nmol Omol/L; no change occurs in the controls. A further study was conducted to determine the effect of transdermal testosterone on bone mineral density and biochemistry in older men who have low bloodtestogen levels. These men were divided into three groups: 1) subjects received either PTT or no exercise 2) subjects took one dose of testosterone per day or twice daily 3) subjects had resistance training. Both groups showed significant improvements in their performance, strength, weight, etc. They also showed signs of improvement in heart function. However, they did not show any changes in quality of life."
32249071,"A randomized, cross-over study of 15 patients with Cystic Fibrosis using logistic regression to predict the severity of the disease. In this study, we examine the effect of short-term consumption of retinil palmitate on the growth and health of infants in children with a severe form of chronic obstructive rheumatism. The results suggest that retinol binding proteins can be used as an effective anti-inflammatory agent. This study compares the effects of two different types of fat meal: lystophosphoidyliccholine or triacylglucerol. It is concluded that OLM has beneficial effects on both acute and long term pulmonary function."
17088502,"This study aims to determine the time course and type of early behavior changes that accompany recovery in depressed subjects. After one week of treatment, DMI produces greater reductions on motor retardation than paroxertine and placebo. The different types of Ads initially impact different aspects of the disease. Short-term treatments have similar effects on mood and hostility as they do on anxiety. A parallel group, doubleblind study was performed for 6 weeks after a single week washout period. Forty two male and female patients were assigned to seven days of double blindd intervention with either escilopram, naivete, or sertraline. Significant improvements were observed at earlier timespoints in both groups; however, sertriline treatment was associate with increased gypsy side effects and an tendency toward early withdrawal. Both active treatments are effective in treating major depression. In addition, there is no evidence that serotonergic dysfunction is involved in this condition. Paroixetine is more effective than fluoxetine in the treatmentof major disorder. Fluoxtonine is superior to venlafine extended release in outpatients with Major Depressive disorder because it is associated with reduced risk of adverse events."
31464396,"In this study, we examine the effects of trans fatty acid consumption on lipophospholipids in healthy subjects. We find that palmitic and coconut fat are more effective at reducing total cholesterol than palmelic or ol' alkylated fats; however, they do not seem to have any significant effect on blood lipid levels."
24917590,This study focuses on the relationship between physical activity and functional performance in adult patients with knee pain. The results of this study suggest that exercise may be more effective than diet in improving health-related outcomes for adults with moderate to severe knee Ostearthritis.
22776399,"Forty eight participants perform various activities, chosen to represent light, moderate, and vigorous intensitys. In cross validation, the mean estimations using the new method were within 0.5 metabolic equivalents of measured metris for each activity performed.

15774495,"Digoxin improves exercise capacity in patients with acute heart failure who receive diuretics and an anotensin converting enzyme blocker. A double blinded crossover study was designed to determine the efficaciousness of biventricular-pacing in subjects with mild to severe heart failing. The results were not significant, however, for quality of life or functional status. Fusemide improved left ventricular functions but was associated with higher risk of adverse events. Betablockade is used in treating syphiltolic dysfunction from a myomyopathies' disease. This trial compares the effects of beta blockers on left ventricle function in adult patients suffering from chronic heart fail. In addition, it has been reported that metoproll may be more effective than captopriml in terms of improving symptoms and quality"
15106221,"In this paper, the authors present a revised version of their original statement about iodedized oil. They include new evidence for its efficacy against goitre and suggest that it may be used as an alternative to conventional methods of treatment. A double blind, rand-omized control intervention was carried out on 196 schoolchildren in northern Bainin, Benin country. The results suggest ""catches up"" in terms of psychological performance over the intervening period. All indicators had improved greatly except for thyroid volume, which had declined only in the group with improved status. Both groups showed no significant differences in rate of Somatic growth or performances on the Stanford Binet test. However, they supported the possibility that correcting ill-treated ions may improve mental function in school age girls. Fortified biscuit is more effective than mineral oil in reducing iron deficency in children from poor rural communities. There are fewer school days missed because of respiratory disease and diarrhea- related illnesses. Children received 200mg I orally; was observed for thirty wk during which Urine / TSH concentrations were measured at base and increase in all groups until 18 months. This suggests that if there is any relationship among ividine variables, hearing and mentally performance in mildly illiterate population, then breast milk is better even than feeding of an appropriate amount of ivedisinate salt. Goiter prevalence in villages where salt is not available is reduced by using potassium uodide instead of potassium bimonthly."
30368675,"In this study, Wu et al identify the causes of fall in elderly people and determines that cold climates are associated with higher rates of falls. They also report that women living in cold states have more than twice the risk of hip fracture as those who live in warmer climated regions. This study further investigates the connection between sunlight and fall incidents in population at different levels of latitudes to determine whether fall is related to the amount of home assistance received. The results of this investigation indicate that sliping on ice or snow seems to completely explain the excessive frequency of winter falls among older people. There was no difference between one time and recurrence fallers; however, there were no differences in the severity of the injury. A prospective cohort study was carried out on people aged age 65 years and over followed up from 1900 to 1997. Case numbers were identified through an prospect i've registry system. It was concluded that ""season affected the incidence of arm fractures"" for all types of broken bones except shoulder injuries. For example, according to Wu-ettingal studies, it appears that walking on uneven surfaces is the most common cause of falling. However, these studies do not reveal any association between falls and other health problems. According to Woo enylvania, trips and slips seem to be the primary cause by which many elderly subjects fall. After the observation period, subjects were divided into four groups based upon fall status: non-falleners, one-to-time faller, and two-recurrent fallpers. These factors did not influence the outcome of their study. As expected, they showed no significant relationship between the timing of events and the consequences of them. Fall occurs during daylight hours but often occurs while subjects walk on flat or uneven surface. Such data, however only in community dwelling elders, are scarce especially in communities where such conditions are relatively scarce."
26841160,"In this study, we describe the effects of a single dose of letosolole on pain and quality-of-life in women with endogenosis. We conclude that laparoscopic surgery is more efficacious than placebo at relieving pain but improving quality of Life. A prospective, double- blinded, cross-sectionally based study was performed to compare the effect of two different forms of treatment for patients with severe endometrial lesions. The results showed that both forms were effective in treating pain; however, there was no significant difference in the severity of symptoms between the groups. Six months after surgical excision, all the women improved their scores on the Score-Question scale. After six months, sexual function improvement was observed among the patients submi imitated to intestinal segmentation resection as well as nodule shrouding. There was also some evidence that combined surgical and medical treatment can be used to treat endormetriosesis without any risk of complications. This paper describes an observational cohort trial of over 100 women who had been treated with complete or partial vaginal desecration of their rectovagilia. They found improvements in physical and mental status upon completion of the surgery."
31408248,"In this study, we examine the relationship between persistent and early-onset use of cannabis in 16 adult volunteers. We find that an earlier age is associated with worse performance on the Cognitive-Behavioral Task after controlling for severity of exposure to the drug. This finding supports the notion that cues induce a psychological response to illicit substance use. The results suggest that there may be some basis for treatment of chronically addicted adults. A prospective, cross sectional study was conducted among 1,037 people aged from birth to age 38 years who had used or consumed any amount of alcohol during their lifetime. It found that smoking high concentrations of THC increased anxiety as well as symptoms of intoxicating and sedation. However, it did not lead to significant increases in the risk of developing maldoetic disease. Furthermore, these findings do not extend to patients with mental illness."
27496935,"Aims To evaluate the effects on body composition and motor function of older women in a hot spring water environment. The results showed significant improvement in gaitpattern and recovery timeafter perturbed Gait, we conclude That aqua aerobic therapy was an effective exercise technique for training older adult to reduce their risks of falling. Thirty seven elderly were re- assigned to waterbased training or omically assigned control group. After 12 weeks, the primary benefit that include perturbation to induce stepped steps was reducing voluntary steppingtimes. In the water-base group, performance improved after training for hip extenors, muscles, and plantarflexor's muscles. This study is designed to determine the efficacy of water exercises on health- related quality of life in community-dewling elderly people. It shows that both groups show improvements in physical functions as well as in mental health. Both groups have similar retention rates at six and twelve months. Adherentity to swimming or Walking is similar after 6 and 12 month. Water-based exercises seem to be more effective than other forms of exercise because they involve resistance and are not specific enough to cause changes in muscular strength, flexibility, or body mass."
26888713,"Two years later, we examine the relationship between the Fto-rs99309609 allele and body weight in European children. The risk allel is associated with higher BMI, waist circumference, skinfolds, and long- term weight changes in a Swedish Diabetes Prevention Study. In this study, 522 subjects aged 40 to 65 years were assigned different diets for their weight loss. At 6 months, they lost an average amount of six pounds. After two years, both diet groups had similar effects on fat mass, body composition, blood pressure, appetite, etc. They also found that there was no significant difference in leptenin levels after treatment with either diet group. This study confirms the association between these two genetic markers. We examined the effect of the C-type genotype on changing food cravings or appetite scores in 732 overweight adults who were randomized to either lowcarbogeneous or highfat diet over three years. These results suggest that the combination of lower carbogenetics may be beneficial in improving weight control."
21710185,"In this study, we examine the effect of a diet change on infants with concholic who have been breastfed for six weeks. The results indicate that there are more likely to be colics in low-allergic children than in those with high-allergen parents. We also assess the efficacy of soy and cow's milk as treatment for infantile colicky disease. A double blind, tasked control group was used to determine whether or not feeding an infant formula with either casein or dairy extract would reduce crying. This trial showed that both formulations were equally effective at treating infantil constriction. However, it was found that some babies had greater severity of symptoms when they were treated with cow ""milk-free diet"" rather than with any other form of treatment."

30647466,"In this study, we examine the effect of a single daily dose on blood pressure in type 2 patients with essential-hypertension. The results suggest that adding melatone to the regimen may be more effective than metformin in treating these patients. We also investigate whether nighttime consumption of Melatonine can reduce the risk of heart attack in patients who are at risk for acute myosmoporotic events. This is an important outcome because it indicates that there is little evidence for the efficacy of long-term morphine therapy in Type 2 diabetes."
25443649,"This study consists of three groups of breast cancer patients: 1) aerobic exercise 2) resistance exercise 3) usual care control. The first group is assigned to ""relieve"" fatigue, while the second group receives ""general care."" Both groups complete the revised Pipering Fatigue scale and the 6- minute walk test at baseline and 12 week post-execence program. All participants complete two tests: the Timed Getup and Go test and an assessment of functional capacity using the Bjor PerceiveD Exertion scale. A significant difference between the two controls was found for all parts of the test. In contrast, the ETGUg test showed high test reliability in comparison with the other tests. Ninety six community-dweling elderly subjects performed four clinical tests; they were divided into four groups: young, old 'nimpaired', and elderly subject at risk of fall. These results indicate that neither exercise significantly improves self-esteem, physical fitness, body composition, or chemotherapy completion rate but they do improve health-related quality of life without causing disease or adverse events. After 8 weeks of followup, 78 breastcancer survivors were assigned either core stability exercises or massage myofascia release. There was no significant change in age or activity level after the intervention. However, there was a significant decline in the relative frequency of decline due to age. Furthermore, peak and OV0312.o2 was predictor of survival in heart failure as well as in transplantation. Thus, these results suggest that exercise may be useful in improving pain and function in women who have had chest surgery."
30516592,"In this study, we systematically examine the experience of our center's treatment of patients who have acute appendices. We conclude that it is safe and efficacious as a initial-line therapy for unselected adult patients with acuteappendiciitis with relapse after favorable initial treatment response. Antibiotic treatments are safe but effective in unseen adults with severe acute or chronic disease. The cumulative probability for realapse was : / 0.09 ;.12,.00 ... n =40 perforations Postoperatively diagnosed by pathology had no secondary finding."" This suggests that antibiotics may be an effective first line treatment for children with moderate to severe uncomplicationated acute abdominal pain. A prospective observational study has been conducted over three years to assess the efficacity and safety of short-lived antibiotic therapy on consecutive subjects with mild appendingicitis. Following follow-up by telephone interview, the primary endpoint will be the success of ""the r and Omized treatment."" After two years, all patients receive initial antibiotics with clinical observation at 48 hours. No complications occurred in any of the patients treated with long-term regimens except for one patient who had fewer day of pain medication."
26103030,"Incontinence Diaries A prospective study comparing the efficaciousness of cannanbinol with placebo in treating multiple sclerical patients. The results suggest that it is possible to use this drug as an alternative treatment for patients who have severe pain and are not sensitive to other drugs. For example, one patient has a tendency to vomit while another has no such problem. This paper also discusses the effect of cannabis extract on spastitic symptoms in Multiple Sclerosis. It was found that there were no significant side effects when compared to placebo. However, after two weeks, the mean frequency of vomiting episodes increased from 4.76 to 12.95. Four of 19, 19 patients complete only one cycle because of absence of efficiacy or chemotherapy toxication. Another trial compares butyropenone analogous domperigone with synthetic cannic nabilione. Both treatments showed significant improvements over placebo; however, they did not show any difference in nausea or food intake. Dron-absorption resulted in more than 30 percent reduction in pain intensity during the first three months of treatment. There was little change from baseline among opioid background medication nor mean number of dosages of breakthrough medicine across treatment groups. Most drug related adverse events occurred mild/moderated in severity. 8een of 24 consecutive eligible children aged 10 months up to 17 years completed the trial. Canninoid therapy seems to be better tolerated by these patients since it does not cause serious sideeffects. They do not report any major safety concerns. We performed r and Omized doubleblind cross-over trial using delta 9-tetralhydrocoannabinal in 12 adult patients with chronic malignant pain. No serious complications occurred during either trial except for minor side reactions. After four days, each patient received fixed dosesof placebo, dronatrol, ondansoltron, or combination therapies. NauseA intensity and vomitingRetching were lower in patients treated With dramonola. active treatments were well toleranced with majority of adverse event occurrences including intoxicating type reactions being milder and resettling spontaneously."
31833645,"Preschoolers' physical activity and body composition are related to their health, but there is little evidence of a relationship between these two. This study aims to determine whether weight status affects motor skills in young children. Preparations for school begin with an assessment of the effects of daily activities on children's health. The results suggest that early childhood changes in both physical and mental health are associated with improved health later in life."
29178962,"The International waist-to-heart scale is used to measure health status in a large population of patients. It is found that there are significant differences between groups on the body mass-index scale, and this suggests that the IWQuOL-lite scale may be useful for measuring weight loss."
29635250,"In this study, we examine the effects of a genetic test on smoking behavior. Carriers report greater improvement in their self reported total paternal activity after six months than carriers who do not have any risk factors. We conclude that ""personalized advice"" based on genotype or disease information will lead to larger changes in health behavior than nonpersonally-regarded advice. This study is designed to determine whether an intervention that includes genetic information for lifestyle-related risks increases risk perceptions as well as rates of smoking Cessation. The results indicate that providing personalized guidance relying on genomic testing does not increase susceptibility and improves weight control. However, it does reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes."
26053004,"A pilot study evaluating an integrated approach to treating type 2 diabetes in older African Americans was conducted. The results showed that patients who received follow up at monthly or three-month intervals improved their health and were less depressed than those who had been given usual care. This study also examined whether objective clinical, patient performance, quality of life, and subjective outcome were significantly different among American men with Type 2 disease. In this study, the effect of a structured self-management program on blood glucose control was evaluated. There was significant improvement in both measures for diatolic bp, serum cholesterol, diet, physical activity, as well as medication adherence. Although there was no significant difference in the mean change in Hba1c levels over time, it was not significant enough to suggest that these improvements were due to changes in knowledge, selfefficacy, behavior, or medication regimens. It was concluded that ""provider-level intervention"" was more effective when compared with standard care approaches. For example, during the first year of the trial, Hispanic adults with newly diagnosed Type 2, received greater improvements in health status, emergency departmentutilization, dietary habit, exercise,and medication absorption. They did not improve their overall health-regarding quality; satisfaction with care; and other humanist outcomes."
31399113,"In this study, we examine the effect of two lingual brackets on enamel decalcification and cavitation. We found that there was no significant difference between the appliance type, gender, treatment complexity, age, or treatment duration in terms of white spot formation. The results suggest that using these new technology may be more effective than conventional orthodontic appliances for reducing tooth caries. This is an important issue because patients often have difficulty fitting their new braces into their mouths."
26724178,"This is the first large-scale, long-term study of blood pressure in elderly patients. It consists of three groups: 1) patients with high risk for major cardiovascular events; 2) patients without hypertension; and 3) patients who are at least able to tolerate moderately high blood levels. The results suggest that treatment with an antihysteric drug such as irresartan may be beneficial for elderly people with low blood values. In this group, however, there is a significant reduction in all causes of death from either type of therapy. A dose of ramipriml reduces the risk of fatal or non fatal myo Cardiol infa Ct Ion, stroke, or death by 6.1 percent relative risk compared with 18.1 percent in placebo group. There is no effect on Major Cardiomorbidity. These studies were conducted at general practitioners' offices across the United States."
15078851,"In this study, we describe the use of a combination of post-operative and adjuvenient therapy to treat patients with breastcancer. Although there is no significant survival difference between the two treatment groups, it is highly significant that ""the presence of more or = four negative nodes"" and the percent of ideal dose of chemotherapy receive are the strongest factors predicting survival. The results of this trial indicate that the presence either of three or four positive node can lead to improved survival in women with both types of breast malignancies. A subsequent study suggests that pneumatic compression may be useful for improving patient comfort. This paper also discusses an earlier attempt to determine whether internal mammar chains are included as part of the target volume of radiation therapy. It was found that only one third of all patients had skin reactions equal in both group. After mastectomy, patients were treated according to their stage; they received either L-PM or cyclopsphamide or methotreXate. When added to chemotherapy, the risk of distant recurrance was reduced without any adverse effects on outcome. However, after 7 years of followup, however, these patients showed remarkably increased reliability free of disease. For example, at 8 years' time, lung fibroses were developed in patients who received TAM instead of conventionally irrational treatments."
21154392,"A prospective, randomized, double- blinded, placebo-control study comparing the efficaciousness and tolerableness of quetapine as maintenance mono therapy for patients with anxiety disorder. In this trial, all active treatment groups produce significant improvements on the Panic Anxiety Score, Hamilton Rating scales for Anger, Quality of Life, enjoyment and satisfaction Questionnaire, and adverse events. The most frequent adverse reactions are dry mouth, somnolation, fatigue, dizzines, headache, nausea, constipations, but not paroxene. This multiconre rand/omized group of patients was divided into two groups: 50 mg or 200mg qutiapine XR; 20ml parodytine, nor placebo. Conclusions Although conclusions are somewhat preliminary, we do not support that addition of quitita pine to continued Paroixetine regimen for individuals with anxious or depression who remain symptoms after 10 weeks in an attempt to improve their condition. For example, panic disorder is one of those common anxiety disorders. However, many patients report improvement in both severity and frequency of symptoms when augmentation is given. These results suggest that amorphous antipsychotics may be useful adjunctive treatments for people with generalized anxieties."
27325129,"In this study, we examine the prevalence and incidence of rogen-deficiency among men aged 40-69 years. We use a population-based observational survey to assess the association between symptomatic deficions and low endogenous levels of testosterone. Men with lower levels had 40 % higher risk of falling than those with higher levels. This study is aimed at predicting future health problems in older men. The results suggest that men with low levels are at greater risk for developing cardiovascular disease."
28639965,"Selenium increases the concentration of seluteum in whole blood after 30 days and 60 days, compared to placebo. Selenium also improves the efficacy of antithirsty drugs in Graves' disease. In this study, we examine the effect of long- term use of 200 mmol/d as l-Selenium orally for six months on serum levels of TPOAb, CXL9, and Thrypro. The mean concentration decreases by 49.5 percent in the selentium treated group vs 10.1 pmol per day inthe placebo group. This is an important finding because it suggests that seleniUM may have beneficial affects on autoimmune thyroidism but does not appear to be effective on Gravies' hyperthormonismm."
27609849,"A naive, unmarried group of patients with mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injuries is compared to those who are not depressed. The results of the study suggest that there is no significant difference in functional outcome between rural and urban patients suffering from severe trauma. However, the addition of gabbt to psychological rehabilitation does not result in improvement in mental health. In contrast, it does lead to improvements in quality of life."
30544134,"This study focuses on the use of contact forces to ablate atrial fibrilation in patients who have a high risk of complications. It compares two cryo-balloon catheters used for ablation, one that uses force and one with no force. The results suggest that both methods work well. In this study, we examine the effect of using force on left atrium mapping and pulmonary vein isolated treatment of persistent atarrhythmic disease. There is no significant difference between the two groupings in terms of success after 1 year. We also assess the safety of an advanced technology called ""catheter bearing force sensing"" which can be used to track the tip of the catheter and thus provide real-time information about the patient's blood flow."
31571503,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates the utility of an instrumented balance board as a measure of postural instability in people with moderate to mildly severe Parkinson's disease. The testretest reliability for the device is high, and the intraclass coefficients are. 80 and 84 respectively. A further study is performed to estimate the mean-distribution-curves scores of the two tests used to predict future fallfalls in subjects with mild or moderately serious PD. This study uses the same cohort of patients who had been tested on medication as the previous study. Although the tool has some drawbacks, it does have good general validity. For example, the Fes-I score shows similar accuracy to the BBS scale in predicting future falls. However, there are still significant dropouts among these patients because their initial diagnosis was not made five years earlier."
30443720,"This study focuses on the association between phospholipids and markers of inflammation. In this study, we examine whether obesity alters the relationship between fasting plasma Adiponection concentration and levels of inflammation-related markers. We conclude that these markers are directly related to insulin-sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Furthermore, our cross sectional results suggest that adipogenin concentration is positively associated with increased blood pressure and body fat. The risk of developing CKD for overweight subjects is higher than that of those with monstrous weight. Twenty morbidally obese women participate in this prospect; they undergo short-term venous chemomies as well as an extended period of follow-up. These studies show that visceral fat may be involved in the process of atherosclerosis."

Iron-supplementations are effective in improving iron status in children with anemia, but they do not improve their mental and physical development. In rand and ommized double blinded trial, we assess the effect of daily iron on blood iron concentrations and growth in infants from low socioeconomic backgrounds in Turkey. The mean increase in height gain was not significant between the daily or weekly doses; however, weight gain did not differ among intervention groups. Hematology and behavior measurements were obtained before and after treatment. Children aged 5 to 10 years were assigned for a doubleblind study at the Children's Hospital in Colombo, Sri Lanka. They were divided into three different groups: iron-unsufficientmented, irondepleted, andiron-deficient Anemia group. Acute goiter epidemics were common among children who receive iron supplements than those who received either placebo or iron. This study also examined the effects of combined iron and zinc on iron levels and mineral status. There were neither significant differences among the two groups as they grow. No significant changes in hemoglobinal concentration during the treatment period. Although there were no significant variations in mean corpucular volume or values of erythroocyte porphyrein or serum ferritsin between treatment sets, these conclusions should now become confirmed with another intervention study to demonstrate that the benefits could only have come from varying sources of iron supply. Infants fed iron formulas had no negative affect on their growth. However, when iron supplementation increased haemolin concentration, it was more effective than other methods. It was concluded that ironfortified milk would be better because it contained iron than any other form of food."
32240516,"This is a first-in-man study evaluating the effects of cannabbinol on body weight in women with anorexic or bipolar disorder. It was found that both groups showed significant changes in their eating disorder-specific traits. The results suggest that there may be some alterations in the system of the canonabinoids, which could lead to pathophysiological consequences for these patients. In this paper, we examine the effect of ""dronabinOl"" on physical activity and investigate the role of its antiemetics in this process. We conclude that it is not possible to use 9thC alone in treatment of primary anxiety disorder because it causes significant psychological disturbance."
20429925,"In this paper, we describe the results of a three-year observational cohort study in which 632 newly hired workers were followed for 3 years. Gender, age, ethnicity, and prior pain history were associated with ""N/S M.S"" and ""M.D."" The Norwegian group reported less neck pain than the U. S. or the Norwegian groups. After the intervention, they reported mainly improvements in chair comfort, lighting conditions, visual strain,and sitting posture. A group consisting of routine entry operators was included in Polish MEPS. Musculoskeastic - eyestrain  -- psychosocial & stress. This study is based on standardized examinations that are used to diagnose and classify upper limb disorders. It also includes an investigation into the effects of workstation design on symptoms of shoulder, elbow, low back, headache, anxiety, fatigue, eye tension, nervousness, sleepwalking, moodiness, mental health, etc."

In healthy volunteers, this effect is more rapid than that seen with conventional antidespressants; however, it does not appear to be significant until after six weeks of treatment."
31013312,"Curcumin, a popular Indian spice, has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we investigate the effect on blood sugar in Type 2 diabetics by comparing curcumminin to placebo. The results suggest that it may be effective in preventing atheroscomatose disease in type 2 patients. This is based on an eight-week trial of 100 subjects with Type 1 diabetes who were assigned to either 300mg/day or placebo for three months. After the trial, all but one group showed significant improvement in their body weight and body mass index. They also showed improved sensitivity to Adipokines and reduced signs of retinitism in those treated with Meriva."
25887465,"In a series of studies, the power of adjusted analysis has been increased from 80 % to 92.6 percent across the 12 outcome measures. The most important outcome in this study is pain intensity and physical impairment for patients who have acute and sub-acute low back pain. Pregabalin was more effective than placebo in reducing pain but not long-term chronic pain after surgery. A double blinded follow-up study found no difference in pain scores or requests for breakthrough medicine at 48 hours. Fibromyalsia is characterized by wide, persistent pain; it affects between five and 70 %) of surgical patients depending on the operation. Postanesthesia care units pain score, 24 hour opioid requirements, time to analgesis, and pain scales were recorded at 1, 3, 6, 6 months later. After surgery, all patients presented evidence for nervous injury, manifesting primarily by needle wounds. Both groups received preoperative medication with 200mg/day of Amantadines followed by 200 Mg per eight hours for 14 days. This treatment did not improve postoperative pain either. However, both groups showed signs of improvement in their ability to control pain during the first three months after recovery. These results suggest that chronic postsurgery pain can be preventive. Although there are no commercially active treatments for these conditions, many patients remain reluctant to undergo any intervention. For example, one patient's fear of pain may lead him to avoid exercise. Another study uses the Short-Formed McGill Pain Question Questionnaire to predict pain severity among patients with diverse chronic painful syndromes as well as those with painful diobecious peripheral neuropathy. It also suggests that glutathone should be added to CDDP because it reduces the risk of toxic effects of Cisplatin. Herpes Zoster: Acute Neuritis and Persistent Pain Are the Most Significant Clinical manifestations of Herples Zoster and are Endpoints for clinical trials Therapy is used to prevent herpez zostea. There are two main end points: 1) shepezy disease is the most significant medical manifestation of herpels vs 2) severe nor incapacitateating pain are the major clinical manifestation"
27820060,"The aim of this study is to determine whether brief, short-term counseling by a nurse can be effective in preventing alcoholism in older adults. This paper describes the results of an eight-month observational trial on patients who had undergone bypass surgery and were not treated with conventional care. After six months, they improved their lifestyle habits but did not improve their risk factors for heart disease. In addition, smoking cessations were shown to be more effective than usual care in improving the risk factor profiles of patients with coronarry heart diseases. A pilot study was conducted on 277 women with suspected coronary thrombosis who were assigned to either control or intervention groups. Although both groups showed significant improvements in health status, no differences were found between the two groups; further studies are needed to identify how best to tailor these treatment plans to diverse racula, cultural, and age groupings."
25979719,"The relative risk of an event in a trial is calculated by assuming that the patient receives no treatment for the first time. If there are no significant changes in the risk after the initial treatment, then the absolute risk reduction is determined. In this paper, we use rtms to assess pain in patients with acute or chronic neuropathy. We compare the effects of these two treatments on pain severity and motor cortex function. Although some patients do not experience any pain at all, most patients report moderate or severe pain. This study suggests that although pain improvement may be temporary, it is important to achieve the desired state of pain before long-term treatment."
11034690,"In this study, we examine the effects of a total parental nutrition regimen on infants receiving only parenteral food. We find that in addition to improved growth and health, carnitol concentrations are reduced in both groups. The mean values of both carnictine and free fatty acid concentration were similar in the control group. However, there was an increased concentration of docosane in these two groups as well."
18347346,"Sixteen healthy men are divided in two groups. On energy expenditure, body composition and thyroid function, they receive either a placebo-controlled or recominant growth hormone treatment for 14 days. The results of the study indicate that GH is effective in suppressing exercise-induced endogenous secretion of circulating Isoforms; however, it does not improve total thryroxine levels. In adulthood, growth therapy increases bone dentility, but there is little evidence for its effects on other health-related conditions. A double blinded crossover study examines the effects of low-dose rhH on blood flow, heart rate, and body mass. Eight healthy subjects age 24 - 29 years were assigned to receive both gh/0.1 ml per day or placebo. After 28 days, eight healthy male subjects had no significant changes in their weight or body fat. They also did not show any change in leptiner levels nor in insulin-sensitivity."
29490085,"The effect of parathyroid Hormone on blood pressure and lipids in patients with Type 2 diabetes is studied. Partialcitole does not affect any of the markers of inflammation or oxidative stresses, except for Hba1c. In contrast, paracitol does improve some of these markers.

21412147,"A single two-gram dose of Ceftraxone for heart surgery is as effective a single dosing regimen as an ordinary multiple dose technique after 1502 procedures with short ABP, 131 site-sicknesses were recorded after 1139 surgeries with prolonged Abp. The results are quite similar in each group; with very low infection rates. In this study, we compare the effect on short and long-hour acute-brain pressures by surgical site infection. Short-barrel wound infections occurred in both groups but no significant difference was seen between the two groups. This study supports the apothecary's claim that ceftrioxon prophylaxes should be used during major surgery. No advantage exists byextending this treatment beyond the time of surgery End time for only 40.2% of patients."
16856043,"In this study, we assess the efficaciousness of a new antipsychotic drug in patients with severe bipolar disorder. The subjects receive six weeks of either olanzepine or halopridol; they are followed for one year up to double blinded maintenance therapy. This trial is aimed at comparing the safety and effectiveness of two different drugs in treating acutely ill menic patients. Both regimens produce significant improvements in manic symptoms but do not lead to significant changes in quality of life. Bipolar affectives have considerable implications for personal andsocial functioning. A doubleblind, prospective, cross-sectional study consists of 40 newly admitted patients who receive either HaloperidoroL or flupentxosol. After 6 weeks, both regimen improves without any significant differences in outcome. No unexpected side effects occur. All patients receive prophylent benztropines. Manic treatment is divided into three groups: 1) carbamazine pine plus lithium/Hal-Li; 2) haloperoidplus lithium -- HAL-LI; and 3) CBZ Plus Li. At week 6, there is no significant change in five dimensions on the Medical OutComes Study Quick Form Health Survey. There is little difference in health status between the two groups except for some minor sideeffects. Rispurdone reduces the severity of BPMD scores by as much as 0.5mg per day."

29510813,"In this paper, the Danish authorities approve of a trial using an ""electronic selfmonitoring"" program to improve patients' quality of care. The results show that the intervention reduces the mean level and time with significant manic symptoms by 19.2 weeks vs. 24.7 weeks in the control group. This study is intended to advance the use of short-message technology for improving patient health. It has been reported that some studies have used short message services to aid in weight loss or maintenance. However, these methods are not as effective as those used in other types of mental illness. Bipolar disorder is one of the most severe psychological disorders in Denmark."
30231505,"In this study, we report the results of a double-blinded trial of LacTobacillus Rhamnosus G in infants with eczyma. At two years of age, the risk of developing an infection was reduced in comparison to that of children receiving placebo. The efficacy of probiotic treatment is questioned because of the high frequency of these diseases and the lack of evidence for the value of anti-atopic irritated immune responses. We conclude that proicrobials can be used as preventive measures against these disease-causing conditions since they are easily absorbed by pregnant women and have been proposed as safe and effective treatments for their use."
31494864,"This study focuses on the effects of two different types of physical activity on blood pressure and body composition among cleaners. The first group is aerobic exercise, while the second group uses a combination of strength training and stretching to improve health-related qualities of life. After six months, the results are similar for both groups. Age and gender vary widely in terms of their scores on various measures of fitness. In particular, females show higher scores than males on muscle strength and endurance. These results suggest that worksite exercises may be effective in reducing pain and improving overall health."
29372708,"In this study, the effects of a fluoride-filled filling on teeth is investigated. The results indicate that Fissurings sealant significantly reduces the risks of caries when compared with conventional sealants.

27116227,"This study consists of a population-based, age-matched cohort of nondibetic men or women. The results indicate that there is an inverse association between the levels of 25-hydroxyvinculose and future glucemia in terms of risk for hyperglycia and insulin resistance. In contrast, the values of blood pressure and fasting glucose are greater in men than women; they vary with season. These results suggest that high-dose vitamin D may be beneficial for people at risk of developing Type I and Type II diabetes. A doubleblind, rand and omolized control study was used to determine whether higher doses of Vitamin D for one year affected Insulin Secretion, Insulsensitivity, and the Development of Diabetes. It was found that subjects with pridiabetes and low-vitaminoses were more likely to develop Type 1 disease than those with normal blood sugar. Furthermore, it was concluded that patients with elevated blood fat could be better matched to their type I condition. Thus, this study included both case-control and random samples of 1,500 IU/ day of daily supplementation. Although no significant changes were observed in cardiovascular disease markers, these studies did not lead to improved outcomes. Therefore, we performed another trial on overweight and obese individuals who received either 3,000 mL of single-blinded vitaminD or placebo. Both groups showed marked improvements in body mass and visceal fat area. However, neither group had any significant differences in other measures of health. Finally, all three groups completed the trial. After eighty-one percent of the participants complete the trials, 85 % of them from the calcium plus D group versus 78 p."
30338526,"In this study, we examine the effect of an extensively hydrozed formula on infants at risk of asthma. The results suggest that early exposure to cow's milk in breast-fed children does not lead to atopic illness in the first two years. We also find that the shorter time for gastric transit time is significantly lower in both groups. Atopy disease is found in 13% of the control group but only in 29% of those who receive the partially-hyrized formula. This study furthermore suggests that there is no significant difference between weight gain and height or behavior development at three or five years of age. Although growth and tolerance are evaluated, it is evident that different formulas may tolerate each other differently."

The results suggested that DFC and Prune in equal antiinflammatory dosage are equally effective in slowingdown the decline of muscular strength in Dmd; '""benefits outweightheside effects"". Only weight gain is seen in the group receiving prednistone at 0.5mg/kg. Prednicone improves muscle strength but does not lead to significant changes in performance."
28410504,"In this study, we examine the effects that a single dose of morphine has on the vasodinatric response in patients with chronic low-back pain. We conclude that exercise is associated with reduced risk of injury and that it is beneficial for older adults to engage in regular physical activity."
29990473,"The effects of a high-fat, low-sugar diet on weight loss in patients with Type 2 diabetes are investigated. In the control group, no significant changes were observed in body mass index or concentrations of blood fat and triumvirate. A double-blindend, placebo-control study was conducted to evaluate the effect of an alpha lipoic acid regimen on body weight change in obese subjects. After two weeks, there was marked improvement in both body size and total cholesterol levels. Alphalipoc acid improved endothelusal dysfunction in rats treated with rat's high fat diet. Furthermore, this treatment reduced AST, ALT, GGT value and improved Nfld fibrosus score. This study is designed to investigate the efficaciousness of alpilic acid in treating type 2 diabetic patients."
24370176,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether mild, severe growth restriction during birth is associated with the risk of minor and serious behavior problems at 5 yrs. age and school performances at 8  years of age. A prospective cohort of 1298 preterm children was studied from birth through 15 years. All of the children had major health issues before or immediately after birth, and all were discharged within 7 days. At 4 - 12 years old, motor outcomes were assessed by the gross motor function classification system and the manual ability classifice system. Brain lesions were similar for both groups. In addition, there were no significant differences in the severity of symptoms between early-preterm infants and full- term children. Preterm babies showed better performance on tests of intelligence, reading, spelling, immature skills, as well as social information than their peers who were born very prematurely."
26061331,"The European guidelines for anemia treatment recommend that patients receive iron sucrose or a combination of it. In this study, we report the safety and effectiveness of two different forms of iron therapy in patients with mild to moderate IBD: 1) combined iron-supplemented FeS; and 2) single-dose iron dextrase. This study is designed to determine whether either regimen will improve symptoms in acutely ill patients who have heart failure, reduced left ventrination fraction, and irondeficiency. It was found that both regimens had similar rates of death, adverse events, as well as serious adverse effects. However, there were no significant differences in the severity of the outcome between the two groups. A total group received one dose of ferric caroxymaltol at 7m iron/g body weight, followed by 5 200mg infusions during the following 5 weeks. Both studies reported favorable safety results. Iron deficitiencies may impair athletic performance. The Intrvenous Group received '1500 mg iron sisfate' of 7 M iron equivalent to 100 M elemental iron. After 2 years, these patients showed improved blood levels. They also experienced less than expected complications. These included fever, nausea, hypotension, swelling, chest pain, headache, cardiac arrest, myalgy, etc. Ferric carboxymoltosis was used as hepardized iron in severe bowel disease such as Crohn's disease."

In addition, there are no significant differences in the changes in trunk extension between the control group and the intervention group. The primary outcome for this study is improvements in back pain and physical function after nine months of resistance training. However, it is not possible to predict whether these changes will be permanent or temporary. Other studies have shown that long-term exercises can reduce fractures in elderly people. A recent trial has found that balance and strengthtraining may reduce the risk of falls among older people with recurrent low-thirsty fracture"
15789890,"This study focuses on the validity of multiple outcome measures for patients with recurrent rheusatoidin arthritis. It compares the patient-centered health assessment question, the pain score, and three quality-of- life measures collected from 100 patients who had undergone total joint surgery. The results suggest that the use of these measures can be useful in determining relative efficacy of different treatment regimens. In addition, it is used to assess changes in pain, stiffness, fatigue, anxiety, as well As an alternative method for calculating change scores for disease status questions, transitional surveys have been developed. These surveys are highly correlated with one another but do not reveal any significant differences in severity or degree of change."
21154394,"In this study, the authors describe a double blinded, parallel- group, flexible dose, placebo-control study of quetitiapine augmentation in patients who had not received adequate treatment with an open- label treatment. They conclude that it may be useful for OCD patients to add low-dose quitia pine to their regimen as it improves their mood and behavior. Sixteen patients are enrolled and twelve completed the study. According to Hamilton Rating scale for depression, severity of depressed mood, and the profile of Moodas States, ristonian but not  Halo-peridone, also improved despondent mood. Conclusions This results suggest that obsessolate-compulsed disorder can respond to addition of low dosage respiratory medication to ongoing serotonein reabsorption inhibitors. Thirt thirty-six adult patients with primary DSMIV diagnosis were treated with 12 weeks of SRI therapy. After six weeks, subjects received differing dosages depending on the response. A mean SD decrease in the Yale-brown Obsessionsive Comppulsives Score was calculated; however, no significant difference was found between the two groups. The objective is to evaluate theefficacy of qutitapane added to standard antipsychotic treatment in severely illiterate adults. Twenty-three patients aged between 18. and 65 years met DPMIV criteria for Opsesive-Complesively disorder, who did not respond either to or to any of the other treatments. For 6 weeks they were divided into two different groups: one group consisted of 24 subjects who were judged by resistance to the first treatment and another group comprised only 28 subjects. Both groups responded without significant differences. Although no differences emerged from the proportion of patient reporting at least adverse experiences, being rash associated with Amenorrhaea and/or olanzepines with weight gain, there were few studies on whether these agents could be used over the long course of time."
31745834,"In this study, we examine the long-term outcome of patients with acute atrial fibrillation who receive either a rate control strategy or an anticoagulant regimen. We conclude that although both strategies may lead to better outcomes than one another, they are not superior to each other in terms of their potential for reducing the risk of stroke, heart failure, and mortality."
31766052,"In the United States, a trial of annual breast mammography is underway. Women in the intervention arms receive more than 160 921 eligible women who are invited to participate in this study. The results show that DBT has the ability to reduce the burden of conventional mamography by reducing the amount of time required for image acquisition and screen reading. However, there is no significant difference in size or node status between those who undergo D1D and those whom underwent SM. Furthermore, the rate of interval breastcancers was higher with D2D than with 2D Mammograph alone. This study also compares the performance of ""two-dimensional"" mastography with two-dimenary mastographies. It shows that it can be used as an alternative to traditional mamillography when combined with ""stand and ard 3D."""
20655610,"This pilot study compares the effects of an edited diabetes prevention program to brief counseling in adults who attend a risk assessment event at two semi- urban ymca facilities. The results indicate that the intervention group has greater reductions in total cholesterol and body weight than the usual control group. In addition, the case management groups have fewer changes in Hba1c levels as compared to the normal care group; however, they are more likely to be women or of nonwhite races. A total number of 67 subjects with Type 2 diabetes were rand and ommized into usual care and casemanagement groups. After 1 year, weight loss was 4.6  5.4 vs 1.87 p..001. These results suggest that lifestyle changes cannot be solely explained by the reduction in body size. However, there is still some evidence that this type of lifestyle change can prevent Type 2, especially when combined with exercise. There are 107 cases of Diabetes during the 4.0-year followup period. Although these patients had improved their health after the first year of the trial, it is not yet clear whether the effect of activity on blood sugar is due to increased physical activity or because of poor diet."
28178949,"In this study, the effects of morphine on depressed patients are investigated. The results suggest that it is possible to improve depressive symptoms by using an extended-release form of the drug. A double blinded, parallel-controlled trial was performed in which a group of patients received either quetiamine XR or sertraline for six weeks. After two weeks, both groups showed significant improvement in their depression scores. They also demonstrated greater improvements in sleep and behavior than did placebo. This study compares the efficaciousness of paroixetine, imipramin, and fluvocxamine with those of other antidepressents. Both were superior to placebo in terms of changes in Hamilton Depression Rating Score; however, they were not different from placebo at all."

24082796,"This paper focuses on the effects of stimulants in children with hyperactivity disorder. The effect of a combination of short-acting methylmethi date and attention-defit/hypteractivity disease is shown to be more effective than either treatment alone or with attention control. Children who receive this treatment have improved their academic performance, social skills, and behavior over two years. In addition, they have reduced the risk of developing antisocial behavior by maintaining an active form of attention deficitor disorder at age 8 years; furthermore, these children are less likely to develop drug abuse. A prospective long-term follow-up analysis of 100 boys with ADHD shows that there is no evidence for longer term improvement in educational, occupational, economic, mental health, or social outcomes. For example, when combined with parent training, children show greater improvements in self-rated parenting behavior than those treated only with medication. Furthermore, parents report better knowledge of how to treat children's symptoms. These results suggest that early intervention may be needed rather than waiting until adulthood as many patients with both types of disorder do."
27153869,"In older adults with mild to moderate forms of dementia, physical activity is associated with improved performance on the Rey's 'Auditory verbal learning test.

29728079,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights focuses on the association between weight loss and tooth loss among older adults in Swedish. The authors examine whether eating quickly is associated with increased risk of being overly obese. They conclude that young men who eat quickly are more likely to become overweight than those who do not. This study furthermore investigates the relationship between body mass index--a measure of how much an individual's body changes over time-and waist circumference --as a predictor of future health."
24876777,"In this study, we examine the effect of a novel antipsychotic on patients with early stage schizophrenia. We find that compared to haloperiddol, olazapine, and quetita pine treatment, both have significant improvements in neurococognition. The results are similar to those reported in previous studies; however, some patients switch their initially prescribed drug at three years' time. This study is an attempt to investigate the relationship between changes in selfreported quality-of life among Chinese subjects with schizophrenia who switched from conventional antipsyotics during usual out patient care. Pearson's Correlation coefficients were used as measures of the correlation betweenchange in symptoms and change in health-related qualities of life within Chinese patients who were switched by their initial antipolotic medication. A multi-centre, double- blinded, parallel-gave observational study was designed to compare efficacy, safety,and associated resource use for Olanzapane and Risperidone across Australia, New Zeal, or Taiwan. Both groups showed significant improvement in general and attentiondomains but not much more than that seen with other treatments. At twelve months, treated patients showed significantly improved in all eight domains of short form health surveys: Short form Health Survey, Medical Outcomers Study 36-item Short Form Heath Survey, General Assessment Score, Gross and ADL Score All P-Values.0001. Metamorphisms still remain unconvinced about the relative effects of second- generation antipolitic drugs on quality of lives and psychosocial functions in patients suffering from early-stage disorder."
17943911,"Probiotic Lactobacteria reduces the severity of asymptomatic children with moderate- and severe disease. In infants, probiotic Lreuteri increases the amount of intestinal feccal bIfido bacteria in the gut by increasing the number of different strains of these organisms. The results suggest that this treatment may be beneficial in improving symptoms of acute earaches during the first two years of life. Infants receiving probiota are more likely to have improved symptoms than mothers who receive placebo. Atopic ecrozema is reduced in at risk children after perinatal administration of lactobacilus rhumnosus strain VIII-003, which has been shown to reduce the frequency of outbreaks from birth until adulthood."
21920661,"In this paper, we describe the efficaciousness of a single-drug treatment for patients with ""interstitial cystits"" who have failed stoic therapy in open trials. The results are quite promising: patient satisfaction is significantly improved after four weeks of treatment and the problem score improves from 11.3 to 6.1. A reduction in symptoms is associated with significant improvement in satisfaction with Pentosansan polysulphate sodium; however, when compared with other responders, subjects gaining an additional 30 % reduction were more likely pleased with Pss for their ic symptoms than those not receiving it. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of three different drugs in treating interspertial Cysitis. These include pentosolous sodium, intravesical chloride, and botulinium toxin. Although these studies did not prove to be highly effective, they do demonstrate that they can be used as stand-alone treatments."
31405892,"Eight patients with severe vitaminD deficiencies sustained fractures in one of the placebo groups. The group received a higher concentration of 1hydroxyvitamind 3, which reduced bone mineral density in the second Metacarpals. A post-hoc analysis showed that there was no difference at all in changes in muscle strength between the two treatment groups; however, they did not show any significant differences in improvement in other measures of physical function. In this study, we examined whether daily high-dose Vitamin D could prevent or delay death among older people who are living in an institution. We concluded that daily doses of 1,500 IU were sufficient to reduce mortality in those with advanced heart failure but were associated with greater needs for MCS devices. Furthermore, our results suggest that increased vitamin D consumption may preserve or improve Bone Mineral Densities in older persons. This trial compares three different forms of therapy: 1) long-term Calcium Carbonate, 2) short-lived calcium citrate, and 3) single-monthly ergocaliferol. These regimens do not lead to falls over five months. However, their effect on bone turnover does not seem to have any bearing on the risk of falling. They also report that parathyroid Hormone decreases significantly when they are given 1,000 hyd per day. Another study investigates whether regular daily use of 500 mg of alpha-hydroxyvindol would reduce the rate of hip fracture by elderly people in hospital. After 10 months, 64 subjects had one or less nonvertebrol fracture while 51 had fewer than 100 controls. There was little difference in injury or number of falls in either group. Two independent studies investigated whether weekly or monthly IVD supplementation could reduce fallers and injuries in elderly women. Both groups reported no change in ankle and leg strength. Although both groups experienced slight increases in blood pressure, neither group improved it during the first six months of treatment."

Forty-three iron-dpleted women were assigned to receive 50mg FeSO or a single placebo twice daily in r and Omized trial. The results suggest that iron deficiencies without anemic can be corrected by iron supplementation. In addition, the use of zinc-containing iron improves blood ferritin as well as zinc absorption. A double blinded trial was conducted on forty-one un trained women who received either 50 mill Ferrous Sulfate or another placebo two daily for six wk. This study showed that there was no group difference in baseline iron condition or in 15 mile time. Conclusions Our findings strongly suggests thatiron deficion withoutanemia but with increased sTTfR status Impairs aerobic adaptability among previously untraining women and that it can easily be adjusted with iron supplements. For forty one unattended women, iron depletement did not interfere with their ability to perform vigorous exercise. They were divided into two groups: zinc/supplemented; iron supplied,n = 12, n= 12. After treatment, fatigue declined by 1.8 at the iron group while not within the placebo group P = 0.001, p '.005."
24367612,"This paper focuses on the risk factors of hospitalized surgical site infection in children preparing for surgery. It uses a case control study to identify predictors that are independent of disease severity and patient age. In addition, this study identified several independently predicted risk factor for patients with syphilis who had been treated during their follow-up period. These included: obesity, chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and class of woundcontaminated or dirty wounds. A case-control survey was conducted at an infection control center where the length of stay, preoperative time, antibiotic profectus, drainage, ASA Score, etc. were determined. The incidence of surgicalsite infection was 6.3 percent among adults; there were no significant differences between the rate of infection caused by methicillin resistance and the frequency of outbreaks due to other pathogens such as Staphyllococcus Aureus. Thus, the purpose of this report is to determine the incident and riskfactors associated with the developing ofsurgical site infections using the national nosocomic infection surveillance system risk index. There were 35 cases of superficial incisionals and 18 weremediastinits for incidence rates up to 1.6 p..1 %. Therefore, it is important to investigate the risks of these complications in order to better understand how they can be prevented."
26629535,"The authors report that lurissadone, an antipsychotic drug, significantly reduces the severity of major depressive symptoms in patients with Bipolar disorder. In addition, it has been reported that bipolar patients spend more time ill than other people. This is due to their greater frequency of depression and multiple anxiety disorders. A recent study suggests that there may be a significant relationship between anxiety and mood disturbances in individuals with bipoloism. For example, women who have rapid cycling or anxiety are more likely to develop depression than those who do not experience these symptoms. However, this does not account for the negative effects of anxiety on mental health."
25644019,"In this study, we compared the effects of iron therapy on patients with mild to moderate anemia. The mean change in haemologlobin concentrations was not significant for both groups. A total hip and Knee replacement arthrostry were performed. Both groups had similar levels of haermogloin. Iron was more effective than either group in treating anaemia but no serious adverse events occurred. This study compares the effect of IV iron sugrose as well as oral iron treatment in patients who had severe an acute disease. It showed that there was no difference in peak vo2 between the two treatments. However, it was found that the daily iron content was higher than recommended by the national academy of science. Hemogen levels were measured after surgery. There was little difference when treated with iron or ferrous sisfate. Adverse reactions occurred in six out of thirty-two patients."
26323052,"In this paper, we present the results of a study using the Post-traumatic stress disorder checklist to assess the performance of an instrument used to screen patients for PTSD. We conclude that the score of 45- 50 is the best cut score for distinguishing cases from noncases in this setting. Furthermore, our study suggests that it may be useful as an early warning tool for mothers of childhood wounds who have been receiving treatment for their disease. This paper also discusses the use of the Psychiatric Diagnostic Accurate Score as compared to the telephone and structured clinical interview for DSMIV. It shows that veterans with combat stress reactions are more likely to report symptoms of post trauma than those without them."
24362925,"In this paper, the effects of exercise on pain, sleep, fatigue, and tender point count in patients with Fibromya are examined. The results suggest that pyridtigmine, an anti-inflammatory drug, can be used as a preventative measure against relapses. A multi-disciplinary treatment program is presented for female patients who have fibromyalsgia. They receive regular physical activity and stretching exercises to improve their symptoms. After eight months of training, they show significant improvement in pain severity, function, pain interference, depression, anxiety, quality of living, etc. Six months later, improvements are seen in both groups. Women with fagitalgy are assigned to either group of two groups: one group consisting of ""tai"" chi or another group composed of relaxation/treatching exercises. This study compares the benefits of six-week traditional exercise programs with those of water-based exercise. Both groups produce improved pain scores but no difference in intensity between groups; however, there is some reduction in FIQ score. Finally, several studies attempt to determine whether exercise will improve health status in people suffering from rheuumatology. These studies include swimming, pool exercise, self-effacement, mental health, mood changes, strength training among women with heroism."
30622734,"This is a prospective, observational study of the effect of daily exercise on patients with hip arthrosis. At 6 months, the mean difference between controls and educational groups was 0.32; 95 %confidence interval. The results were similar to those obtained in other studies. In this study, all patients attended three patient education meetings led by two physical therapist's. A total pain score was measured at six months after the intervention. There was no significant change in disease activity or quality of life for both groups. Another study examined the effects that strength training had on muscle strength and function in people with knee ostearthrits. It was found that resistance training improved range of motion but did not improve health status. These studies are further described in another paper."
18418399,"In this paper, we describe the use of sublingual nicopurl and nidipine in treating hypertension in patients with an acute myosmodynamic crisis. Both drugs reduce blood pressure effectively but do not cause significant side effects. We compare two different methods for treating these patients: 1) using nitroprusolside as a first-line treatment and 2) using captopriL as an alternative. The results suggest that both drugs can be used to treat severe hypertensives. A double blind study comparing the efficaciousness of either drug regimen is performed. At 45 minutes after administration, theblood pressure fell significantly from 216-0/117.4) mmHhg to 1710.0/93.4 mpg under nizophrylate and from 215.9/117.2 mph to 177.00/94 pg Hg Under Nifedipin. There were no significant differences in time-dependent changes between the two groups. Two studies are conducted; one on open label control and another on doubleblind controlled trials. They conclude that they are safe and effective at rapidly lowering diastolic or syphilisal emergencies. After 5, 10, 15, 20 & 30 min, respectively, there was no change in heart rate. Blood pressure fall within 60 min in the NTT/NAC group. This suggests that it is possible to have more rapid improvement by adding NTG/NCA to the initial treatment of acute pulsive emergencies because of its spasmodic effect on brain vessels."
22232096,"The results of this study suggest that behavior therapy can be used as a preventative measure against type 2 diabetes in patients who are overweight. Although initial weight loss does not predict long-term or short- term weight losses, it is believed that people who reach their goal of losing weight lose more quickly than those who do not. A description of two pilot studies describes the potential for further use of the new training program to spread across the United States. However, there is no national model for spreading the DPP message on an American population. In these studies, subjects with low blood sugar levels develop Type 2 and receive detailed instructions on how to lose weight through physical activity and diet. This intervention reduces the risk of developing Type 1 by nearly half."
29465026,"In this study, we examine the effects of a single-blinded placebo-controlled regimen on depression in Japanese and Korea patients. The results indicate that both depressive symptoms or alcohol consumption decrease significantly over time in either group. Both treatment groups are well tolerated; however, there are some drawbacks: the severity of the adverse events is greater in the sertraline-only group than with the other treatments. A double blinded parallel study was designed to confirm the performance of nobility in antidepressants for patients with chronic depression. This trial showed that paroxentine improved by reducing the frequency of severe side effects as well as by improving the Hamilton Depression Rating Score. It also demonstrated that imipramine was more effective than bupropion in treating major depressed patients because it had fewer side effect effects. Agomeltone was superior to paroxetine in elderly patients suffering from Major Depressive disorder."
29211740,"In this chapter, we present the results of an r and Omized control trial of a social communication intervention for young children in the early stages of their childhood. We report that there is significant short-term effect on targeted social communicative skills; however, no effects are detected on language orglobal ratings of social function and communication. A Japanese pilot study of ""treatment and education of autistic and related communication"" for children with high-familiarity was conducted. The program included comprehensive group intervention, which featured weekly two-hour sessions totaling 20 session over six months. Parents perceived considerable improvement in their child's language, social interaction, and their personal stress level. Children with Autism showed significant deficits during imitation skills. Recipropal Imitation training, RIT, was designed to teach youngchildren with autism to mimic during play. These studies suggest that early intervention may be more effective than conventional approaches because it can lead to improved joint attention and behavior. Early intervention has been especially successful in improving language and adaptive functions in school. However, many trials have failed to show any positive effects on quality of joints attention. For example, several studies have found that imitation training is better at facilitating shared positive affect between children and adults than playing alone. This paper also discusses the use of music therapy as an early treatment for infants with severe delusions of autism. It reports that parents who attend public schools receive more time to practice their parenting skills than do those who go directly to community centers. Prelinguistic core deficiencies in children under the auspices of classical autism are often neglected by evidence-based practices. Most importantly, these studies provide evidence for ""plasticity of these development systems in younger children."""
28474733,"A prospective, open-labeled study of a combination treatment of lamotripine and risperdone in patients with bipolar I who have failed multiple antidepressants. The results are favorable for the first time since the previous two trials. In this case, there is no significant change in symptoms during the initial six weeks of treatment; however, after four weeks, both groups show marked improvement in Young Manis Rating Scores. Lithium does not appear to be superior as maintenance treatment among youths who stable on combination Liv+/Drivpx pharmacotherapies."""
31616340,"In this paper, we examine the effects of a high-fat diet on age-related brain decline. We find that fish consumption is associated with slower weight loss than lean individuals; however, there is no association between body mass index and executive function. The results of mixed-effects modeling indicate that the Crad-O group has pronounced improvements in their ability to control their weight over three months compared to controls. This suggests that it may be possible for patients to improve their health by altering their eating habits rather than persist through an unhealthy choice. Brain scans suggest that children with obesity have greater executive functions than those who do not."
26449638,"This paper reports on the results of a systematic review of studies regarding the use of glass-Ionomers cements in the treatment of tooth caries. It was found that there were significant gaps in trial performance between published studies and uncontrolled trials. The most commonly reasons for these gaps were lack of adequate trials, absence of sufficient random samples, and an attrition risk. A total of eight96 cited articles were identified from the literature. Pain during restorative treatments is common among patients who do not have regular or regular brushing. An alternative technique called ""art"" uses only hands and instruments to treat the patient's pain."
16530201,"In this study, we examine the effects of fish oil on blood pressure in patients who have had a successful coronary surgery. The results are similar to those seen in other studies; however, there is no significant difference in the levels of total cholesterol or lipophospholipids between women and men. Furthermore, both groups seem to have an effect on monocyte function. A high-dose concentrate of ethilester concentrate has been used for several years to treat acute myomyocardial disease. This concentrate reduces the risk of heart attack and may improveprognosis. However, it does not affect long-term changes in body mass index. Women receive 20 g fatseed oil daily for four weeks. They increase their breast milk, plasma, and rythrocyte content. Fatshex seed oil also increases celluloprotein concentration but decreases HDLcholesterol. There is little change in fasting, phospholipinic acid, triacylgluceride, or LDLcholestrol as compared with corn oil. Both groups show increased reductions in serum phosphatilic acid level. These results suggest that alpha-laminolenic acids might be beneficial in treating hypertensies."
24585482,"In this paper, the authors describe a study in which they examine the incidence and risk factors of gallstones among women belonging to an isolated rural population. The results suggest that ""conventional information"" from the attending surgeon is inadequate. A multi-media health education program is used to improve patient knowledge about elective laparoscopiccholecychstectomy for patients with acute cholestotic disease. Preoperatively informed consent is required prior to surgery. This educational program reduces pain and nausea by reducing anxiety and improving patient recall."
27765009,"The purpose of this study is to determine the frequency and severity of patients' self-reports of anxiety. Those with more than five annual visits are nearly four times as likely to have negative results for anxiety as those with less than one annual visit. Most tests fail to diagnose anxiety, but most do not yield significant clinical diagnoses. In this paper, we examine the relationship between blood test results and fatigue in general practice. We aim to explore the effect of postponed ordering of blood tests on this relationship. Aim To investigate the relation between established diagnoseses and the onset of abnormal bloodtest results among patients suffering from chronic fatigue. This study was conducted at an outpatient medical practice in London. It was found that fatigue was frequently associated with psychological causes. However, there were no clear somatic pathologies; only psychological problems. Thus, fatigue could be a cause for many patients."
25003202,"The purpose of the present study is to determine whether there is any difference in hip scores at three, six, and 12 months after total hiparthroplasty versus resurfacing. A multi-centre rand and ommized controlled trial will be performed. In this study, patients are randomized to receive either cementless or cross-linked Polyethylene bearings. After five years, the results show no significant differences between the two groups. For example, when comparing cemented with cementfree stems, it is found that the ceramic bearing has a higher rate of fracture than the metal bearing. When compared to conventional polyethylene, however, they have similar long term outcomes."
25978537,"In this paper, the effects of active-video games on weight, body composition, physical activity, and physical health are examined. The intervention group has a significant reduction in bodyfat compared to the control group. This is an evidence-based program that uses active video games to improve physical fitness and reduce body fat. It was also shown that overweight African American children who were not participating in the study had better performance in short-term executive function skills after 10 weeks of the program. These results suggest that action intentions may be important components of successful interventions to increase fruit and vegetable consumption in pre-Adolescence."
18334813,"The revised Consolr statement is based on new evidence and address some criticisms. It uses the terms ""manual muscle testing"" or ""hand-muscle test"" to assess the reliability of manual muscular testing in controlled trials. In this paper, Anderson reviews the results of several studies that use the technique of hand-milding to identify patients with sensitivity to both material types. These studies confirm Anderson's working hypothesis that using hands-masking will lead to improved patient health. Outcome Measures A pilot study investigates whether applied kinsiology can be used to predict food sensitivity in hypersensitive subjects. Thirteen subjects are found positive on these tests for food allergy. Seventeen other subjects show weakening or inhibiting reactions to one or two food items. This study further examines the effect of manipulating movements by using brain Gym exercises to improve response time."
31118956,"In a doubleblind, randozed placebo-controlled trial, Wuthering Heights and B420 showed significant reductions in body weight, body fat Mass, and abdominal circumference in the two groups. The results suggest that the weight loss diet and Probiotic Yogurt have synergy effects on T cell subset specific genes in Pbmcs, fat percentage, as well as body mass among overweight and obesity individuals. Both groups receive an appropriate dietary prescription; however, they do not show any significant changes in their body composition or other body-related characteristics. A probiotic strain called Lactobacilus JBD 30l appears to be more effective at preventing or reducing weight than either of the other anti-obesities approaches."
25086121,"The aim of this study is to determine whether patients with mild varus have better functional and pain-free outcomes if the knee, limb, and torso are aligned in a specific normal range. In these groups, there is no difference in the function or the incidence of fatal failure when the sagittal, coronal, or tial component rotations are in an appropriate range; outliers, as well as alignment of the entire body at different degrees of eccentricity. This study also compares the accuracy of patient-specified instrumentation to that of conventional instruments. It is found that the precision of individual component positioning is improved by using cutting guides, which improve the consistency of surgical time."

20921070,"In this paper, the authors describe a method for triageing children in order to determine whether observational pain scores can be used as an assessment of pain. They conclude that there are no differences in ratings due to age, gender, and site of study; however, they do note that cuddling is more effective when risk is higher. The levelof pain measured by either method is lower in the hospital than by the self- report or observationals. Children's pain score does not vary greatly with levels of risk, but their time to calm is reduced as risk increases. Methods include: ""Nausea, vomiting, painful"" and ""mild pain"" were common complications after surgical procedures in children. Amethocaine cream and lidocasic solution were used on children who had strabbing surgery. An open label study was performed on all children between 5 and16 years of age. All patients were asked whether their acute pain was mild, moderate, or severe. After analgesick administration was rated according to severity, both groups showed significant reductions in pain intensities at response to Opioids. Twenty children aged 5 to 16 years were assigned to two different conditions: 1) venous distraction using Street Lige, presented via head mounted display, nor 2) stand and arduous care, topical anesthesis with no distraction. Both methods reported significantly greater pain during the first day postoperatively. Sixteen children requiring Dermatological Procedures were enrolled. Iontophoris was applied for 13 minutes before IVcannulation, while Elitemax was application for 30 minutes prior to IVCANNulation. This study shows that use of epitophoresis has been shown to be safe and efficacious in treating pain associated with minor injuries. It also suggests that young patients can learn how to use hypnotis without being taught. These studies demonstrate that songs and musicians have benefited from reducing pain before, during, then after blood tests. Two other studies examine the effect of fingersticks on pain intensity following venipunculture. Preparations for wound infiltration are discussed. Postoperative treatment is divided into three groups: one group receives morphine, another gives paracetamin, third uses EMLA spray. Parents play picture games about pain and anxiety over the course of the procedure. There is no difference in patient satisfaction regarding pain management. However, parents prefer the"
22972106,"This study focuses on the effect of glucose-intake potassium on patients with severe hyperglyciaemia. The results suggest that this therapy may be more effective than conventional subcutaneous infusion, as it reduces the risk of major complications and improves blood glucose control. In addition, these two groups have shorter lengths of hospitalization than those in the other group. A new open-loop approach to perfusion has been proposed for children who are receiving mechanical ventilation during their surgery. It is reported that aggressive gycemic control will result in less morbidities than moderate or no-GiK treatment. However, there are no significant differences between the two approaches. After an initial period of observation, all patients were assigned either to receive intense insulin therapy or conventional Insulin therapy. There was not a significant difference in patient characteristics at pre-operative time; however, several patients had severe hypogliescemia events. Both groups showed improved survival after heart surgery due to reduced levels of proinflammatory cell activity. They also found that continuous insulin administration increased the rate of death from coronary arteries bypassed by grafting. These studies furthermore revealed that frequent intermittent subcuticular insulin injections could prevent deep wound infection following open heart procedures. Furthermore, they demonstrated that intensified insulin regimens can significantly reduce the severity of myomyocardial scarlet disease."
11405989,"In this paper, we examine the effects of extended iron therapy on infants with mild iron-dose anemia. Anestemia is associated with poor motor and mental development in these children. Although there are no significant differences between anaemia and other iron deficient groups in birth history, social status, or general nutrition, it is not clear whether a reduction in iron levels is due to lack of iron or because of some reason. Iron depletion has also been thought to affect central nervous system development, but little is known about its effect on human development."

The results suggest that both regimens are effective in reducing the risk of future strokes. In particular, Strength improves walking distance and gait velocity by 17 p.m., while Aerobic only improved measures of heart function. This is an important finding because it suggests that there may be a role for physical activity in stroke treatment. Furthermore, this study shows that ""through an integrated systems of education, advice and supports to both patient-and GP. the ICAruss model was effective as modifying various vascular risk factor and therefore should reduce the likelihood or repeat stroke or venous event."""

Morbidness was lower in this group than in the control group; 14.8 p..13%. This is significant because it suggests that patients with ERAS may be less likely to have complications after colorectinal surgery. The results of this trial suggest that multimodal rehabilitation can reduce postoperative morbidity and improve patient satisfaction. In addition, there is no difference in readmission or complications between the two groups."

This study compares the effect of an intervention by a trained American health worker to that of 'tele-assent physician appointments' on blood control among persons who have elevated blood levels at health fairies. A follow-up frequency of 85 % is achieved after four months. Changes are measured at six and 12 months, including changes in glycositylated hemogloin levels, bloodpressure, weight, body massindex, self-Reported  diet and physical activity pattern, and psychologically related measures such as diabetes distress, empowerment, depression, Self-care, medication fidelity, life satisfaction, quality of Life, etc. In this study, we examine the effects of ""culturely-tailoured lifestyle intervention"" on uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes in rural African Americans with low glycemia. After two weeks, both groups improved their scores but did not achieve significant reductions in haemoglobin level. These results suggest that there may be some risk of future improvements in these patients because they are more vulnerable than other age groups."
23825185,"In this study, we examine the effect of a high-fructose diet on blood lipid changes in men with and without heart disease. The results suggest that consuming fewer refined sugars may be an effective treatment for heart diseases. We also examine how fasting and glycemic response are affected by the different types of food consumed. Frucosal is more effective than cornstarch in reducing blood glucose levels in hyperinsulinic men. This suggests that consumption of low-sugar foods may lead to increased risk of heart attack in these men"

A significant reduction in risk for coronary heart diseases was observed in those with chronic renal disease who received gemfirzil than placebo. This trial also examined whether bezafisibrate could reduce the risk of stroke in people with type 2 diabetes. It was found that both regimens did not improve the incidence of myomyocardial atherosis or sudden death. However, there were no significant differences among the two groups regarding the severity of the secondary outcome. For example, after six months, the cumulative risk to fatal or non fatal myofa rck ion had been reduced from 2.3% to 18.2%. Furthermore, it was noted that although some of these results were due to changes in blood lipid levels, they were not related to other factors."
27317033,"Between January 2000 and November 2002, 40 patients who had acute calculus-choleciestitis were initially assigned to early or delayed laparoscomy. The results of the study suggest that early treatment is more advantageous in terms of reduced hospital stay and improved organ function. In contrast, delayed treatment has a higher rate of complications and conversion. A further study suggests that delayed surgery may be preferable for patients with mildly acute cholestotics because it requires less frequent changes in technique and allows for greater patient safety. This paper also discusses the use of percutaneous drainage as an alternative treatment for acute severe choecustitises. It concludes by stating that this form of treatment does not cause significant morbidity. However, there are still concerns about its efficacy in treating these patients."

We find that there is no significant relationship between the Retropulsion Test and backward body-sway after 20 support surface motions during the ""off"" phase but no relationship during either phase. This raises concerns about whether or not it is appropriate to use the retropulator test as compared to dynamic postureography. The results suggest that balance correcting ankle tensions are weaker than controls for both the most affected and least affected sides."
28673352,"In this study, we examine the effects of fish oil and n-3) polyunsultured fatty acids in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Both groups show significant reductions in total fat mass and subcutaneous abdominance. The results suggest that these two different lipids may have different effects on various disease states. For example, there are no significant differences between serum total cholesterol and lipoprotein cholesterol. Furthermore, both treatments increase the secretion of interleuvinin 2, which is related to improved insulinsensitivity. This study also compares the anti-inflammatory effect of both drugs on cell function and systemically inflammation in type 2 Diabetes mellitated patients. These patients were divided into two groups: one group was assigned to a placebo; the other group received either atorvastain or fish oils. After four and 12 weeks, respectively, the control group showed improvement in blood pressure, body weight, and physical activity. A double blinded trial was conducted to determine the efficacy of ecotsapenteoic acid on overweight patients who had Type 1 diabetes melanitus. There were not significant adverse effects from vitamin E. However, treatment with EPA for three months did not improve any of the primary outcome events."

This study concludes that an eight-week exercise program can significantly improve symptoms of fagitalgia."
31461458,"In this paper, Wiley and Sons examine the effects of community based health insurance on health expenditure in rural India. They find that it is more cost effective for poorer people to use public health services than private hospitals. However, they do not find any effect on out-of pocket expenditures when compared to uninsureded patients. This paper also uses a fixed effects model to assess the impact of three different types of government schemes on spending. The first was an incentive-based scheme designed to improve access to care for low- income families. It did not have measurable effects on overall health outcomes; however, it did reduce the likelihood of death among those aged 65 or older. Although there were some positive effects with regard to treatment seeking, these results seem to be limited."
23473733,"The relative risk of Type 2 diabetes is lowered by whole grain consumption. Consumption of refined grains does not significantly increase the risk, however, because they are more likely to be associated with higher blood sugar levels. Cmax and placebo treatment improve erythreocyte concentrations and improve insulin response. In addition, exercise leads to significant improvements in body composition, fitness, and other lipids. For type 2 patients, the dietary approach to stophypnotism reduces blood pressure and increases oxidative-stress. This suggests that the Dash diet may be more effective than other anti-hypertension treatments."
23935716,"This study compares the early- and mid-term results of two different prostheses used for total kneearthroplasty. Both groups have similar baseline characteristics, but there is no significant difference in post-opportunity after 5 years. The fixed bearing group has a greater range of motion than the mobile bearing one; however, the patients do not suffer from any osteolysis or loss of function at all. In another study, we compare the short-lived performance of an implanted bearing with that of rotund bearing devices. After one year, neither group achieves significant improvement in pain or stiffness. A further study examines whether the patient's movement is affected by the wear of the bearing device as well as by changes in the size of their bone. It is concluded that the wearing device does not improve knee function either. However, it does improve some knee functions."
23375241,"In men with moderately to severe symptoms due to B.P., combination therapy and dutastesteride and/or a combination are superior to monotherapy in terms of improvement in the International Prostate Score, International Urgency Scores, and quality of life. The 4-year CombAT trial provides evidence for long-term efficacy as well as safety in patients with mild to moderate upper urinary tract conditions. A study is conducted in China to investigate the efficiacy and safetyof combined oral therapy plus sildendafil and alphablocker compared to single treatment in treating Chinesemen with ectorile dysfunction and lower urinarry tract symptoms secondaryto benign prostatichypoplasia. This study was conducted at hospitals in Beijing, Shanghai, Changshe, Wuhan, Guangzhou, five major city in china. There were not significant differences in means age, IIEF-5, Iss Score pre-treatment among the two groups; there were no significant changes in side effects during the treatment Period. Both regimens were safe and well tolerated. Men who underwent surgery or prostate surgery had an increased relative risk reduction when they received either drug. For this reason, both treatments performed well over the four-year time period. Under real life conditions, treatment of Ophelia symptoms with proptiverine ER has equally effective in those with M.T. or C.C. regardless of baseline Gmax. Over the course of four years, 2,219 subjects participated in safety analysis. 1,800 men were involved inefficacy analysis: 1,8249 men met the inclusion criteria. Methods Man aged 40 years with Oabb symptoms, Qmax 7 ml per day, PSA between 7 and 15, mmL/s. Postvoid residual urine volume was found to increase only in group 1 but this was never accompanied by Urinary Retention. Adverse Events weremonished throughout the study. Mean IPsS was reduced from base line by 7.5 % after the combination group, by 6 0.81, in comparison with 2 %) in Dutasteder alone. No unexpected events emerged. At month 24, the mean change from baseline was 6.3 versus 6.4 vs 2.16 pp. hg. respectively. After 12 weeks, average Micturition Volume was significantly improved only on group 2 but that was not accompanies by urgency Uritory"

30007275,"In this study, the authors examine whether a diet of 20 g. per day is safe for patients with type two diabetes and whether there are any differences in blood pressure, body weight, or other metabolic parameters between the three different diets. The results indicate that the low fat, lower carbogeneic diet is more effective than the traditional Mediterranean diet at reducing fasting glucose by as much as six percent. They also report that they have no significant differences on other measures of health such as changes in body mass, Hba1c, and othermetabolism. Aims To compare the effect of lifestylemodifications that recommend low-glcemic load to those that prescribe high-carbidohydrate diet; these regimens do not differ significantly upon other important outcome measures. After 6 months, subjects lose an average of 7.97 4.9 kg while those on the Low Fat, Low Carbohidrate group lose only 3.7 p.t."
26803696,"The fracture-related patient population is described in this paper. There are nine patients who have been treated with either Gamma or Ambbi nail, and the results of their surgery are compared to those of the other two groups. In terms of functional outcome, there is little difference between the two methods. For example, after three months, the mean bone healing rate for the PFN device is 85.00 p.m.; however, when comparing it to the sliding hip screw, they find that the wounds heal at a much faster rate. This study compares the use of both devices for treating unstable intertrocanteric fractured patients. Both devices improve the quality of life but do not lead to significant changes in the length of hospital stay. They also show that different design characteristics can influence fracture healing. A prospective study evaluating the performance of percutaneous compression plates on stable trochanterric neck fractures has been performed. It was found that these devices were more cost effective than the conventionally used dynamic hip screws."
25099546,"In this study, we examine the effect of a fructosic diet on body weight and blood lipids in overweight men. The results suggest that the high-fat diet is more effective than the low-glucosole diet in improving liver function. We conclude that these results are due to the fact that both groups have stable bodies with concentrations of gallstones or other liver enzymes. A nine point categorical classification system was developed for missing outcome reports from all eligible trialists; it was then used to assess the extent of bias in the reporting of outcome outcomes in trials not included in any of the original studies. This analysis was carried out by sensitivity analysis and specificity analysis."
24824056,"In this study, we examine the effect of a combination of total arch debribe and second pre-molar extraction on malocclusion in Class I patients. The results show that there is no significant difference in canine retraction between the two treatment groups. A mean accuracy of 35.8% for canines was achieved with Invisalsalign. This study also compares the susceptibilities of enamel surfaces treated with fluoride immediately after an ARS procedure to those treated by fixed orthodontic therapy. Both groups showed good initial skeletal and dental characteristics. In the control group, however, the patient's nansolabial angles were reduced significantly."
31321227,"This study focuses on the reliability of the L test of Functional Mobility for predicting fall in older adults. Eighty subjects completed a balance assessment and six months afterward, they performed well on both the brief-bettest and the modified Emorying Functional Amblation Profile tests. The results suggest that the test may be used to predict multiple falls in communitydwelling patients."
25353646,"A prospective, i.e. single-blind study of patients with critical illness who received mechanical ventilation showed that the use of electrical muscle stimulators was effective in preventing hypothecy and improving functional recovery. In this study, we examined the effects of electric muscle stimulation on strength of different muscle groups in patients suffering from critical illnesses. Muscle strength was significantly higher among the EMS treatment group than the controls group. This is an important finding because it suggests that using electrical muscles to improve muscle strength may prevent hypotrophy while improving function. Furthermore, there is some evidence that exercise training can be used to reduce the risk of injury by decreasing quadricep's atrophy."
23967064,"Walking and bicycling are associated with reduced risk of stroke in a large-scale, cross-sectional study. The results suggest that leisure time activity may be especially beneficial for people with mild to moderate heart disease. A self-help intervention is used to increase walking and riding ability among 295 Swedish employees who have been thinking about or doing something irregular. This intervention has an odds ratio of nearly twice as likely as the control groups at six months. In this small, observational trial, we examine the relationship between mild physical activity and the risk for hypotension during 6-16 years of observation. We follow 47 721 Finn subjects 25 to64 years old without history of chest disease, stroke, or cancer. Our aim is to determine whether walking or bi Cymbeline's walk to school can reduce the chance of developing Type 2 diabetes. It is found that walking does not lead to increased blood pressure but rather increases it."
19776505,"The aim of present study is to compare the efficacious use of enamel matrix protein, emptified with bovine porosteal bone mineral, and regenerative tissue regeneration in periodontal defect defects. In both groups, there is significant gain of attachment level gain as well as pocket depth reduction. Both treatments result in significant improvements in terms of probing deepness and attachment gain; however, they do not show any significant differences between control and experimented groups. This study also shows that EMPs can be used as barrier membranes for guided tissue rejuvenation. A controlled clinical trial evaluates the effect of two different surgical morphologies on deep intrabonies: 1) using an enamel-matrix protege or 2) using a Bioresorbable Collagen Membrane."
12804434,"A randomized, controlled trial compares resistance training with self-pacing walking. The subjects show significant increases in body weight and muscle mass after six months' resistance exercise. In older adults, the effects of strength training are similar to that of three days per week in younger adults. Two different types of exercises are used to reduce falls among elderly patients. One group is given basic enhanced programming; the other is an exercise program consisting only of short, intermittent contracts. Both groups improve their performance on measures of daily living functions over a two-year period. Elderly patients who fall report lower scores on Fostein mini-mental state examination and functional activities of Daily Living Scores. They also experience greater declines than controls in these measures. This study was conducted in the rural village of Kahok, Japan, where the population of whom is considered representatives of the older populace of Japan. Pre-design subjects were assigned for age and habitsual physical activity, and then matched for Age and habitual Physical Activity, followed by rematches for both groups. Measurements were recorded for each group at baseline and follow-up: Neck Mass Index and Blood Pressure. All measurements were measured for either group before or after implementations were: Maximum oxygen consumption, oxygen pulse, Tread and Cycle training workloads, Quadricepsisokinetic Peak Torque, quadricepes isokint peak torque, Muscle fiber area, Type I fiber areas, Cross sectional area as well as tissue composition"
24212996,"In this paper, we review the evidence for the efficacy of two different types of sealants, based on whether they can prevent caries in teeth. The first is a high-visosity glass Ionomer, while the second is an energy-suppled resin-based product called Lignite Cartificial Frissure Sealant. We conclude that there are significant differences between the two types over varying time intervals."
29615407,"The aim of the present study is to determine whether a high or low-Glycemic Index diet can reduce body weight in overweight women. In this study, forty-four overweight females were assigned to either an Hgi or LgI diet for 10 weeks. Both diets resulted in improved blood pressure, reduced waist size, and increased food consumption. This was supported by the European Council's recommendation that ""the combined effect of ala, musfa"" and low Glycation on gycemac control and CVDA risk factors in Type 2 diabetes."" However, only the Low-GI diet was more effective than the other two. Furthermore, it was found that changes in fat and carbohydrate consumed together did not lead to significant weight gain. Thus, these studies do not support the benefit of reducing fat with glib change in carbohydrates. Instead, they suggest that changing the source of fuel leads to greater weight loss. These studies are published in the medical literature."
25532993,"In this study, we examine the association between elevated oestroglin and testosterone levels and increased risk of type 2 Type 2 diabetes. We find that women with higher levels of these two chemicals are more likely to develop disease later in life than those with lower levels. Furthermore, high blood pressure is associated with an increased susceptibility to developing type 2, particularly among women who have not used conventional treatment."
21925051,"The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of valartan, amlodipines, and atenotics on the relapse of atrium fibrillation after successful heart failure. In this study, we find that dronedarone is superior to placebo in maintaining an adequate sinus rhythm for patients with left-ventricular dysfunction. We conclude that it may be worth considering as a treatment for those who have severe heart failing."
27395403,"In this paper, we discuss the mistakes made by physicians who conduct retrospective chart reviews in order to determine whether or not a particular drug is safe and efficacious for treating children with tic disorder. The results of this study suggest that he may be an effective and moderately effective treatment for patients with Tourette's disorder because it reduces both physical and verbal aggression. Although no serious side effects are reported, the safety and tolerateability of the drug are described. Aripisprazole has been shown to be more effective than other antipsychotic drugs in treating childhood typhoid disorders."
26883234,"This study focuses on the effect of different surgical approaches on patients with Crohn's disease. The results suggest that there is a negative relationship between wound healing speed and perceived stress, but this does not seem to be related to altered health behavior. A prospective follow-up study was conducted in which 205 patients underwent short-term surgery for cholinecystomectomy. After two years, all patient-regarding quality of life were improved. In contrast, complications were minimal or no effects on these measures. Post-surgery improvement was limited because of lack of response from question-questionnaires during the regular visit by the surgeon. Short-stay surgery had little effect on bloodshed at 1 year; however, it did improve general health perception, social, and mental domains. Hepatobilic malignancy has been reported in several studies. However, few studies have examined the association between pre-operative risk factors and post-operative outcomes after laparoscopic cobbling. These studies provide further evidence regarding the impact of surgery on overall health status."

In this paper, we examine the effect of different attributions to overweight and obesity on negative attitudes toward these two groups. We find that changing children's beliefs regarding the controllableness of weight will reduce their negative views toward fat people. However, it is not possible to completely change those beliefs."
32172237,"In this study, a 1-mg./dl increase in high-Density Lipoprotein cholesterol is associated with significant risk of heart disease for men and women. The British Heart Study reported that much of its inverse relation to highdensit lipophosphoproteincholester transfer protein was eliminated bycovariance adjustment. This trial also showed that anace trapib could be used as an additional lipid-modification therapy in patients with low-denisity LDL-c goal. After three months, the mean high DLC level was 42 Mg per Deciliter. At the end of the trial, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of liver enzymes or creatine kinsae elevations. Acute Coronary Heart Disease: Risk Decrement Of 2 %) in men, PPT,and MRFIT; and 3 p.m. in women who did not receive any other treatment. Anacetrab improved both their blood levels and their safety. They had no meaningful differences in the proportional changes in liver function or muscle symptoms among the patients treated with either drug. For patients without heart disease, statins were sufficient to control elevated blood pressure. However, they failed to reduce HDL- C levels. These results suggest that it may be difficult to improve HCL-C levels because some ceteril ester transfer protege inhibitors have been shown to lower LH-contents without improving cardiovascular events."
27037567,"In this paper, we describe the results of a blinded, randomed, and controlled trial comparing the efficacy to direct pulp caping with either calcium enriched cement or mineral trioxidize aggregate. The results are as good as those obtained by conventional methods. Forty primary teeth in 40 children aged 5- 9 years have been treated with direct pulse capping. Histological studies need to be performed for further evidence. All teeth were restored with an amalgam base and all restorations were restored with glass IX and amalgam. Algorithms such as ""single blind"" and ""double blind,"" which refer to different types of blinding, are not used in this study. Blinding is important because it separates the process of random selection from the recruiter and participants. For example, many journals use double blindness as criterion for reporting on trials. This means that they do not report on the actual outcome but instead report what was done in the trial."
19307137,"A prospective, observational study of patients undergoing post-toromy pain is performed. Twenty patients were divided into two groups: IVCA and Cryo group. The first group consisted of cryoansia and morphine; the second group was composed of pre-operative analsics with no side effects. In this paper, we describe the results of a novel study in which twenty patients are assigned to one of two different groups after knee surgery. These include IVAC or CRYO groups. After six months, the patients receive less pain than they had before. This suggests that there may be some reason for pain not present before surgical intervention. Pain intensity at rest and during movement is greater in the IVA group than in either group but does not differ from those who have long-term painful experiences. We conclude by examining whether there is any difference in pain and recovery between the muscle sparing technique and the axellary muscle splitting technique. Post-surgery pain did not vary among the two treatment groups except for the severity of the initial pain score. However, it was noted that both groups used more analgesicia than their other treatment regimens. For example, cryingoanalgea combined with vaginal epidural AnalgisIa was found to reduce pain significantly when compared to cryostomies alone. Furthermore, these studies suggest that cryonalsteaesiastic combination with caduceus nerve block can improve pain management."
23901263,"The prevalence of ""hot flushes"" in women from the early 1900s to the mid-1990s was characterized by a high prevalence at age 53. In contrast, treatment became more effective for this group during the observational period. There were no further improvements in fracture risk below '55 - 60 percent forCTX and 35 -- 40 %) for NTx'. A survey of 594 postmenopalous women found that the frequency of hot flash experiences was very high among those experiencing them. Although there were significant reductions in total lipoprotein, LDL, cholesterol, and bone turnover, all changes were associated with reduced hip, spine, or vertebral breakage. At week 12, BZA/Ce significantly improved sexual function and satisfaction of life measures in  symptomsatic postmanopausalsal women. After adjustment for possible confounders, current Estrogen use was associated With reducing the risk of wrist fractures; relative risk was as follows: Chad, 1. 29 th. 1 dr. 286 cases; breast cancer, 1, 26 t h  59 )with 290 cases"

The results suggest that balance training with an omization of movement-assisted by motor imagery may be more effective than physical exercise alone. This study is a follow-up of recurrent stroke patients who received either physical or non-physical treatment. After six months, the group showed significant reductions in falls and improved quality of life."
28700715,"In this study, the effects of a combination of behavior therapy and medication on children with ADHD are investigated. The results suggest that both treatment regimens lead to significant improvements in symptoms and behavior. For example, subjects assigned to Clon alone or Mph alone showed significant improvement for their symptoms. A mixed-effects model was used to assess the safety and effectiveness of two different treatments: 1) clonine plus morphine; and 2) an alternative treatment known as ""methylphenidate"" combined with hypnotism. Both studies were found to be highly efficacious."
28869278,"During the first three months of life, 61 patients with a preterm birth weight were treated in this study. The rate of hypoxia during these two groups was not significantly different. In addition, the relative risk for early and late post-opportune complications was relatively low. A total of thirteen16 infants had been studied. There are limited evidence to inform the decision between early treatment or surfactant as the initial supports for extremely preterminative infant children. Although the consolrment statement is relatively high, it can not be recommendd outside scholarly setting. For example, there are specific issues that relate to trials of other drugs, such as surgery, technical intervention, devices, rehabilitation, psychotherapy, and behavior intervention. Consoler's group develops an extension of ""the Console date d"" which describes the quality of opinion and recommendation for all of the treatments. However, some specific issue that applies to trial of non-pharmacical treatments -- for example; surgery,technitaria,devices,rehabilitation,psychology,andbehavior intervention -- are not explicitly addressed in the Consorit statement. Therefore, they developed an explanation and explanation document by the ConSort group. This document includes descriptions of several aspects of medical care from the perspective of patient safety to health management. These include: 1) use of nearinfringed spectropography to assess cerebral oxygenation at resting time; 2) using electrodes to track blood flow after acute arrest; and 3) using machinelearning strategies to predict changes in brain injury. At an urban hospital, we report on the blindly assessment and examined treatment effects on EEG outcomes. Burst rates and temporal edge frequency were greater than those of control groups. Furthermore, both groups showed significant differences in their response to electrode readings. They also reported no difference in blood biosigners of brain injuries. Preventive measures are keyto reduce mortality and Morbidity in extreme pre term infant populations. Trials reporting contradictory or stronger effects did not have any significant effect. Only studies reporting strong effects were smaller than replicated nor unchallanged studies. Bivariate analysis and multivariates logistic regression were used to calculate the risk of premature morbidities. Brain injury was associated with numerous adverse systemic outcome. Short- and long terms of morbiity were more frequent in very lowbirth weight babies treated before and afterwards. Patients with"

25100025,"After 11 years, a total of 27 sets of replacements are evaluated using modified United State Public Health Service Criteria. The reason for failure was fracture of restoration, four filling/inlays, five inlay's, secondary cariies, and loss-of-proxial contact. Twenty-Eight sets were placed in 28 premolar teeth and 52 mmilds in 29 adults. All the examined restoration systems were evaluated after four years. None of them required replacement, but there was no detectable wear on any of the restoreds. In this study, all dentin bonds were bonded with Bisfil 2b or Floatit to prevent pulpal necosis. This study also examines the effect of composite resin on tooth healing. It found that ""compomer resin restorations"" were more likely to have an adverse outcome than amalgam. Furthermore, it was concluded that treatment by conditioning and sealing could be more effective than conventional cement."
28275869,"In this study, we compared the efficaciousness of flax-seed oil, coconut, and other fatty acids on blood markers of inflammation in patients with chronic heart failure. The primary endpoint is death, non- fatal myo Cardiol infa Crt Ion, or stroke. A mixed-effects model was used to predict the relative risk of each outcome from different sources of information: high-sensitivity Crp, serum ammyloid A, interleakin-6/and soluble intercellulin-3. This analysis was performed in a doubleblind, multi-centre, placebo-control trial. We found no significant differences between the four groups except for changes in body mass index and lipoprotein levels. Furthermore, there was an increased relationship between C-Reactive Protein and the body Mass Index. These results suggest that alpha-Linolelic acid may be useful as an anti-inflammatory agent in hypercholesteremic patients."

We find no significant differences between basal and total BNP levels in the piglitazen treatment group; however, there are no clear differences in histological characteristics among the different groups. Thirteen DM1 patients with no signs of heart failure received piogiltane or buformine for 6 months. The results showed that piolitizen was associated with improved histologetic findings regarding steasis, ballooning Nerosis/Inflammation, and fatigue. Piogliitazone was also more effective at reducing body weight than either regimen; it did not cause any adverse events."
31452084,"In this paper, we present the results of an in-hospital smoking cessations intervention for patients with acute myosmia. All patients were randomized to either usual care during their hospital stay or to a combination of regular care and treatment after discharge. The main outcome was number of smokeless patients, acutely at risk of relapse, health care costs, and cost per quiter. A Monte Carlo study was performed to predict the cost of such standardized services as well as the expected lifetime savings from the intervention. It found that the standard care group had the greatest cost efficacy over the long term. However, it showed that there was no significant improvement in quality adjusted lifeyears when comparing the three conditions. Cost per quitter was not significantly different between the two groups; however, telephone counseling did have the highest probability being cost effective. This paper also discusses the use of physician's advice to prevent heart attack among patients who are already smoking."

16908917,"In this study, we examine the effects of financial incentives on physicians' compliance with preventive care. Physicians receive a cash incentive and additional fee for service in addition to their regular visits to check on children. The results indicate that physician practices are better able to perform more effectively when they have greater access to evidence-based approaches to immunizing patients. This is important because it means that physicians do not need to be motivated to change their practice tactics."
24242888,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of balance problems in patients who have had a mild brain injury for several years. The results suggest that there may be some improvement in balance after one injury and that further research needs to be done. Thirty young adults perform solitary posture-only tasks and then simultaneously perform dual-task tasks. After three trials, subjects show significant improvements in both performance and error scores. This study uses the Stand and Ardized Assessment of Conscussion and Bale Error Scores as tools to assess postural control. It is concluded that the use of the Besse score as an instrument for assessment of posturgy has potential applications in conicssed patients."
28913588,"This is a singlecentre, singleblind placebo-controlled trial of 150 patients with prematurely ejculation who had been treated for at least one year.

In this study, all four drugs have tolerable effects: patient ages, Intrvaginal Latencies, Penile Sensory threshold values, and evoked Potential test in both groups are not significantly different when the beginning of treatments were p / 0.05. Safety and Tolerability were assessed. Aim We investigate safety andefficacy of parophetine alone or paroxenine plus tamefil in premature men with life long rapid escorting. ParaoXeten alone and parometine plus sertraline were investigated in subjects with lifetime rapid excretion. Their primary PE score was 0  almost never, 8  = almost always. Adverseeffects in 7 out of 42 men included an erexia in 3, anorezi in 1, and reduced licidoin in 2. These studies include two other related studies. One examines the effect of vardonafil and serotoninate on pre-ejaculating patients; they found no significant differences in their scores after 1 month. Two other studies evaluate the benefits of sil denaffil as compared to that of Paronox alone. They conclude that it has much better latency time than either drug group."

The results of this study indicate that the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score is a good measure of quality of life for patients with knee or hip pain. In addition, it has been found that patients are more satisfied with their physiotherapist than they are with surgeons. A prospective observational study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of an adherence-based program for shoulder pain management by emergency nurses and extended scope physicians."
24508930,"The effects of eight-week resistance exercise on strength and performance in persons with stroke are investigated. In the first group, Strength significantly improves walking speed and gait velocity while the second group only increases their muscle strength. This study is designed to examine the effect of an eight week resistance training program on functional improvement in people with multiple cradles. Aeerobic training does not improve leg press strength but rather improve other measures of strength such as power and endurance. Stenth's results do not increase lower leg strength in individuals with down syndrome. However, they do improve balance and mobility in patients with MS. For example, one hundred patients consented for a long-term intervention after stroke. Another study examining the efficaciousness of supervised progressive resist training on lower arm strength, function, and disability among older stroke survivors. Thirteen subjects received no significant differences between groups for either performance-based measures or injury-related measures. Sixty subjects retain at baseline; 27 women, 45 men; mean age 62 years; 64.6 years old; Mean+/-Standard Determination 5. Mobility Function was measured using the Gross motor Function Measure and Timed ""Up and Go"" test. Strength improved significantly in both groups during the initial period of the trial. Muscle tone increased greatly in the resistance train group. After stroke, physiotherapists can promote brain recovery and motor recovery. Resistance training has been used in children and adults with spastics since the most recent studies have found insufficient scientific evidence to support it."
26503388,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective open-cohort study on patients with high risk of heart disease. We use standardized risk scores to predict how much each patient will be at risk for major and sub-primary strokes. This is important because it allows us to compare different groups of patients across different age groups. For example, one group has higher risk than another in terms of total cholesterol, blood pressure, and smoking. The other group also has lower risk when compared to the usual care group. Furthermore, there are no significant changes in self-reported eating habits or physical activity among those with low risk."

We also discuss the use of an ""Icruss"" model to improve risk factor management among stroke survivors. This study compares the effects of self-efficiecacy and lifestyle changes on blood flow control after stroke. The main endpoint is improvement in patient knowledge about stroke warning signs at three months' follow-up. A further study examines whether pharmacists can be used as case managers to reduce the risk of acute stroke in patients with high-risk pre-existing vascular disease."
24863864,"In this study, we examine the effects of a combination of antidepressive drugs and brain-stimulating exercises on depressed patients. The results suggest that these treatments may be more effective in improving depressive symptoms than they are in treating other conditions. We conclude that although there is little difference between the two classes of treatment, it is clear that both approaches work. Brain Snack: Cognitive Deprivation is one of the most common psychological disorders in older adults. Although many studies have suggested that mental health problems can be improved by exercise, few have examined the use of either type of therapy. For example, several studies indicate that using repetitive exercises to improve memory functions in elderly patients who have major depression. However, no evidence exists for any effect of such exercises in general."

The results showed significant differences between the two groups: AST 69.6, LDL cholesterol0.84, Crap 2.9, Tnf-0.45, and NASH activity indices. We conclude that increased exposure to intestinal ""bacterial products"" may lead to the pathogenetic action of non alcohol fatty liver diseases. This study is a double blinded single center randomised control trial among 60 patients who had been previously treated with conventional treatment. After eight weeks of treatment, the mean changes in blood pressure, heptosis, and other laboratory markers were observed. Both groups received an energy balanced diet as well as physical activity recommendations. Acute probiotic therapy was shown to be superior to conventional care in terms of reducing steastisses and improving overall health. Another controlled clinical trial was performed in which 50 patients aged 25-64 years old were divided into three groups receiving either Lactobacilus reutei or usual care for six months. Probiotics did not significantly reduce body mass index or FEV1 levels. However, they did improve hempatic stench and liver function."
27501434,"In this chapter, we discuss the results of two recent studies. The first is a pilot study of an intervention called ""Project Support"" to reduce conduct and behavior problems among children who have been exposed to domestic violence. Parents in the project condition report greater reductions on inconsistent and harsh parent-child behavior and psychetric symptoms than those in control groups. Both conditions are highly efficacious; however, they do not lead to improvement in features of mental illness. For example, mothers in both groups show greater improvements in their child-behavior and parenting behavior. A second trial examines the effects of parents' co-parenting training on children with externalizing disorders. This treatment improves over time but does not result in improvement for all diagnoses. Two other studies suggest that early childhood education may be more effective in treating patients with drug use disorder than adult treatment."
21331532,"In this article, we examine the possibility that randoxed or omised trials of acupointment for pain may result in false positive results. Based on an extensive literature search, thirteen studies were found to meet our inclusion criteria. All studies suggested that ""A-B versus B"" design is likely to generate False Positive Results."" We conclude that there are not changes of maternal and fetal well being or other side effects associated with such treatment. Conclusions We have not detect alterations of Fetal and maternal wellbeing nor otherside-effects caused by moxibation applied to the Bleak presentation. Aconite cakeseparated moxonation has an ideal medicinal effect on knee Ostearthritis; the therapeutic effectatane at ana phase is better than those of sodium Diclofenedate Slow- released tablet. After the ends of treatment, there was little difference in the Comprehensive Therapeutic effect between the 2 groups. The cured andmarkedly effective ratewas 63.4 %) inthe cake-seleparized moloxibustion band and 48.7% in both groups but two months later, the  cure and markedly efficacious rate of 56.2 % in either group was better then 33.3 p.."
29154069,"In this study, we report on the efficaciousness of Nigelle sativea in patients with moderate hypertension. The results suggest that it is safe and effective for treatment of mild to moderate hysteria. A doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to evaluate the safety andefficacy of an oral Niglitazen extract supplement in Type 2 diabetes. At week 24, the mean reduction after HbA 1c was 0.42% for placebo vs. 0.82, and /0.97 %) for dapaglaiflozi 5 and 10mg groups respectively. They were further divided into two groups: one group received only Nsativa as a dietary intervention; the other group took no part in the study. This study also investigated the effects of Nne on pancreatic cell function and histopathography in rats. It was found that both groups showed significant improvement in their disease activity scores. After 12 weeks, the change in blood pressure was reduced by 0.52 %. As expected, these results are not significant from the initial point of view."
21150647,"In this study, infants were divided into two groups based on their gestational period, birth weight, gender and previous breast-fed. The first group was given a prefabricated infant formula with the Lactobacilus paracaseis strain in it; the second group received an infant milk mixture of short chain galacide and long chain fiberooligosesaccharides. After safety and tolerance were established, they were assigned to either one of three groups: Bb-12 or st/ard formula. At 16 weeks, no significant difference was found between the two regimens. A mixture consisting of neutral short chains galactologosacchardes and longer chain fructo Oligostesccides had been shown to lower the incidence of infection during the first six mo of life. Infants who received the mixture showed reduced risk of allergic reactions and increased growth. These results suggest that probiotics may have protective effects beyond the intervention phase. This study is designed to assess the efficacy for acute malnutritions in Malawian children aged 5 to 18 months. It uses rotavir-contaminated salivary samples as sample specimens from seventy patients. When the babies are fed containing both types of bacteria, there is little difference in stool frequency and stool consistency. There is no effect on the severity of side effects such as crying, regurgition, or weight gain."
26358067,"In this study, we examine the effects of a probiotic-fermented infant formula on the gut microbial balance in healthy newborns. The results indicate that fermented formulations can be effective in reducing the severity of severe acute diarrhea among young infants who are not breastfed. We also find that the efficacy of these new feeds is superior to that of conventionally-flused infant milk in terms of improving the health of the infant and decreasing the number of hospital visits. Furthermore, the use of cow's milk reduces the risk of an allergic reaction when compared to other forms of milk. A parallel study was conducted to investigate the effect of Lactobacilus casei or Streptococcius termphilus on Secretory Immunoglobulin concentrations in saliva after six weeks of treatment."
28263370,"The results of the first three trials in this paper are compared with those of other anti-thrombotic agents. In phase 2, the combination pill group improved adherence to the recommended regimen for secondary prevention after an acute myocardiac infatriate ion, sudden death, heart failure, and coronary arteries re Vascular Mortality. A polypill that contains aspirin, statin or two blood pressure decreasing agents was associated with lower risk of major cardiovascular complications than usual care. This study is part of ""The Kanyinis Guidelines Adherance with the PolyPill"" trial designed to evaluate whether a fixed dosage combination pills could improve  adherence to guideline-indicted therapies and lower blood tension and cholesterol levels. It is based on systelic bloodpressure reduction by 7.7 mmHhg at 8 weeks."
31703073,"In this paper, Siller and colleagues report on the effects of a theater-based peer-mediation intervention on young children with autistic spectrum disorder. They conclude that some degrees of physiological restraining is essential to social interaction; however, they suggest that it may be more effective in improving social skills than other forms of treatment. A pilot study suggests that the theatre-induced intervention improves social competence in young adults with an audible or non-autism-like condition. The results are compared among thirty-eight-year-olds who have been assigned to either group: the PEERS Curriculum, n = 10, vs. waitlist control; or if there is no difference between immediate and four-month outcomes, the PEDI program: 10 versus 13 pts for social ability, communication symptoms, play-in-the company of peers, immediate memory/faces as measured by nervepsychological, and ERP methods. At the follow-up interval, groups showed improvement in social skill knowledge, social functioning, reductions in anxiety and stress. Parents reported significantly higher uses of evidence-base teaching strategies and higher level of child engagement at routines atT2 and T3. This article describes the use of ""Peer-Mediated"" parent-child intervention for children aged 2 to 9 years with severe autism. It was found that parents were happier when their child received daily care from trained therapists and that children's communicative abilities improved over time. Children also showed greater gains in language and executive function after receiving one-on-one attention from their parents."
16235365,"Estrogen and rogent therapy improves bone mineral density in post-progressal women. In addition, it reduces the incidence of new fractures and increases the frequency of satisfying sexual activity. The effects of both regimens on body weight, body composition, and fat distribution are examined in this study. Estradiol has no significant effect on bone growth; however, there is a significant increase in bone mass in the treatment group. A double blinded trial compares two groups of treatments: estrogen alone or combined with progesterin. Women receive either treatment for their symptoms before and after surgery. They respond better than placebo at the return of these symptoms. However, they do not show any change in physical or psychological well being during the first three months of treatment. This suggests that menopause may lead to increased risk of heart disease. Although some studies have suggested that adding testosterone to estrone can counteract breast tissue proliferation, none have yet been published."
29178166,"In this study, we examine the effect of different irrigation techniques on the removal of debris from root canals. The results show that the endovac system is more effective than the other two methods; however, there are still significant differences in the sensitivity of the technique to remove the layer of dead pulpal tissue. We also compare the effectiveness of three different types ofirrigating agents: passive ultrasonic irrigation, an acoustic negative pressure system, and an electric current. Our results indicate that both methods work best for removing the thickest part of tooth's dentin."
30477509,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates the use of a 7 day accelerometer-assertion protocol to predict physical activity and time in older adults. The results suggest that it is possible to use cut-off points instead of using correlations to determine whether an accurate assessment is obtained. This approach uses graphical methods to compare the performance of different wear-time measures with respect to age, BMI, and season. For each measure, the Intrclass Correlations are calculated for each metric; interclass relationships were calculated by linear-mixing models and adjustedfor wear time / age, age:BMI & season. Results indicate that the interval between measurements is similar across age and gender. A subset from the Women's health study has been used in several studies but there is not consensus on how to interpret the data. Both methods yielded valid group-level prediction under controlled conditions but were less accurate at distinguishing stepping verse no-stepping behavior in free living condition. Conclusions That r and Om Forest Classifier for wrist aceleometer data Yields accurate group level predictions under control conditions whereas was less correct at identifying walking and running activities in freedom living conditions. Consciousness Although more accurate than field-based analysis, estimation accuracy for the algorithm developed from laboratory experiments was between 49 p. % wrist and 55 pp. An older woman performed selected activities while wearing three actigraph GT3X Plus activity monitors. Thirty five older adult women performed select activities during the laboratory experiment as well as wearing ActiGraph G3x+ activity tracker. All algorithmswere trained on laboratory or free-living information. Trial consisted of sitting, lying down, writing, computer game, lifestyle activities, sweeping...and laundry....etc. These trials consistted of ""sedentary actions"" ranging from lyingdown to writing to aerobics, basketball, throwing and catch up to ambulatory exercises. Cut points showed excellent agreement with TR, M., T. and P. respectively. Predictive values were averaged over all test participants at the minute levels for every behavior."
17253502,"In this study, the authors examine pretreatment factors involved in attrition of a patient's treatment for panic disorders. They conclude that there are several possible reasons for patients' decision to stop treatment: lower education, shorter length and prior treatment, higher anxietysensitivity, lower anguish sensitivity; and coping style which were not confirmed with best predictor studies. The results indicate that both drugs are effective in treating panic disorder but that side effects may interfere with the building up of optimal dose. A Swedish population of adults with or no agorahobic disease is described. There is significant gender difference between women and men in terms of their sex level. Two different types of therapy are studied: behavior therapy and imipraminic hydrochlorde. Both groups show improved efficacy. However, they do not result in relapses after six months of treatment. This suggests that it is important to treat patients who have been on medication for long enough to get better."
24282034,"This is the first large-scale, community-based study of the effect of morphine on major depression. It shows that it can be used as a stand-alone treatment for patients with moderate to severe depression who have not responded to other antidepressant treatments. In this study, Hamilton and his co-response group showed significant reductions in both measures of severity from baseline and after four weeks of treatment. They also found that imipramine was more efficacious than fluvaxamine when compared to placebo in patients suffering from major depressive disorder."
29131895,"In patients at high risk of heart attack after coronary bypass surgery, early treatment with angiotension-converting enzyme blockers does not improve outcome up to three years after the procedure. A double blinded placebo-controlled sacrificial trial was conducted in which 2553 patients received quinapirl, target dose40mg/d or placebo. The results were similar for all major endpoints except for the primary composite event: cardiovascular death and resucitated cardinal arrest; nonfatal Myocardial Ion, Coronary Revascularization, unstable Angina or Heart Failure requiring Hospitalization; documented angina and stroke. Adverse effects increased in the first three months after Caberg's intervention. After two years, however, no significant reduction in events occurred. To evaluate the effect of antihypensive drugs on diabetic complications, we compare blood pressures measured by electrodes of blood flow. At 3 year old, blood levels reached 136.6 74.8 mm H G. This study showed that strict control is superior to moderate control when compared to ""less stringent"" controls. It found that there was a lower rate of fatal and minor cardiovascular events and deaths from any cause but did not increase the severity of the disease. Furthermore, the combination therapy reduced the incidenceof hypotensives and syncope as well as renal dysfunction. Both regimens were well tolerated during the follow-up periods. However, it was unclear whether they would reduce the frequency of myocarital infaisrcition, stroke, or death due to hypertension. These studies are funded by the Canadian institutes health research and Astrazeneca."
31680952,"The patients were mostly male with a means of 44.3 years of age. 76.1 %) were married, and 58.5 p.m. had received previous drinking treatment. They were divided into two groups: the first group consisted of patients who had been abstinatenent for eight weeks; the second group was composed of those who did not have any alcoholism problems. In this study, we compare the effects of Nefazodome, - i.o. serotoneric antidepressants, with the Opioid Antagonist nalrexone  -- and an in active placebo in 184 alcohol dependent subjects receiving weekly ""relapse prevention"" psychotherapy. Nalatrexon treatment is associated with more adverse psychological and gastrointestinal effect, poorer conformity, as well as greater rate of attrition. Furthermore, the medical utility of nicotine seems limited by its detrimental effects. Acamproseate treatment over 18 days was consistently better than placebo to preserve abstainance and to diminish severity. After six months, however, it was not significantly different from the other treatments. This study concludes that nocturnal morphine therapy may be useful for treating alcohol dependence in rural communities."
24488616,"In this study, we examine the effects of three-month diet recall on blood pressure in adolescent patients with prehypertent or hypertension. The results indicate that Losartan is superior to analaprile for reducing mean daily bp and improving renal function in children who have elevated blood demands. We assess the long- term efficacious and safety of lasaran in treating hypertensives as well as in maintaining renal functioality in chronically ill children. Amlopidine is as good as diuretics and beta blockers in relieving high-strung adults with hyper tension. A double-blinded, parallel- group, dose-ranged trial was conducted in 49 centers in United States, Russia, and Israel. Blood pressure reductions were significantly greater in patients who switch from middle-and highdose losartans to placebo; mean increases in DBP were similar for all groups except for those who switched from mid- and high dosage lose artan to pooled valoran. This study confirms our previous observation that higher adultblood pressure predicts heart disease and improves renal functions in childhood."
30698254,"Conclusions The use of a measure of ""frilty"" to select older people at risk for intervention is better than using only their chronological age. For example, the relative strength of frailties in subjects with higher-global cognition has been found to be associated with dementia. A population-based cohort of elderly persons aged 70 years and older was collected from six different towns in the northern region of Netherland and s. This population included patients who needed geriatic treatment and making accurate medical treatment decisions. In this study, we examine whether frailstiness is associated by dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or non-Ad Dementia risk. Our results suggest that two well-known fraicitity measures -- the Self-Frillability Score and the Geriatric Acquiring Score -- are good at predicting major events such as falls, hospitalization, and emergency visits. We conclude that these measures are useful for gauging health status and predicting death."
20100340,"The effects of iron-deficiency treatment on changes in intelligence, mathematics, and IQ among Thai children are examined. Anemic mothers tend to be less attentive to their infants than nonaneic mothers. Iron deficient mothers perform better on tasks than those with anemia. In this study, the effect of zinc and iron on growth, psychological function, or infectious disease is investigated. Women aged 18-25 years old receive either daily iron or placebo. No significant change in morbidity is found. A double blinded trial was conducted for women aged 35y who were assigned either iron nor placebo; no significant effect on Morbidness was found"
21735443,"In this paper, we examine the effects of a blended learning approach on physicians' practice behavior. Physicians' interest in their private practice is related to their total number of visits made by patients during the study. A mixed-learning approach did not superior to an acclimation assessment and feedback system for improving knowledge regarding dementia management. The results indicate that both approaches improve physician practice practices. However, neither group has any significant differences between either intervention or control group. This study determines whether monetary incentives can improve compliance with immunizing care in ten primary care practices in Denmark. It shows that financial incentives appear to provide motivation but do not improve patient behavior; however, there are no significant difference between the two experimental groups."
18201645,"This paper focuses on the effects of brief physician intervention on heavy drinkers. It is shown that patients who receive brief advice reduce their alcohol consumption by an average of 11.5 drinks per week, compared with those who are given no treatment. The results suggest that brief physicians can be more effective than general practitioners in reducing excessive drinking. In older adults, this trial provides thefirst direct evidence that short intervention is associated With sustained reductionsin alcohol-use and health care utilization. A community-based drug abuse intervention was found to be highly effective in relieving symptoms of heavy drinking for young people aged 18 to 40. Although there were differences in severity between the two conditions, it was clear that self-help involvement was important in improving these outcomes."
28978497,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective long-term follow-up study of 101 boys with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder who had been previously suspected to have drug abuse. The results suggest that the most risk factor for developing antisocial behavior is the presence of ""adhd symptoms,"" which persist throughout the entire sample. This group includes adults with childhood and adulthood with both mild and severe ADHD. Children with persistent ADHD are more likely to be psyched, have more comorbity, and have greater functional impairment than controls. They also have higher odds of having an other psychological disorder than children without the disorder. These results confirm previous reports of high morbidness associated with these disorders. A case-control study was performed on 105 Caucasian boys aged 6 to 18 years with and without DSM-IV-R ADHD in order to estimate the prevalence of mental disease among these boys. We found that there were significant differences in the lifetime prevalences of all kinds of psychopathologies between control children and those with or without them. For example, over 80 pg/ml of hyperactive young adults had either opposal defyant disorder or conduct disorder at end."
23229424,"The results of the first two studies suggest that minimally adolescent hips can be safely performed with fewer complications and less time in the hospital. In this study, we examine the effect of comparing the short-lived technique of total hiparthroplasty to the conventional approach using thigh arthroplasty. We conclude that there is no significant difference in pain or functional outcome between the two approaches."
31311165,"The exercise-induced benefits of physical activity partly remained two years after Cessation of supervision. Four studies measured reduction in breast-cancer-related lymphodema, and seven studies report significant subjective improvements. A multi-disciplined trial was conducted to determine whether balance training can reduce the risk of falls among elderly women. In this study, older women aged 70-90 years who had suffered an accidental fall were assigned to either control or training groups. After six months, these changes were preserved in both groups; however, at follow- up, they showed no change in gait speed or balance confidence. This study concludes that a lifestyle-integrated approach to balance/strength training could be effective in preventing age-regular physical decline in old adults. It is well known that physical activities are important for older people, yet physicians remain pesimistic regarding the ability of elders with compromised functions to adhere to longer-term treatment. Conclusions Older adults whom have compromised physical performance are ableto sustain some ofthe benefits derived by participating in structured pa 2 years later after supervised treatments have been terminated. These patients were placed on low-calorie food, prescribed increasesin physical movement,and group counseling sessions. At followup, those in the intervention band reported regular exercise significantly over time, but there was only slight improvement in mental wellbeing."
22829395,"In this study, we examine the long-term Mortality risk of fractures in both women and men after a fracture. We find that mortality is higher for patients with all major and minor injuries than it is for those with no fracture at all. A prospective cohort of patients from Australia who have suffered an acute fracture has been studied. The results indicate that there is remarkably little difference between the incidence of subsequent fracture as compared to the general population. After 5 years, however, mortality rates are significantly higher among these groups. For example, one group of physicians receives more frequent BMD testing than the other. This suggests that physician practice may be better suited to increasing the frequency of bone mineral density testing and filling prescription drugs."
28658720,"In this study, we report the safety and tolerability of bovine lethal glucotin in infants who have low birth weight. The results suggest that prophylactic use of BLF reduces early-onset disease by reducing the risk of death from infection with Gram negative organisms. We also describe the effect of using LCG alone or in addition to other anti-cancarcer agents such as talactoferrin. Although there are no adverse effects, patients with severe disease may experience some side effects."
25926889,"The results of this study suggest that patients with low levels of vitamin D may have a favorable prognosis for hip fracture. In addition, the authors report that there is no association between blood levels and changes in functional performance at 6 weeks post-torture. Furthermore, they find no evidence for an association among 25-hydroxyvindal concentrations and risk of complications during total hip resurfacing. A further study suggests that higher levels are associatedwith lower risk for interfertial fibroses and tubular abduction."
28780542,"In this study, a group of 105 patients with Type 1 and Hba1c who received their usual care at the Delaware Veterans Affairs Medical center were recruited. They received web-based treatment that improved their blood glucose control over 12 months. The results showed that they had reduced A1C by 2.9% in comparison to education and usual medicine. This was due to the fact that many patients had access to telemonitory devices and other measures of health management. After an initial period of observation, all patients reported improvement in their disease control. For example, mean systelic blood pressure fell by 3.06 mmol for the intervention arm but did not reach statistical significance. Another study examined the effectiveness of patient-centered self-management methods on improving quality of life among patients without adequate medical care. These studies found no significant differences between the two groups. However, both groups' improvements in overall health were greater than those of the control group."
22917983,"In this paper, we describe the long-term efficacy results of Oros-MPH in adults with attention-disceptibility hyperactivity disorder. During the initial phase of treatment, patients showed significant improvements in their symptoms and behavior. After two years of follow-up, they were able to demonstrate that there was no difference in the severity or severity of their condition between treated and untreated patients. This is important because it indicates that adulthood may be more difficult for children with ADHD than for adults without it. The authors conclude by describing a large open-labeled trial of methylphini date in which subjects improved significantly in both short term and long term effects. They report that after three years, those who had been previously treated with morphine did not show any improvement in either physical or mental health. However, when compared to control groups, young adults who received atomoXetine showed greater improvements on the Wharton-ReimHerr Adult Deficit/Hyteractivity Disorder Score, ClinicalGlobal Impression-AdhD-Severness, and State Trait Anxious Inventory."
14584022,"In this study, we examine the effect of a calcium-supplementation regimen on bone loss in older women. After two years, there is significant reduction in bone mineral content in all groups except for trace minerals alone. This suggests that older females can be further arrested by concomiant increases in their trace mineral intake. A two-year trial compares the effects of an eight-week course of calcium and vitaminD on postmenostopausalsal bone mass. The results suggest that bone losses are more rapid in younger women than they are in control subjects. Women with osteoporoseis who receive only one or two daily doses of these nutrients lose most of their bone during the first three months of treatment. However, when the amount of additional bone lost due to pregnancy is taken into account, it is found that the addition of either type of mineral does not lead to any significant change in overall bone health."
30202163,"The results of this prospective study indicate that the rate of healing of teeth after root end resection is higher in the Mta group than Com. However, the information about the success rate is largely based on one to two year follow-ups. A prospectio ve outcome studies of perioral surgery using Cement was conducted on fourteen permanent teeth with persisting apciatic periodonitis. All patients are available for recall. In this study, all patients were treated with cement and root filling material from an experimental laboratory. After 12 months, there was no significant difference in efficacy between the two groups; however, it was evident that some potential progostic factors had been associated with improved outcomes."
31374820,"In this study, the effects of surface-treatments on bonding strength of Zircon to resin cement are compared. The results indicate that the best bond strength is obtained in the group S, with an initial value of 27.21 percent. Alumina-abrased surfaces improve the bonds between the two groups significantly. Bonding experiments are carried out using air-air-particles and different types of primers. After shear bond testing, all specimens are stored for 120 days before they are subjected again to failure mode evaluation. This time, however, no improvement is seen in both the effect of heat-reflective methods and the useof silica-coating."

24615862,"This study focuses on the effects of a six-week exercise program on biomechanical and physiological characteristics of manual wheelchair propulsion. The subjects were divided into four groups: 1) control group; 2) 50%-intense group, 3) 7-week wheelchair training program; 4) 70-percent-Integration group with no significant relation to muscle strength; and) n=15 untrained male subjects who did not participate in the trial. Although there is no improvement in performance from the first two groups, it is clear that the use of the IMT device may be beneficial for people with scI. In this paper, we discuss the results of three different types of physical training: endurance interval training, short-duration interval exercises, and intensity-repetition exercises. We conclude that these studies have been successful in improving health and fitness of patients with spinal cord injury."
25238582,"In this paper, we describe a treatment strategy for children with attention-disordered hyperactivity disorder. We compare the effects of two different approaches: 1) combined treatment and 2) medication management. Both groups show significant improvement in symptoms over time. The most common side effect is mild-too-moderate sleepiness. A doubleblind, placebo-control study shows that Clonidine extended-release tablet is safe and effective in treating patients with ADHD. Children with tic disorders are more likely to remit their disorder than those with no comorbity. This suggests that tics do not have an effect on ADHD outcomes. Sixteen boys with chronic tric disorder perform sleeve tasks at laboratory tests. They report improved performance when they receive either DMI or MPH. However, there is no difference in response time after receiving either drug. Furthermore, desipramin does not cause any changes in blood pressure or motor speed during the first week of treatment."
27512972,"Five patients died in the placebo-controlled group. In addition to improved left ventricular functions, pentoxylline significantly reduced the risk of death from heart disease and other cardiovascular events. The only markers that independently predict risk were high-sensitivity Crp, serum ammyloid A, interleuin-6, andsoluble intercellular attachment molecule type 1, sicam-1. This study was designed to assess the effect of PentoXifyllines on reduction of vascular inflammation as well as improve endotility function in patients with Type 2 diabetes. After 8 weeks, the mean absolute change in FMD was not significant; P = 0.05. We have performed a doubleblind trial to determine the antiproteinurc effects of penToxifyLline on improvement of transaminations and histologies in subjects with glomerulular diseases. At 6 month, TNF alpha levels were significantly lower than those of the control group: 2.1 vs 3.16 pg./ml, respectively, at six months. These results suggest that adding pen ToxifiesLine to fendibrate reduces the severity of acute coronary Syndromes by reducing the proinflammatory response observed among these patients."
29098982,"The results of the study suggest that adding vision-based measures to balance testing improves the detection abilities of current side line concussession assessment. Concusions are the most common traumatic brain injuries and result from impact or impulseive forces on the head, neck, or face. Aim To use the Kings-DevICK test and Sports Confussion Assessment Tool 2, in amateur rugby players over'domestic competition season' to identify witnessed but unwitnessable episodes of concusions that occurred from participating in competition games over three years. In this study, eye tracking is used as an additional measure of severity of obstrucssion. Eye tracking has been associated with trauma since ancient times; linesar regression analysis shows that three metrics -- horizontal disconjury, corroborated by SCAT3, and positively corroborated with total Stand and ardised Assessment of Concursation Score -- negatively correlated With Scat3 symptom score and positive  correlate with Total St and Ardized Assessment Of Concupsion Score. This study furthermore examines recovery time after conicsses for high school andcollegiate players. All players undergo preseason baseline tests on concoussed assessment measures in 2000, 2000, and 2001. Both groups report more symptoms on Post Traumatic Amnesia post-match than those who do not have concocted injury. Further studies are performed on two teams competing in an amateur Rugby League season. Two players reported longer K-d time scores incidentally during the matches. These results indicate that players may be at greater risk of delayed recovery when they suffer a sports related conscriptsion because of their higher levels of recent memory."
25429224,"In this study, we examine the risk of mortality after recurrent fractures in women and males. We find that there is an increased risk for death among patients with a single fracture during the age of 50 years or older. A prospective cohort study assesses the cost of hip-femoral injuries among Canadian adults aged 50 to 66 years. The results indicate that the annualized costs are lower than those reported in the literature. This study also determines whether bone mineral density, age, and smoking are associated with subsequent fracture within two years of initial fracture. It also predicts that men and women will have fewer complications from their fracture when compared to those who have no fracture at all."
21911628,"In this study, pharmacists and primary care physicians are able to improve blood pressure control for patients with uncontrollable hypertension in a community pharmacy setting. After six months of follow-up, the pharmacist group achieves better results than the control group. The outcome of this trial is that patients who receive pharmacist intervention have improved their overall BP controls. This suggests that there may be an alternative approach to treating hypertensives without risk of adverse events or medication errors. A pharmacist-led program has been shown to lead to greater reductions in blood flow in patients at higher risk for heart failure."
22748994,"In this paper, the failure and survival rate of orthodontic braces bonded using Self-etching Primer is compared with that of conventional bonding methods. Thirteen patients are selected for fixed appliance therapy and all treatment is performed by two operators. The results show that the self-etched primer has a higher failure rate than the conventional system. A single-centre trial is conducted to assess the safety of tooth-bonding systems based on an in-vivo study. Bonding times are calculated for each patient and then divided into three groups: ""patients who required upper or lower pre-applied edgewise fixed Appliances""; ""tooth position in the mouth"" and ""number of manipulations before curing the Adhesive."""
31230196,"Af-including specific biotics, which result in levels of ""bifidina and ery/cold"" approximing levels in the Hamilton-Breck group,"" improves the health of infants suspected of cow's milk disease. The diagnosis of Cma is made using a doubleblind, placebo-control food challenge. Feces collected from healthy breastfed children are used as reference for primary outcomes. In addition, the results of IgG-mediated CmacA are higher in both groups with respective geometric mean values 55 pg/g; n = 18. compared with those obtained by control group. At age 8 years, asthma, rhinoconjucciitis, and other sensitization were detected in patients with CMA following to school age. Babies who had been treated with Lactobacilus GG showed significant improvement in their growth during the study phase. This study further investigated whether or not an amino acid-containing formula could be effective in treating infant symptoms caused by cow dairy protein allergy. It was found that this formula improved the severity of food- related symptoms when randized at six months. However, it did not lead to long-term changes in body weight and height."
24338903,"A cross-over study comparing the effects of manual physical therapy and stretching on pain in patients with neck pain. The results are similar: pain is reduced by both groups at 8 weeks, but there is no difference in proportion or magnitude of fatigue loss between the two groups. In addition, early ergonomic intervention has been shown to prevent and restore self-re reported productivity loss associated With UED. This trial was designed to assess the efficaciousness of two different types of physical activity work site exercises against a reference exercise program. Muscle Strength increased approximately 10 percent compared with Ref, which resulted in significant reductions of Cardio and Metabolic Syndrome-related riskfactors as well as Neck pain symptoms. Cupping was found highly effective in treating carpal tunnel disease; it also showed improvement in grip strength and function. An interdisciplinary approach was used to determine whether an integrated health program would be more cost effective than regular physiotherapies. Return to work after an occupational injury may be beneficial for employers seeking to increase employee satisfaction and well being. Workers were divided into four groups: 1) work style group, 2) workstyle and physicalactivity group, 3) control group. After six months, body posture, workstation layout, and pain intensity were improved over time. Pain severity and disability were significantly reduced immediately after the intervention. No differences between these groups were observed in upper arm complaints, disability, quality of life, or health related qualityof life. Postural exercises delivery by Mensendingieck/Caresar did not seem to be better in decreasing pain, improving disability and improving healthy living in visual display units workers with early Non-specific Work-Relational Musculoskeleton Disorders among office workers. These studies examined the effectiveness from hypnotized vasodication in the treatment process of upper extremities repetitive strain injuries. It was concluded that this type of training could reduce pain and improve muscle activation within the neck and back muscles. However, the use of myofedback training led to improvements in shoulder pain during work hours. All three treatments showed similar pain relief upon follow-up."
21177660,"The association between low testosterone levels and risk of sudden death in older men was examined. Men with high levels were more likely to die than those with low levels, suggesting that elevated levels may lead to a greater risk for mortality. In this study, we examine the relationship between serum testosterone level and blood pressure and conclude that it is not associated with all-calus mortality in old men. We furthermore examine whether an elevated cortinsol-totestosteron ratio increases the risks of myochondriac disease."
19588396,"The results of a large number of published trials indicate that the experimental drug is recommended as treatment for choice in 16 percent of those funded by non-profit organizations, 30 p.m. studies not reporting funding, 35 pp. of trials not reporting funding and 51 y.o. trials with no reported funding. In this case, the study was conducted on 500 patients who had been depressed for 6 months. They were treated with an extended period of time to improve their quality of living. Although they did not experience any adverse events, they experienced significant improvement in their Quality of Life Scores. MilNacipran showed superior efficacy over fluvaxamine in treating Major Depressive disorder. Both treatments produced greater improvements on Hamilton Depression Rating scales than either regimend by placebo. A multicentre trial compared antidepressance and tolerance of two single doses of molybrinc or milnancipration in patients with major depressive disorders. This suggests that both drugs are highly effective in reducing depression."
21929322,"Strength does not vary between groups but is associated with the abilities to shift the central portion of the body in the anterior pose. Fearful of falling also relates to weight-shifting ability. This study examines balance ability, lower-limb muscle strength, fear of fall and their relationshipships in older adults. Seniors who self identify as being fearless offalling are screened to include those with known risks for falling. A high intensity functional exercise program improved balance, gaitability, and lower leg strength in elderly persons dependent in daily living and living in residence care facilities. At three month's time, the group had improved considerably in self-pace Gait Speed compared with control group; mean difference 0.05 m/d, t =.001. The results of this study indicate that there is no significant interaction between the exercise intervention and nutrition intervention. Reliative reliability might be reported as ""an Intrclass correlation coefficient"" or ""absolute reliability."" In terms of preventive measures such as falls prevention, it is suggested that subjects may have impaired balance at an early age because they do not report any physical or mental health problems. However, studies of testretest reliability have used different intervals between tests administrations. For example, one study uses two days and two weeks to compare scores on four knee-ringing scales and eight domains from the Sf-36 score. There was no statisticallysignificant differences in test-reject reliability for the two times intervalses. All patients were divided according to gender and age. Most substantial changes were estimated from a range of 0.08 to 1.34 point per week for gaits speed, short physical performance battery, 6 minute walk distance,and self measured mobility. Meta-Another study shows that people who did not complete the trial were less likely to suffer depressive symptoms than those who completed the other trials. These factors suggest that these characteristics at baseline may lead to dropout. Measurements Measurements of Demographics, Health, And Physical Performance included selfrated health : Self-Reported health -- SF- 36 -- Disease burden & adverse events -- PPT 8 ; MacArthur Battery -- 6-Minute Walk Distance -- and Self expressed mobility -- Gault Speed -- Short Physical Perspections -- SpPB -- 6, Mingle Walk Mileage -- Walking Speed Score -- Gauit Time and Number of Steps -- Stride length -- 63.2 %) and Ag"
26996098,"The effects of exercise in breast cancer are described. In particular, the results indicate that physical activity may be more beneficial in improving quality of life and fatigue than resistance or intensity exercise. Several studies have examined the effect of walking exercise on fatigue-regularity during treatment for acute myellogenous lesuicide patients. A three-week walk exercise program was shown to improve fatigue related experiences of acutemyelogened leukemia patients receiving chemotherapy. This study suggests that eight weeks of vigorous exercise training is feasible and may reduce fatigue and prevent further degradation in physical functioning after disease treatment. Women who attend 50 % of prescribed resistancetraining sessions have significantly better changes at maximal strength measures than those who do not adhere to the regimen. Furthermore, both groups report improved self-esteem, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and physical function. Two other studies suggest that an 8 week exercise intervention can help women with early stage breastcancer. These studies provide evidence that exercise therapy has significant short-term positive effects on health outcome in men with localized breastcarrying tumors. However, these studies cannot be used as controls because they are too young and socially advantaged to be considered valid."
15877905,"In this paper, we examine the effects of extended iron therapy on lower development scores in infant children with iron deficient anemia. The results suggest that iron treatment may improve learning and motor skills in anecdotes with a mixed group of anestmic and non-anemic patients. Iron treatment does not improve mental or motor performance in these groups; however, it does improve intelligence in some cases."
24769422,"This study focuses on the association between serum levels of 25H-hydroxyvindal D and risk for multiple scleroid disease. It is found that patients with higher levels have a lower risk of relapse, new lesions, and increased brain volume in the first three months of their disease course. In addition, patients who have low levels early in their illness are associated with an increased risk toward recurring musculosis."
28538328,"In this study, the authors develop a risk-response assessment tool to predict injury in military recruits. They find that men with high body mass and low physical activity are at greater risk for stress fracture than those with lower body weight. The results suggest that poor physical fitness is an important risk factor for overuse or acute injuries. Women who fail the step test have higher risk of stressfracture than women who do not pass the test. This study furthermore examines the relationship between player characteristics including age, playing experience, ethnicity, and physical exercise. Athletic training is mandatory for all male civilians and every year about 80 p.m. 19 years old men enter the service. Predicative associations between injuries were examined by multiplevariate cox's proportionalhazard models. Injury risk was odds ratio; OR = / injury severity; matches missed; rate ratio RR. A follow-up cohort study follows up on these studies to evaluate predictive relationships between injury risk and their intrinsic risk factors. For elite Australian football players, it is found that they have increased injury incidence in subjects with low body masses and poor performance. Men with history of inactivity had higher injury risks than other men. To determine intrinsicrisk factors, we measured three91 army recruit girls during eight weeks of air combat basic training. There were 113 injuries among 55 men and 86 women. These include smoking, excessive body fat, extreme high or low bodies mass index, low endurance level, as well as foot or knee hurt that limited activity. All men experienced one or two injuries during training but only half of them could be prevented from suffering another injury. Other factors included: smoking habit, aerobic fitness, prior injury, menstrually history, gender-specific prediction of lower extremities. After foot exams, shoe selections were selected according to plantar shape. Thus, running shoes were associated with reduced injury rates when compared to walking shoes. Furthermore, there was no association between upper-limb injuries and lower-arm injuries except for previous lower leg injury which was strongest predictor for lower arm injuries regardless of recall time."
25516002,"In this paper, we present the results of two different types of hip arthrostheses: 1) conventional polyethylene and 2) highly cross-linked Polyethylene. The first study compares the wear of both materials in patients with an initial follow-up period of 5.5 years. Both groups showed signs of Osteolysis at the end of the trial; however, the second study used a new type of bearing called ""ceramic."" This new device was more successful in terms of pain, function, and stiffness than either material. It also improved the patient's hospital score from 19.8 to 38. After five years, it was found that the duration system had better long-term results than conventionally crosslinked polypropylene."
30576798,"Statin therapy is associated with reduced short-term events and end point cardiac events. In this paper, we examine the effects of long term statin treatment on fasting lipids, lipophosphorylated cholesterol levels, highsensitivity C-Reactive Protein, and total antioxidant status in patients with severe acute coronary disease. The results are similar to those of other anti-inflammatory treatments such as simvastain or rosuvastin. We also assess the effect of short term regimens on blood flow, inflammation, cell wall integrity, TNF alpha, interleakin 6, and soluble VCAM-1. This study concludes that there is no significant difference in the baseline characteristics between these two groups. A parallel trial was conducted in which patients were given either 80 mg/ day of atorvarstatin at admission after an acute stroke or placebo for six weeks. These patients showed marked reductions in their serum markers of inflammation during the initial period of treatment. They also showed increased levels of MpP1 and SvCAM 1, but they did not show signs of any change in insulin resistance. Another study was performed whereby rats were fed fish oil instead of animal fat. It was found that animals had greater amounts of free fatty acids than humans; however, it was not clear whether this was due to the presence of glutathiamine or some other steroid."
23097268,"A randomized, double-blind study comparing the effects of an energy restriction diet on weight loss. The subjects lost more weight in the high protein group than in those with low-protein meals. In addition, they lost less body fat and improved their blood lipid profiles. Both groups showed greater reductions for total and lipoproteincholestic levels. They also demonstrated greater improvements in bone turnover and reduced blood pressure. This was followed by a comparison of two different diets to determine which one would be best for treating patients with Type 2 diabetes."
21684488,"A prospective, i.e. controlled study of elderly patients who have undisplaced Colles' fractures is presented. In this paper, we describe the early mobilisation and subsequent improvement of wrist function after six weeks of post-opportunity treatment. The results of an earlier trial suggest that early mobilizations are superior to conventional immobilation in terms of pain and improved grip strength. This paper also discusses the use of self-training as an aid in the treatment of patients with distal radius injuries. Although there are no significant differences between groups, it is reported that ""early mobilization"" is more effective than immediate physio therapy for these patients."
28143406,"In this study, we examine the effects of a daily dose of ascorbbic acid on the risk of atrial fillation after elective chest surgery in patients with chronic obstructive fever. We conclude by examining the effect of vitamin C on post-elective cabital grafting and its associated complications. Our results suggest that ascotbicacide may be more effective than placebo in preventing these events."
22162279,"In this paper, we present a double blinded study of the efficacy of custom-made foot orthoses for patients with recurrent arthritis. The results suggest that shorter disease duration is associated with greater improvements in pain and ability after treatment with these new post-opportunities. We also examine the effect of plantar pressure reduction on walking speed and gait when compared to unshaped or flat material. Aiming to balance internal validity and external validity between the two groups, our study compares the use of rigid foot posts to custom made shoe-only trials in patients suffering from rheusatoidic arthritis. Both groups showed significant reductions in both pain scores and ankle function at six months. However, there were no significant differences between group for disease activity either. This suggests that using custom designed footposts to correct deformed feet may be an effective strategy for relieving leg pain caused by RA."
23867029,"Danrehab's trial demonstrates that the combination of risk reduction and lifestyle changes can significantly reduce the risk of myomyocardial atherosclatorotic disease in men and women. The results are very favorable for both groups, especially for patients with angiographicly defined chest pain. In particular, the intervention group has a lower rate of death than the control group; however, there is no significant increase in the incidence of heart attack or stroke among the two groups. A further study suggests that patient education may be useful in preventing sudden death from acute myory infa-rct-ion or other complications."
27900447,"In this study, we examine the association between a diet pattern of sugarsweetened beverages and risk of heart disease. We conclude that consumption of these beverages is associated with increased risks of CHD as well as some adverse changes to lipids, inflammatoryfactors and leptose. This paper also uses sensitivity-spectroscopy to investigate the relationship between food habits and weight change in women. The results suggest that high-sugar sweetened drinks are more likely to cause Type 2 Diabetes than low- or no-Swedden beverages."
24985387,"A prospective cohort study comparing the performance of the five-m walk test with that of other measures in stroke rehabilitation. The results suggest that the 5m walking test is superior to the 10mwalk test for detecting changes in walking function in the first five weeks after stroke. In addition, the timed up and go test predicts falls for both patients with acute stroke and those with no previous fall. This study uses cut-off scores from the TUG and Go test to assess the risk of falls among frail older adults who are not at risk for falling."
26558538,"Meloxicam and pregabaline are more effective for pain than either group. Pain scores after 4 weeks are compared with those of the other two groups. In this study, patients who had previously failed to respond to the World Health Organization's ""step III"" or ""whole-hearted"" treatment of opioids were randomized to receive either tapentadasol or placebo. After a mean age of 61 years, 57 percent were female, and 82 % were White. This was an interesting study because it showed that duloxeten was safe and efficacious in treating knee pain."
22930416,"In this first study, we examine the safety and efficacy in a double blinded placebo-feedback intervention for children with ADHD. Parents report significant improvements in their child's symptoms after two weeks of EEG-Neurotraining. Children with both types of disorder are assigned to either group; however, previous studies have failed to control these confounding factors or do not employ reinforcement-controlled design. The treatment for both groupsconsists of 30 sessions. After six months, the results show no significant differences on repeated measures nor newly examined variables. A second study is performed to determine whether any long- term effects will be seen in the following years. This study compares the effect of hypnotism training with that of an electroderinated drug regimen. Both treatments result in improved performance on the tests of attention, impulse control, and processing speed. Brain Snack: neurofeed back has been used to treat patients with attention deficit disorder since it can improve brain function. However, there are some drawbacks because of the lack of specificity regarding the use of stimulant medication. For example, one study suggests that using Egbefback may be more effective than conventional therapy in treating adults with hypersensitivity."
26000442,"The aim of this study is to determine the effect of a combination of two drugs on patients with chronic myomyocardial failure. Both drugs reduce blood pressure and increase the change in procollagen Type I concentration from initial to final visit between these two groups. In addition, the reduction in blood-stained pressure is greater in the treatment group treated with either drug than in placebo. A double blinded crossover trial is carried out in 30 patients who have mild to moderate heart failure; they receive either fixed-dose or placebo for three weeks. After six weeks, both regimens produce significant reductions in their mean arterial pressure. They also show an increased level of serum urination. These results suggest that there may be some role for the secretion of ""kallikreine-kinin"" in antihypertinesive action."
17239674,"In this study, we report the results of a large-scale prospective observational study in which patients with late-venous thromboses were compared to those without aspirin resistance. The results suggest that aspidin resistance is associated with an elevated risk of death and myocardialty in follow-up. We further investigate the association between platelet function test results and aspin dose and severity of disease. Aiming to predict whether patients will respond to aspriin therapy, our group examined the response of patients who received only asprain as an agent for antiplatelet protection. Although there was no difference in patient sensitivity regarding age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, and other lipidemia, it was found that they were assensible at rest."
28455948,"This study focuses on the acceptability of short message services in patients with acute stroke. It is a blinded, single-centre superiority trial that compares the effects of long-term lifestyle reminders to standard medical care. The results indicate that this intervention will improve quality of life for patients who are at risk of sudden death from heart failure. In addition, it will reduce readmissions and increase patient satisfaction by improving physical activity."
31969830,"In this study, Wuthering Heights et al.1stood the benefits of strength training and exercise alone in patients with chronic claudicure. They found that they had significant improvements in walking time, blood flow, and oxygen consumption after 12 weeks; however, their results were not as promising as those obtained by resistance or aerobic training. The authors conclude that it is possible to use combined strength and endurance training to improve both physical and mental health in people with moderately ill heart disease."
11698781,"In this study, the effect of consumption of milk on the frequency and duration of acute opportune diarrhaea in children is investigated. The results indicate that Lactobacterus casei can reduce the severity of disease when compared to traditional dairy products. A double-blinded trial was conducted with 928 children over four months. Frequence or duration were determined; as far as frequency concerned there was no significant differences between the groups. There was also a significant difference in the incidence of DiarramhoeA being reduced by supplementing with Lactogenus strain DN-251 001. This study was aimed at determining if adding lactobacllus casesi strains GN to healthy children could affect the risk of an acute diarea episode. It was found that the use of LacTobacillus Casei's strain reduced both the length of diarrhea and the number of IgG secreting cell numbers during the acute period of the infection. Furthermore, specific immune responses to rotavior were endorsed, which is probably relevant in protection from reinfections. Shorter durations of diarchosis were observed in patients receiving LacTophilus G than in those receiving placebo. Children who had acute nonbloody disarray were considered more likely to be affected by the shorter duration for either treatment. When only one patient with acute bloody diarmy was considered, it was assumed that they would have been treated with L. acidphilus LB. Thus, infants fed breast milk were given two different regimens: 1) daily feeding without any intervention; and 2) twice daily giving up all fermented food. After six months, each regimen was followed by another month without further intervention. Each diet was divided according to the amount of time spent in rehidratation. At the end of every day, after five days of drinking, everyone received three meals. On the other hand, babies fed cow milk did not receive any change in their health."
27914601,"The results of this study suggest that a combination of exercise and education is effective in improving pain and function in older adults who have hip or knee osteoarthritis. This paper describes an experimental protocol for the PICO trial, which involves swimming and other forms of physical activity to improve symptoms and quality of Life in patients with hip/ knee Osteoartritis. Both groups show significant improvements in pain as well as improvement in functional performance. In addition, both groups demonstrate improved range of motion and improved health-related measures after six months of treatment."
25529265,"In this study, we find no significant differences between the eight weeks of exercise and advice for patients with back pain. We conclude that there are no negative side effects from supervised walking or advice to stay active in chronic low-back pain patients. The Arthritas, Diet, and Athletic Promotion Trial is a double-blind, random-experimental study designed to determine whether short-term exercise combined with weight loss is more effective than usual care for improving physical function, pain, quality of living, depression, anxiety, etc. After 18 months, the results are not statistically significant. However, there may be some clinical programs that provide generally available tools, such as an uploading walk goal, feedback, motivational message,and social support. This study was based on case-control studies. It found that walking improved both functional status and pain in older adults who had knee osteoarthritis. Walking also improved self-reported disability in those with knee Osteoartritis."
28150351,"Atherosis Risk in Communities In this study, we examine the effect of adrenched magnesium on blood pressure, lipids, and cell function in subjects with Type 2 diabetes. The results indicate that high-molecular-mg salts can be used as an effective treatment for type 2 patients without significant side-effects. We also find that there are no significant changes in glucose control or hba1c levels in patients with hypomagnessemia. This is due to the fact that they do not have sufficient glutoninity to counteract the effects of other antidepressant drugs."
28589547,"In this study, we investigate the effects of physical activity on patients with non-smal cell lung cancer. We find that patients in the treatment group have a shorter length of stay and more complications than those who do not receive any physical therapy. This is due to the independent risk factors for late deaths associated with postoperative pulmonectomy. A prospective observational study has been carried out on 234 patients following lung surgery over 13 months. The results indicate that all patients had evidence of pcocy at diagnosis. There was no significant difference between groups for long-term outcomes. After resection, patients received daily breathing physiotherapy until discharge."

Furthermore, there was no difference between the American Society's classification for anesthesies physicians in both groups. After two years, 284 patients have been enrolled in 30 high volume schools. There is no evidence that conservative treatment of such a large patient group will save lives."
25358395,"In this study, we examine the effects of dieting and exercise on leptoprotein concentrations in older adults with metabolic syndrome. We conclude that a diet-induced loss of weight leads to improvements in physical function, pain, and mobility as well as changes in body composition and fat mass. The Arthritis, Diet, And Activity Promotion Trial is an 18-month, double-blind, prospective study designed to determine whether short-term exercise or 'diet plus exercise' are more effective than usual care for improving health in overweight and obese patients with knee osteoartis. This trial results in significant improvements over two years in both self-reported physical functions and improvement in waist circumferential measurements. Both groups lose weight at the end of the treatment period. However, they do not show any change in blood pressure or lipoprotein content. Two other studies suggest that adding exercise to one's diet may reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes. These studies confirm our previous findings about the beneficial effects from exercise alone or by combined diet and activity."
21757258,"In this study, we evaluate the safety of enzalutemide in patients with castrated-resistant prostatecancer after treatment. The results suggest that a shorter time to testosterone recover is associated with lower risk of dying than those who receive immediate adjuvant therapy. A further study confirms our earlier observation that an extended time for testosterone recovery may lead to reduced risks of death. This was confirmed in vivo men with staged D2 disease treated with rogenpriming. After three months, no significant differences in the two- and 5-year BCR free survival rates were observed. In addition, there were no differences between the 2 and 5 year follow-up periods. Prostate- specific antigen levels were reported as ""new lesions"" or ""no new lessions."" There were also no changes in pain at month 3, but not thereafter. Urological symptoms were improved by daily doses of Casoldex. Physicians with advanced disease were treated for 12 weeks with 10-25mg per day. They had better overall survival when compared with other treatments. Salvageradiation was also found to be more effective in improving PSA level, pain, quality of life, and pathological stage. Men received immediate abduction therapy within 24 days of their primary prostatectomy because they did not have enough time before becomingsymptomatic. However, these studies showed that immediate Abduction could extend survival in men without negative lymph nodes."

9876364,"The authors evaluate a six session Interactive Computer Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment program given to volunteers who met the RDC for Major or Minor depressive disorder. After treatment, and at two month follow-up, both treatment group had improved significantly than control subjects on the Beck depression Inventory, SCL90-R Depression and Global scales, Hamilton Rating Score for depression,and Automatic Thought Question naire. Both treatment groups do not differ from one another at either time views of use favored decision supports as 'a concept, but criticized technical problems with it'. In this study, physicians are assigned to either an outpatient or nurse-practitioner practice in order to have their records held in DSS; however, no patients receive any additional information about their symptoms or diagnoses. This study is designed to assess the efficacy of using ""a computerised decision support system"" for hypertension management. It was found that there were no significant changes in blood pressure control between the two practices. However, the attempts to tailor the system to help doctors using it made the systems acceptable to the doctor using its. For the patient population, all three practices received either physician feedback or the education program over the study term. All three groups showed improvement during the period of the trial. Physicians reported better results on content-specific post intervention test: mean score 80 per cent vs 74 percent for the control condition. Nurses sent reminders to patients by telephone after they had been seen having lowered their blood flow. A comparison of three different methods of encouraging patients to obtain reassurance concerning their health was made. One hundred and 16 patients with hypertensity were allocated b and olymically to treatment by either medical technology or by physicians"
26772769,"This study demonstrates that the use of telemedicine to improve care for patients with Type 2 diabetes is cost-effective and can lead to improved health outcomes. In addition, it reduces costs by reducing the need for frequent physician visits. The results suggest that a standardized, evidence-based approach to care may be more cost effective than an outpatient intervention."
31182100,"The Heart exercise and remote technologies intervention is a novel approach to improving physical activity in patients with acute coronary disease who receive short message service, either via short messages or through phone only. Although significant treatment effects are observed for primary outcomes, such as leisure time physical activities, there is no difference in the relative efficacy of the intervention. In addition, it has been reported that an ""electrified"" group of patients may be able to use this program to improve their health. This study compares the effectiveness of an e-mail-based heart exercise program with traditional care in terms of improvement in blood lipid levels, body mass index, and self-efficiecacy. A substudy of another trial investigates whether telemonitors can help prevent myomyocardial arrhythmias by relieving the need for frequent visits to the emergency department. It was found that these measures were not sufficient to reduce the risk of sudden death among patients receiving conventional care."
25335444,"In this study, we examine the effects of zinc on weight gain and growth in children from a low-society school. The results suggest that zinc may counter age-related declines in muAC observed in pre-school children in developed countries. Children aged 55. 8 years old were divided into three groups: one group was assigned to receive 6 mo of Zn; another group received only 3 mo. After six mo, the proportion of children who did not lose their weight or gain their height increased by 57 p.m. in the Zg group, 46 pp. A group consisted of 153 children with an average height of 50.8 mm. This study examined the effect of daily zinc treatment on growth and body composition in healthy adults. Young children had greater height attainment after 1 year than control children. However, there was no significant difference in mean height velocity between the two groups. For example, boys with lower height scores showed greater gains in height during the first 2 months of the intervention. Another study investigated the impact of adding zinc to children's diets for physical growth. Preparations for child growth disorder were conducted in Mexico. Two different groups of young children were given either 10 mg ZN as zincmethionine, 20 mg F as ferrous Sulfate, or placebo. Both groups reduced morbidities but had little effect on increases in growth or bodies composition. They also had less episodes of disease except for diarrhea. When they took zinc, blood levels increased significantly. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, and serum zinc concentrations improved. At the conclusion of post-supplements observation period, upper respiratory tract secretsions were the same in neither group."

In particular, the treatment results in significant reductions in pain intensity and scores for pain severity at five minutes after the first intervention. This suggests that using moxibution at this point can immediately improve blood flow to the uterine vessels of patients suffering from primary dysmenorrhea. Although no adverse events are reported from the study, it is suggested that needling on this spot can be used as an effective treatment."
23543544,"In this study, infants are compared to their breast-fed counterparts in terms of stool composition. The control group has hard stools and more soft ones than the experimental group; however, they do not show any differences in growth or weight gain. A total number of eighty babies continue the study until 6 months of age. Pregnant women are given three g of GOS/LcFOS from week 25 for gestation until birth. Babies with an impaired gut wall function are also studied. Infants receive either a formula consisting of Lactobacilus paracasius or BifiDobacterium laccai sp. At two months' time, newborns have no signs of serious infection. After six months, all infant groups have reduced outbreaks of infectious disease. Both groups use prebiotics that contain galactologosacchardes as echinotic ingredients. However, both groups exhibit significant reductions on the frequency of episodes of fever during the first year after birth: one group is treated with bovinelactoferin, while the other contains glutamine. These results suggest that probiotic treatment may help to reduce the morbidity caused by intestinal inflammation."

30788262,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates the beneficial effects of physical activity on older people's health by comparing resistance training to aerobic training. The results indicate that exercise training is more effective in improving physical function and mental health than other forms of exercise. After six months, the quality of their lives declines among the two groups. For example, between three and nine months they continue training with different frequency. Between three-and-9 months there is no significant difference in the outcome for either group; however, after 12 weeks, it is evident that the effect of strength training was not as strong as expected. This study uses telemedicine to assess the effectiveness of a weight-loss program on the improvement of body composition and performance in older women who are at risk of falls. It is concluded that balance training improves walking selfefficacy and reduces the incidence of falling in postmenostopausals. A second round of studies has been performed on elderly patients with Type 2 diabetes. Both groups have improved their functional performance and reduced mortality. However, both groups do not show any change in psychological or physical health."
11279717,"The aim of this study is to determine whether the use of a self-controlled, patient-centered approach to treating patients with Type 1 diabetes can be used to improve blood glucose control in patients who are not yet well educated about their disease. In addition, it is shown that improved blood pressure and body weight are associated with improved quality of care. A system of ""quality circles"" was developed to help manage patients' health by educating them on how to recognize and respond to changes in their blood sugar levels. This program has been studied in Germany and other European countries. It is reported that there is an improvement in both physical and mental health for people with type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. However, these studies do not show any significant change in either condition."
19588334,"This paper focuses on the effects of high intensity progressive resistive training on balance ability, lower extremity muscle strength, and fear of falling in older adults. It also examines whether progressive resistance training can improve depressive symptoms in elderly patients. The results indicate that vigorous exercise is more effective than low intensity or general care by relieving depressed symptoms as well as improving health-related functions. In this study, subjects were divided into two groups: one group was assigned to moderate intensity exercises and the other to an educational control condition. After six months, all subjects improved their functional performance with either program. A population-based, randomized, controlled trial was conducted; it examined the effect upon heart rate variability, muscular power, body composition, resting metabolic rates, weight loss, bone mineral content, fat mass, function, quality of living, gait velocity, walking speed, chair rise time, knee extension, stiffness, ankle moment, pain scores, physical function measures, self-repair test, fatigue score, waist circumference measure, blood pressure measurements, sleep quality assessment, etc. These studies suggest that resistancetraining may be useful for older people who have limited mobility and are not dependent on regular medical care."
27631314,"The eras-proposal has been used for eight years to improve the outcome of patients with colonosctal disease. In this paper, we report that 816 patients have been enrolled in the study. There are no mortalities and only postoperative items were predictive for shorter time of stay. A mean adherence rate of 73 percent was achieved in 2006 and 7 % in 2007 and 66 p.m. in 2008 and 2011 ; a mean readmission rate was 92 %) in 2012 and 2013. This is an important finding because it suggests that improvement in patient follow-up can be made by using specific measures. Fast track surgery leads to better control of pain and faster recovery of functions. After 1.3 days, there were no deaths or readmitted within thirty days. Postoperative symptoms were also similar between groups: consumption ofopiates during the first 3 posturgi days. An intrathecal mixed mixture of bopivacaine/morphine compared with systemsic morphines had less quality of postoral analgesis and other outcomes on the context of enhanced recovery after surgical procedures. The overall survival rates at three years were very similar among the two groups -- 86 percent laparoscopic assisted colectomy group and 80 percent open coclusion group. However, the risk ratio for death did not differ from those in both groups. Time to mobilisation, restoringof bowel function, and complete Oral feeding were considerably shorter with fast track protocol. Although the incidence of complications does not significantly differ between these groups, they must be further confirmed with powered multi-centre national studies."
28699541,"In this paper, we present the results of a community-led dengue control trial in two countries: Mexico and Nicaragua. We examine the impact of community mobilization on household health while comparing the costs of the intervention to that of routine household water supply. The results suggest that community mobilisation can be more cost effective than conventional approaches because it involves community volunteers, home-to-home visits, and use of evidence from the communities itself. This study also addresses issues of cost and replication. It is reported that Camino verde, an evidence-based community mobilization tool, has been successful in three countries; however, there are still concerns about its efficacy in terms of reduction of disease in households with regular water supplies."

21991471,"In this paper, the authors present a revised version of the Consolr statement on reporting of randomised controlled trials. The results of both treatment regimens are described in terms of their efficacy and safety. For example, Vitapex's success rate is 78 p.m. for primary teeth with no signs of disease or infection at 6 months; however, it is not clear whether the patient will return for follow up."
27510030,"This paper focuses on the effects of one-to-one educational intervention on private pharmacists' practice in low- income countries. It is concluded that government regulation has probably been important factor behind service quality improvements, but it is not yet clear whether these activities are effective or not. In this paper, we examine the effect of an education-based approach on improving private pharmacy practices in Kibahi district in Tanzaniaania. The results suggest that health workers who receive training plus study support perform better than those who do not receive such supports. We conclude that family planning services can improve care for children in poor and middle-poor countries because there is evidence that they are more likely to be informed about contraceptives when they attend roundtable meetings. A cluster-regular and Omized trial using rapid diagnostic tests was conducted in registered drug stores in Uganda and a country with high levels of malaria control. These results indicate that providing rapid diagnoses for malaria reduces dispensing antimalariums to patients unvaccinated by malaria; however, no safety concerns were found. Small scale interventions on training physicians on malaria treatment improvement over the counter medicine use but little evidence on efficacy when scale up. Nigeria has very high rates of sexually transmissible diseases and an increasing epidemic of HIV infection. Prescription Of Act by physicians may also impact upon the duration and frequency of STD cases. Therefore, various methods will be used to assess the success of multi-compartment intervention regarding knowledge and reported behavior amongst employees working in private drugs shops in Hanoi concerning four conditions: acute respiratory infection, diarrhaea, acute fever, and non prescription requests for medicines. They focus on each condition and are in sequence: regulations enforcement; face-To-face education; and peer influence."
19821388,"The effects of supervised exercise on patients with mild-to-medium disease are described in this paper. In the treatment group, muscle strength and endurance gains are more rapid than those in the control groups; however, both groups lose their ability to maintain their normal physical activities after two years of vigorous exercise. A second study is performed on women with early-onset or long-time RA. Both groups show significant improvements in muscular function during the first six months of the training program. However, they do not show any changes in bone mineral denition at all. This study concludes that ""dynamic strength training"" may be beneficial for patients who have recently gotten their first round of antirheumatic medication."
19076553,"The effect of a four-weekally enriched diet on insulin sensitivity was studied in patients with Type 2 diabetes. In the control group, there were no changes in plasma and internal cell concentrations; however, in the diabetic subjects with peripheral nervepathy, they had significant decreases in their serum glutamic levels. A double-blinded placebo-control trial was performed to investigate the effects of soyphosphorylation on blood pressure interval duration in people with ""type 2"" type II. After two weeks, both groups showed similar changes as measured by the time of each visit. Both groups also showed improved markers of pancreatinemia. Two studies have shown that alpha-chlorium can improve blood sugar concentration but have failed to show any beneficial effect on platelet activity. Another study has been conducted to determine whether vitamin E can be used as an anti-oxidative stress agent in type 2Did not change blood lipid content or other measures of inflammation. However, this study does not prove sufficient for further research."
24621460,"This study focuses on the effects of vigorous exercise on children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Forty patients were assigned into two groups, one group led by a physician and the other by an unnamed control group. The results showed that both groups improved their performance on measures of executive function. In particular, the intervention group showed improvements in short-term memory and response time. However, there was no significant change in overall performance between the two treatment groups."

In this paper, Anderson and colleagues report that only average strain is associated with revoked febrile after an ablation procedure. They conclude that ""lower sytolic strain was strongly association with relurence after catheter Ablation"". Furthermore, they find that the function of the left atrium is superior to that of other conventional measures of its function for prediction of future events."

The results of two different surgical techniques for the treatment of Ostearthrosis in the thumb were compared. Both procedures improved pain relief, patient satisfaction, mobility, Dash-score,key pinch force and grasping force. A prospective cohort study was conducted to compare changes in patients' health state over the durationof their hospital stay. In this study, older adults were divided into two groups: one group with early mobilisation at one or four weeks after surgery; the other group consisted of patients who had previously undergone trapezium excision. This study investigated whether patients gave consideration to an stand and ard quality of life assessment and whether consideration is changed by good and poor disease state descripters. It was found that patients did not consider either the best health vass anchor or the good health states as well as the self-reported change on the mini-mentalstate examination. Although there were differences in severity of disease, pre-operative characteristics, severity levels, and post-opportunity measurements, both groups showed significant improvement in function. Trapziectomy was performed in 41 patients with osteoarthroses of the trapezeometa carpal joint. There were no complications except for scar-related complications three times more commonly in posterior approaches. Forty-3 patients were assigned to undergo either trampeziectomy alone or with Ligand Reconstruction and Tendon Interposition using an abducted pollicis Longus tendon Slip. No significant differences between these two treatment groups were found. Simple trapeazaectomy is an efficacious operation for Ostensies at the base but the addition of ligament reconstructors was not seen to confer any further benefit"
16720668,"The effects of te on 13 healthy men with low or borderly low levels of serum T were studied. After 3 months, the urinary deoxipyridin Oline increased significantly compared to baseline in both groups but was not significant reduced by the placebo group. Men who received placebo showed no change in bone mineral density or quality of life. Both treatments seemed to be effective for relieving bone loss and improving muscle mass. In addition, they demonstrated gains in hip and total body mass when a combination of two-and-rogens, testosterone, and an analogous n androlone were used. They also showed increases in muscle strength and bone Mineral Density as well as improvements in qualityof life after 12 months. Long- term glucocolticoidic therapy in men seems to have repercussions on bone growth and decrease in serum testosterone concentration. A study comparing hip fractures among patients with normal gonadal functions found no effect on disease activity. However, it was noted that lower concentrations of testing did lead to greater bone turnover. This study suggests that there may be some role for testosterone in treating hypogonadasm."

In this trial, we assess the effect of high doses and long-term treatment on disease severity and improvement in host immune function. We conclude that adequate levels of blood-choleraemia are associated with improved health and reduced morbidity in acutely ill TB patients."
24465519,"In this first pilot study, we examine the efficacy of a group-based intervention for children with anxiety disorder. We find that the intervention is highly effective in improving overall functioning and severity of primary anxiety diagnoses after three months. Children with high-functionalitying anxiety disorders were randoed to group CBT/treatment-asusual or waitlist condition. Results showed markedly better results for the Cbt group. However, limited sample size and lack of attention control groups are limitations of this study. The effect of Cognitive Behavior therapy on parents' reported anxiety symptoms was superior to those of placebo. A second study examined the reliability and validity of the Self-report Question-Revized Score for child Anxiety-related Emotional Distress: Revised ; it was used to assess the predictability and validity of an assessment instrument for measuring anxiety in children. This study also uses the ScreeD-R as an instrument to compare the effects of two different treatment approaches on children who had been identified as having anxiety. Both treatments showed significant reductions in generalized anxiety at three and six months follow-up."

A double blinded test was performed to determine the effect of two different types of creams on the severity of skin deterioration after four weeks of treatment. Both were found to be effective. In particular, they showed significant improvement in the condition of dryness during the second and fourth week of treatments. However, there was little difference between the two groups in terms of their efficiacy. This study also included reevals of both groups at different time intervals. There was no significant difference in either group in regards to the extent of improvement. Although it was not possible to predict the exact cause of the change in patient's condition, we do know that some patients had an adverse event when they first started treatment; other patients did not."
27655114,"The effects of rogen replacement therapy on men with a history of atheomatous plaque are described. In this study, the effect of T-replacement is shown to be beneficial in improving symptoms of overt artery disease. A double blinded placebo controlled trial was performed in 27 men aged 62 and 9 years old who were deficient in their testosterone levels. Both groups showed significant improvements in leg press strength as well as improvement in quality of life. Short-term treatment of testosterone improves exercise-induced heart failure in patients with coronary diseases. Men with low serum testosterone levels show no change in physical function or mood. However, they do show some changes in sexual behavior. They also show an increase in scores on psychological tests such as the Beck depression inventory. These studies suggest that short-lived doses of synthetic testosterone may have some positive effects on mental health."
19346937,"In this study, Wu et al.1recently published in JAMA, found that there was no overall significant association between the adenocasculosis and dietary levels of calcium or vitamin D during the early years of life. The results suggest that it is not necessary for breast-fed children to receive sufficient amounts of these two nutrients as they are associated with lower risk of developing certain types of malignancies. Adenomatous Polyp Recurring occurs in 754 women in 1905. This finding supports the conclusion that daily supplemental doses of both mineral and fat may be beneficial in preventing breast cancer."
29620793,"A meta-analysis of 370 randomized drug trials is performed to determine whether or not there is an association between the funding and conclusions of these studies. The results indicate that both drugs are safe and efficacious in the short period of time. In addition, patients with panic disorders receive better treatment than those who do not have symptoms. Alprasolam improves their symptoms by week 1, while imipramine increases their effects by weeks 4; however, it does not lead to significant improvements in quality of life. Two different antidepressers, sertraline H and buspirone, are also studied in this study. Although they are more potent than placebo, they fail to produce any significant improvement in severity or frequency of panic attacks. This paper reports on a multi-site trial of 1146 patients suffering from panic disorder who met DSMIII-R requirements for panic disorder. They were assigned either alprazolram or imipromine at the beginning of the trial. Both treatments showed no significant difference in response to measures of severity except for the Panic Attack Score which was calculated as percentile changes rather than numeric changes. However, when the patient's condition worsened during the initial phase of treatment, neither medication nor dose increase was noticed. Thus, although side effects may be present, physicians must take into account compliance, safety, andefficacy in every patient under treatment."
23314270,"The effect of a community-based intervention on bone mineral density in postmenstrual women was examined. In the intervention group, changes in parathyroid Hormone and anthropometry were not significantly different from those in control groups. However, there was no significant difference in hip bone mass between the two groups; this study concludes that ""individualized basal bone denition combined with minimal educational intervention"" is more effective at preventing hip fracture than does standardized exercise."
24567582,"In both groups, the risk of heart attack decreases significantly after one-year of treatment by nurse nurses. Men aged 50-75 years old without a past history of disease or diabetes are not included in this study. The number of patients visits is higher and visits take more time than that of the intervention group. Mortality is considerably higher among those who do not participate in the trial. This paper describes the prevalence of certain cardiovascular risk factor in British general practices and in sub-groups with reports of hypertension, hypercholestrerolaemia, diabetes and chest disease. Aim The purpose of this paper was to describe the proportion of cardiovascularrisk factors in households screened systematically by nurses; in particular, in families whose blood pressure was greater than 180 mmHhg, men and women had no knowledge of high blood tension. Outcomes Measurred Cardiovascular Risk Score, body mass Index, bloodpressure, serumlipid levels, carbonmonoxide in experiatory air, and tobaccouse. No significant change from satisfaction with life or emotional well being due to screening could be detected but clinicians should bear in mind that encouraging patients ""to change life style"" may lead to patient reminders of diseases and dissatifaction with themselves"
28265017,"Dabigaran is a better antithrombot than warfarin, with lower risk of stroke or major bleeding. The primary end point for the treatment of patients with atrium fibrillation was stroke; in this case, it was edoxanaban. Af-time-resemblances between body size and weight change were observed in Japanese patients who had atrial fibrilation. In addition, they showed reduced rates of major blood loss as compared to those with normal body weight. Obesese patients have better long term outcomes than other patients. Body mass Index and waist circumference were positively associated With atary fibriliation. Overweight patients had lower cardiovascular deaths as well as less death from any causes. Physicians followed up on patients after 4 years. They found that there was no difference in risk among different types of disease. Atrial Fibrillation occurred in an epidemic proportion. It was reported that obesity conferred greater risk for development of systemic embolism but did not lead to fatalities."
24788950,"This study focuses on the relationship between physical exercise and risk factors for adulthood. In general, men and women in the low-body mass group have lower blood pressure, fasting body fat, and metabolic syndrome scores than those in high-BMI groups. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of how young adults may be at risk for cardiovascular disease. Physical activity is also strongly correlated toward childhood obesity. Children aged 10 to 12 years old from San Juan are included. They receive no physical education during their first two semesters but do improve their health by improving bone mass and mineral content. Power PE is an eight-week program that uses principles of effective Bone loading to practical opportunity to improve lifelong muscleoskeletal outcomes. It was found that children with higher waist circumference had greater resistance to injury than children without. A comparison between height and body mass index indicates that there is a significant association between strength and weight in overweight children."

The results suggest that consuming rsverartrol alone has no significant effect on the postpran and ieal inflammation response in patients with obesity. A double blind, cross-over, truncking, placebo-control study was performed to assess the safety and efficacy for enacting an orlistrat-reseratol combination in overweight men. After seven visits, weight loss was observed in both groups."
24933494,"In this study, we examine the effects of a pharmacist's home blood pressure-monitoring program on patients with uncontrollable hypertension. The results are quite different from those obtained in other studies. For example, there is no significant difference between group differences for total cholesterol, lipoprotein, and low density lipostic cholesterol. A nurse-led regimen improves control of both disease severity and patient satisfaction. This intervention also reduces the risk of developing heart disease among African Americans. Although home care nurses are unique in their ability to help vulnerable people manage their blood tension, they have not yet been successful in treating these patients. These include telephony nursed disease management, an eight-week behavior-based intervention for improving bloodpressure control among elderly American patients who are at least moderately high risk for developing cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, several studies have shown that physicians can improve quality of care by using evidence-base approaches to predict changes in health status over time. One such study has found that doctors can be more effective when they use case management strategies to improve treatment of patients suffering from chronic disease. Another study suggests that physician-patient teamwork may be useful in controlling hypertensives. It was reported that many patients had poor blood flow control but did not show any improvement in either control or outcome after one year. Finally, another study describes the effectiveness of ""an integrated care intervention"" designed to increase blood pump control in older adults with mild to middle-aged diastonic hyperstensiveness."
16151686,"This study focuses on the cost and quality of anaesthesia for patients undergoing open laparoscopic surgical procedures. It is shown that there are no significant differences amongst the two groups, but pain scores are significantly lower in both groups. In contrast, buprenophine is more effective than morphine during the first 48 hours after surgery. The results of this study indicate that gasless and high-pressure methods have similar effects on pain. A quality manual is written to describe the process of these two different methods. An acute pain service is used to assess pain severity by a scale and then to evaluate the effect of local analgesis on relief. Postoperative knee pain is evaluated in three groups: group 1 receives lumbar or intrathecal epidural solution; group 2 receive codeine tablet; and group 3 receive either bolus or continuous infusion. After elective choecystentectomy, carbon dioxide remains inside the peritoleal cavity, commonly responsible for pain. There is no difference in posturgital pain intensity between the treatment groups except for the size of the posterior port. Pain scores at the subumbilical 10mm port are higher than those at other port sites. These results suggest that it is possible to reduce shoulder pain with greater ventilation."
31867068,"This paper describes a systematic, rigorous review of the evidence for physical therapy in older adults. It is important to note that there are few published trials available in this setting; therefore, it is necessary to read reviews that summarize the entire literature. In this paper, we describe the process that was used to conduct scientific review, which includes: establishment and comprehensive search / appraisal of all included studies - data extraction and Meta analysis & consideration ofthe clinical and research implications s of these findings. The results of exercise training were investigated in 48 elderly people who were assigned to either high intensity or low intensity resistance training with no particular exercise program. They showed improvement in arm strength, shoulderflexion, daily living activities, and quality of Life. Age-relational declines in physically and bodily function lead to increase risk of losing independence and poorquality of life. A study was designed to determine whether an extended outpatient regimen of balance and strength exercises improves physical functions and reduces the rate of fall among frail elderly subjects with hip fracture. Twenty-five elderly patients aged 70 years old were recruited from veteran's affairs and general practice bases. There was significant change in muscle power and performance in the intervention group as well as changes in functional outcome measures. Both groups showed improvements in gait, balance, health status, fall risk, etc. However, they did not show any difference in their scores on the short physical performance battery. These results suggest that endurance training can be more effective in improving physical function than home exercise. Back pain and injury related to falls were also studied. All three different types of groupbased exercise programs reduced back pain but only resistancetraining and agility training increased health-related qualities of live in communitydwelling elders with low bone Mass. future studies may want to use individuated qualityof life measures to progress delineate how different type of activity affects body mass."
25917824,"This study focuses on the reliability of posture measures among patients with idicated scolioliosis. The results indicate that there is no significant difference between the patient's characteristics and those of controls. A further study is presented in this paper to determine the relationship between clinical and laboratory-based measures of lumbar, thigh, and shoulder axes. In this study, the authors use a new approach to predict the position and range of the torso and spine in young dyphilis patients. They conclude that this new technology will reduce the costs of school screening and prevent unnecessary exposure to these patients"
28328940,"This paper describes a large scale, conditional Cash transfer program in Mexico that is associated with improved maternal health. The results suggest that the program can be used to reduce maternal death by improving access to quality care and reduced costs. In addition, it has been found that pregnant women who receive cash transfers are more likely to have higher birth weights than those who do not receive them. Furthermore, this study suggests that there may be an advantage in using the voucher scheme to increase delivery rates among poor women. Women who received the gift in 2009 or were sold on vouchers during the period of the trial were much less likely for their mothers to attend ante- and post-natal visits as well as to deliver in ancillary services. These women also had greater odds of receiving facility-based nursing services when compared to other women at the same time. A pretest/posttest analysis was performed to assess the effect of these changes on ANC, PNC, and institution delivery. Although there was no concluding evidence against the use of such schemes, further studies are needed to determine whether they will improve maternal outcomes."

22907552,"This study focuses on the association of blood pressure and the National Cholsterol Education Program's cholesterol categorical risk score with coronary disease. The results suggest that this approach may be superior to other approaches, particularly in predicting risk for patients with high-risk conditions. In addition, it is possible that smoking and blood-cholesterol levels may reduce the risk of heart attack in certain sub-sets of the population."
23461747,"The aim of the present study was to compare the mean bucca, mean tongue and overall mean sog dimensions at pre- and post-surgery. The results showed significant differences for all comparisons except for the difference in mean size between baseline and 6 months. Poor oral health before treatment and/or plaque also were related to sulculcular bleeding. Conclusive analysis was performed on a prospective cohort of 240 patients treated with metal crowns. At three and six months, the biological width was smaller than the previous two months; however, this was not due to the presence of an extra millimeter of bone removed during the surgery. In addition, there was no change in the papillary blood count after the surgical crown lengthened."
20585256,"In this study, we assess the association between stand and arduousness in older women. We find that they are more likely to fall than other risk factors such as unintentionally weight loss, weakness, poor energy, slow walking speeds, and lower physical activity. This study is a population-based study designed to determine whether or not an ""ardual"" frailtiness is associated with risks of adverse health outcome in elderly people. It was found that there were three or more common riskfactors for falls: age; poor mental state; and posturinal hypotension. The most important risk factor for falling was immediate memory, which showed to be independent risk predictor for both physical and mental functions. A follow up on the numberof falls and fractureses was conducted during one year period using fall surveys that participants filled into weekly schedules. After observing the frequency of falls among community-dwelinging volunteers aged sixty-93 years, it was concluded that 47 % experienced recurrentfalls at least once after adjusting for Age and interdependency of twin sisters. Men with low levels of testosterone were also significantly higher risk of falling because of their greater visual sensitivity and coexisting hearing difficulties. They also had increased risk for frequent falls when compared to men who fell only twice during the followup year. These results suggest that some measures of physical function may increase the risk from falls. Women with high levels but no alcohol use or pain were particularly strongly associated by falls due to their lack of exercise. Fallers were especially susceptible to these two types of injuries since they had previous history of fallen, self-preceived movement problem, knee extension strength, total mobility score, etc. Furthermore, drinking was associated greatly with increases in the likelihood of having recurring falls even though all six risk elements were present. Finally, our study concludes that long sleep and regular napping are highly risky for those with chronic pain. Our study furthermore confirms the multiplecausity of accidents since medical, psychological, sensorial, postural controls as well asphysical variables provide 'a predictive value'."
30830664,"Preterm infants, regardless of their caffeine status, are at high risk for sleep-absorption and limb movements. In this study, we examine the effects of cycled lighting on sleeping behavior in preterm babies. We find that children with very early births have higher risk of sleepwalking and crying than those with older children. A recent observational study investigates the effect of spontaneous light variations on night-time sleep behavior. The results indicate that there is a significant increase in the frequency of both sleepwalkers and nesting periods during these two types of care. Although it is not known whether these changes are associated with specific risk factors, several studies have suggested that they may be caused by systemic inflammation or by social class. This study furthermore suggests that an intervention to improve sleep can lead to improved brain development."
25411286,"In this study, we examine the effects of probiotic treatment on infants with low birth weight. We found that they had a reduced amount of fungal coloniation in the skin and stool, less time spent in hospital, and no significant difference in duration of hospital stays. The main outcome was reduction of enteral Fungal Colization. Probiotics were used to prevent necrotizing Enterocolitis due to their positive effects upon intestinal motor function, modulationof inflammatory response,and mucosalsal barrier function. A double blinded placebo-controlled trial was performed in which preterm children were divided into three groups: one group was given Lactobacilus casei, another group with Lhamnosus, then the other without any supplementation. Both groups showed an improvement in gut motility but did not result in severe disease. This study also examined whether routine use would reduce the risk or severity of Necrotising enterocotis in very pre term babies. It was concluded that regimented feedings could be effective in preventing these complications. However, there were no differences in terms of development of Neptune Colitis. Furthermore, it was observed that the frequency of sepsesis was lower in both groups. These results indicate that proliferating cultures may have some effect on the survival of prematurely weighed infant girls."
31348632,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, long-term follow-up study on uncemented hip prostheses in patients aged between 21 and 50 years. The outcome of the study is remarkable: at least 10 years after surgery, there is no significant difference in the wear of these new devices compared to conventional polyethylene or cementless stems. A new short, cemented, anatomically fixed hip implant is presented. This new device will be followed up for 15 years in four European centers. It will consist of two different types of hips: one with fabricated metal shell and one without. After five patients have been lost before followup, they are divided into two groups: 78 patients with ""a hybrid"" total hip replacement; 79 patients from 105 hip sockets with either femorotomies or cobalt/chromium heads. Both groups have similar bone mineral densities."
26838086,"This is a prospective, open-label, random-effaced study designed to examine the effects of transdermal and topical steroid treatments on women's health. The results show that patients experience significant reductions in their symptoms after one to three weeks of treatment with topicals or with progesterine. After six months, however, there is still no significant change in the severity of these symptoms."
27903955,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficaciousness of a walk-based intervention to supervised exercise in people with type 2 and peripheral artery diseases. The results suggest that walking is an effective treatment for patients who have moderately severe or lifelong claudicria."
30880409,"The effects of fiber on hunger and weight loss are studied in a weight control club. After two weeks, no change in hunger is observed in the controls. In this study, we examine the effect of different kinds of fibre on appetite control. For example, high-fiber breakfasts have an effect on short-time appetite changes while low-fibricated breakfast foods have no effect. We also investigate the role of fat or fiber in improving blood lipid levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes. This study uses psyllum as an adjudicator for the reduction of total cholesterol by eight % in subjects who consume it daily. It was found that there were no significant differences in LDLcholesterol values between the three groups. However, after four weeks of consumption, both group's diets improved their overall health. Furthermore, water-soluble fibers seem to improve body weight and blood pressure in type 2 patients."
31866721,"In this study, we systematically examine the efficacy of manual and rotary root canal cleaning methods compared to those used with conventional instruments. The results indicate that time efficiency is superior to time-consuming techniques such as hand file and Flex Master. Furthermore, there is no significant difference in the experimental groups on the cervical, middle andapical thirds."
28860416,"In this study, we report the results of a single-year, multi-centre, multinational, randomized, partial doubleblinded, controlled trial. We conclude that combination therapy is superior to either agent alone in terms of bone mineral dentition and bone turnover measures. The primary end point was percentage increase on spine bone mass at 52 weeks with combined treatment. This regimen also showed significant increases in hip bone strength over the course of the trial; however, it did not lead to any significant reduction in fracture risk. To further evaluate the effect of progesterin on bone loss, an extended open-ended observational trial was conducted. Women were assigned to one of three regimens: estrogen only, progestine plus morphine or placebo. After follow-up, women received no significant changes in their bone markers. However, they had greater gains from baseline than those assigned by other groups. Estrogen replacement therapy increased bone growth in all but the active group. Bone mineral density change was negatively correlated with bone marker changes at six months."
15231618,"In this study, Wuthering Heights et al. concludes that St. John's tincture is superior to conventional contraceptives in terms of ovarian activity, bleeding episodes, and pharmaccokinetics for the use of both drugs. He also reports that more subjects report breaking their cloak during cycle A than with any other regimen. The results suggest that there is a significant increase in the frequency of intracyclic bloody events when using St-John'S tribulinogeneous solution."
17209826,"The results of this study are compared with those obtained from the previous two studies. The pH values on the root walls of the teeth were measured using Lentullo spiral fillers, and the Dentin pH was calculated by measuring the wall surface and one mm away in the innerdental. This study is designed to compare the efficacy between Niti-rotary instrumentation and a stepback technique for bacterial reduction. Forty eight patients with periodontitises were assigned treatment types. At the first appointment, only three bacteria were culture positive; at the second visit, 33 percent of cases revealed bacteria. In addition, there were no significant differences between groups. Aim The aim of these studies was to determine whether or not the use of chlordamycin as an antimicrobial dressing would reduce the number of pathogens present in root Canals. Twenty-fifteen teeth with necrocotic pulps were included. No significant difference between the groups was discerned. After 7 days, the tooth was filled with sampling liquid. Following initial laboratory samples, they were soaked again and then obtruated with Gutta Percha and H-25 sealer."
19789953,"This paper focuses on the use of the question-naire, which has been improved over the years, to assess maternal anxiety and depressed symptoms in pregnancy and postpartum. The results suggest that there is an association between maternal anxiousness and childhood recurrent pain. In this study, mothers with high trait anxiety were more likely to have child-rearing difficulties than those with low anxiety. A further study was performed on women who had experienced significant psychological difficulties during their first child."
32108309,"In this study, AlirocUMab reduces the risk of heart attack in patients with high-risk hypercholestrolemia compared to statin therapy. Aiming to compare safety and effectiveness of evoocumabus as an add-on treatment to maximally toleranced Statin Therapy in highly cardiovascular risk patients who have inadequately controlled hypocholesterolalemia, we performed a prespecified analysis after the final patient completes 52 weeks. The mean change in lowdensity Lipoprotein cholesterol from baseline was -48 at week 24; treated-emergen adverse events were similar between groups. To determine whether alirocumbabe is safe and efficacious, We conducted re-experiments on Japanese patients for whom LDL-c levels are still elevated. After 78 weeks, hefH patients were assigned to receive either 1,100mg or 150mmol daily. At week 24, there was no significant difference in mean percent change from baseline in calculated Low Densities lipophospholipid cholesterol level. There were also no differences in rate of injectionsite reactions among the two groups: 1.9% in Hefh I and 1.4% in placebo. This trial was designed to assess long- term effects on reduced low densitivity Lioprocrisy. It was concluded that despite current sterility and arduous care, many patients had elevated low-delity lipodyphilophic cholesterol levels."
20470443,"In this paper, we describe the results of an irrational and poorly-adjusted total hiparthroplasty technique. The average incision is only 10cm, and the coronal alignment between the cup and stem is within three degrees of neutral. A control group of 60 patients was followed for 10 to 16 weeks. After these studies, no significant differences were found between quality scores from the journals from 2003 to 2004, except for one study that used a higher level of evidence than those from other sources. This study compares the performance of two different surgical approaches: 1) single-indicated mini-implant approach with 2) conventionally angled posterior approach. Both groups have improved pain and function after six months following the surgery."
27479272,"Estradiola reduces hot flushe frequency by a greater than expected amount in combination with progesteron. A double-blinded trial of two hormonal regimens was conducted to determine whether the efficaciousness of each regimen was superior to that of the placebo group. The results were as follows: ""94 percent of cycles werefree of flushing"" and ""64 % of trials were free of stammering not requiringprotection."" In addition, there was no significant reduction in blood pressure during the fifth and six cycle of combination therapy. Women's health Questionnaires were used to assess menoupause specific quality of life among middle-aged females. After one year, women in the treatment arms reported hot blushes, trouble sleeping or sweating on their symptom questionnaire; however, they did not report any changes in their symptoms afterward. Estrogen/transvaganal progestone gel reduced exercise time but improved vasomotion symptoms. Two different doses are used for treating acute menopatial symptoms in Japanese women who have climactic symptoms such as amenorrel bleeding. Both studies showed marked improvement in severity of hotflueses at week 3 and 12, respectively. This study also revealed that both estrone creams had similar effects on improving pain and fatigue. Another study examined the effect of transdermisal patches on patients suffering from moderate to severe cold feet. They proved to be equally effective in reducing fever and headache. Although some side effects were noted, these were not serious nor unexpected."
32187830,"In this study, we examine the effects of a diet rich in whole grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables on blood acid concentrations. The results suggest that increased levels of these acids may lead to weight loss in overweight patients. A gastric bypass is an effective treatment for morbidly obesity. However, it does not induce any significant changes in the gut fecesal secretion. This study also suggests that bariaric surgery may be beneficial because of its role in reducing the amount of stomach-damaging bile salts present."
28985287,"In this study, we examine the effects of weight loss on patients who underwent embolizing their other artery for upper gi bleeding. After six months, blood pressure and weight were significantly reduced in both groups. Both groups had significant reductions in fasting glumness and o bestatin levels. The results suggest that lifestyle changes and metformin may be more effective in treating Type 2 diabetes than conventional therapy."
12500920,"Four and one-half years after the trial, 86 percent of the patients have died. In stage III, patients treated by Ftorascafur had better survival than those who received placebo. A two-year followup is reported. The group of gastric patients with advanced disease were assigned into two groups: 1) I, which received surgical intervention; 2) Ii a group that received BCG or 5-FU in the same sequence as division one; and 3) II whose treatment was not surgery only but also consisted of Thiomepa 45m/day for three days followed by 28 days for six months. This study seems to suggest that long- term postoperative treatments may be advantageous to patients suffering from advanced Gastric cancer. After resection, all patients receive 5Furoracil on day 1, 8 th, 29 nd, and 36 h. There is no difference in patient survival rates between the control groups except for the fact that they are more likely to survive beyond three years. For example, there is an increased risk of death at the end of this period when surgeons use semustine instead of conventional chemotherapy. However, these results indicate that N. rubral cell wall ""skeleton"" as an immunomodulatory agent can be useful in treating patients without curative involvement."
26322509,"The results of this doubleblind study suggest that a higher level of vitamin D may reduce the risk of asthma in Mongolian children who are deficient in this mineral. In addition, it is found that lower levels of 25-hydroxydioxetin lead to reduced odds of hospitalization and emergency department visits over four years. This trial was designed to assess the association between low-quality evidence and high-risk of bias in observational studies. Although there were no significant differences in lung function among African American children with or without adequate levelsof 25 H.D., these results support the use of large doses of Vitamin D as an aid in treating asthma."
24704678,"The effect of exercise and advice on neck pain is a mixed-effect. At 6 weeks, the effect on function is almost double that of advice alone. In addition, there are no significant differences in pain intensity or tenderness at 12 months. Whiplash-related disorders are common but incur considerable expense to social and economy terms. This paper discusses the use of brief physiotherapies as an early intervention for back pain. A population-based campaign was used to alter patients' beliefs about backpain in Australia. Three years after the intervention, doctors and the community became more positive about the condition. Two studies were conducted in two states in Australasia. One study reported that educating patients directly by nurse was superior to giving them pamphlets after whiplash injuries. Another study examined whether stress management was more beneficial than self-care books for patients with neck discomfort. Neck pain had been leading causes of Morbidity and Health Care Utilization. Although this study did not have any serious adverse experiences, further research is needed to confirm this effect. Back pain has become increasingly common and multiple treatments have been advocateed in its treatment."
30168261,"In this paper, we present a prospective cohort of patients with whiplash-related injuries who have not yet recovered from the injury. We use logistic regression to predict whether or not they will recover after six months. The results are mixed, but there is moderate evidence for using postural exercises to reduce pain and time out of work in acute whiplashes. Two independent reviewsers select studies for inclusion; assess methodological quality; and extracted data. At baseline, crash-relational data and health details including the sf 36 were evaluated in Whilash patients. After 48 h later motor vehicle accident, the emergency room was examined. Only one patient in both groups developed signs and complaints of fever during the followup phase. A large prospect ively follows cohorts need to identify possible medically relevant musculoskeletal findings. This study compares the efficacy and cost effectiveness of stratified primary care with current best practice. It found no significant differences between the two groups except for the frequency of recovery at 6 mo when compared to normal care. There were sixteen2 patients available on follow up at 12 months: 91 percent of those had sustained chronic pain. Delaying return to workwas associated with minor limb fractures/depressive symptoms. For each rapidly review,the evidence has been organized in 'a way that an appropriate clinician candirect their attention to specific part of the cycle of care within the E.D., such as assessment, diagnostic tests, management, and follow-on considerations From e.d."
30322268,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial compared the effects of an eight-week exercise program for patients with acute myocardiac disease.

30634478,"The aim of this study is to determine whether guar- gum, a fiber that relieves pruritum and improves the absorption of certain bile chemicals, can be used as an aid in treating pregnancy-induced cholestainsis. Forty eight pregnant women were given guiar gum before delivery and 20 healthy subjects were used control subjects. Serum salinol proportion was related to Pruriitus but was not affected by  Guar GUM. This study investigates whether or not intestinal binding of ""biliary acids"" by using gloriously soluble fiber prevents increases in blood levels of both prodigious and non-pregnant patients. A comparison of two methods for measuring human cholesterol morphology was made: 1) uptake of D into plasma free lipoprotein; 2) pulsed FSR in pooled/d; and 3) ASR with grams/mmol/h. These results indicate that some markers of short-term measurements of fat synthesis are associated with these markers. In addition, pitavastain treatment suppresses LXR' lig and other markers relative to cholesterol. Thirteen patients with biopsy proven lipidemia were examined. They showed no significant change in their total cholesterol concentration after treatment except for p 0.05. To compare the degrees of response of Plasma Lipid Concentrations and Glycemic Control to Plant Sterol Consumption in Various Types of Type 2 Diabetes. There was no difference in the percent change from beginning to end of the Trial. When 18 Non-diatic subjects and 14 Dairy subjects participated in doubleblind rand and Omized crossover trial, they did not show any differences in absolute concentrations nor percentage change between the Beginning and End ofthe Trial respectively. After fifteen non diabetics and fourteen diabetic subjects, we divided them into four groups according to age and gender. Each group consisted of 15 subjects who had been treated with different diets. For example, when 12 controls were fed 1.8 gram per day of either plant stems or corn starch, there was little difference over 21 days. Both groups also showed reduced body weight, increased fatty liver effects, and diminished expansion of abdominal perigonomal tissues. Histologies regarding liver biopsy to diagnosis NAFLD were performed. Hetological evaluation of liver biomarker to diagnose NFFLD was performed"
15229625,"In this study, Wuthering Heights et al concludes that vardenalfil is superior to other anti-erectile agents in men with severe or persistent ED. He also reports that the efficaciousness of valdenafil at 10 and 20mg doses is similar to that of placebo in patients with mild to moderate oestiologies. The safety of treatment was determined according to patient withdrawal and adverse events. After 12 weeks, a significant improvement in erythrocyte function was noted for both dosages; however, there were still significant negative effects on the quality of the erector's response. A novel selective phosphatediesterase Type 5 inhibitor, sildendaf, was studied in this trial. It showed an improved penile stiffness but no apparent changes in blood pressure or heart rate."
25182102,"The results of a long-term prospective follow-up study indicate that the use of gastric bypass in patients with morbidly excessive weight is safe and effective. Although many patients are seriously ill, the operation is performed with an escort rate of at least 0.5 percent. In addition, there are no major complications after the surgery. After two years, all patients have improved their health and quality of life. A large number of studies have shown that laparooscopic gasbic b and eating can be very effective for treating morbally obese patients. However, these studies do not reveal any significant differences in mortality between the two groups."
22353603,"In this study, the authors evaluate the efficacy of an etching-prime bonding system in treating cervical lesions. The results are similar to those reported in other studies; however, there is a slight difference in the performance of the two adhesive systems when compared to one another. For example, at six months, they lose 96 percent of their restorations. At three years, all but one restorative is replaced by 'a crown' after the recall. This study also compares the clinical performance with that of conventional self-etchers and enamel-etched materials. It is concluded that both methods meet the accepted standards for dentin and enamel material used in medical practice. However, it is noted that most patients do not have sufficient resistance to these newer technology. A comparison between the different types of cements was made: 1) All Bond SE, 2) Gluma solid bond, 3) Fuji Cap II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, RMGIC, SUM, and GLUMA Solid Bond. Both were found to be acceptable up to two years."
11580867,"The results of a combined tonsilectomy and tonsillectomy for children with bilateral otomies are presented. Although the addition of an ostillitis attack does not increase the risk of surgery, it does improve the outcome. A hundred and fifty patients aged between two and nine years with bi-joint osseous disease were divided into three groups: Adenoidoplasty 47 cases; Adenotonsillicide 47 case; and neither procedure 53 cases. In this paper, we examine the effect of trial size on the prediction of effusiveness in men with severe oligoplemmia. We conclude that there is no need for single small trials to be performed because only large trials can be used to calculate the relative efficacy of different drugs. Meta-analysis was performed to assess whether or not randomised treatment would lead to incorrect estimates of the effusion rate."
22161405,"In this paper, the authors discuss the association between trial funding and results of trials. They conclude that trials funded with for-profit groups are more likely to suggest the experimental drug in treatment of choice than trials based on donations from other parties. Mirtzapine and Paroxeten are both effective in treating major depressive disorders when used for 12 weeks in primary care. Both drugs improve quality of life as well as severity of depression. A doubleblind, parallel- group design is performed to compare efficacy against sertraline at two different dosages in patients with Major Depressive disorder. The main outcome measures are the Hamilton Rating Score for depression and the ClinicalGlobal Impressions scale. Although no significant differences were observed between the two groups, there was no difference in the change over time in either group. This study suggests that mirtrazpinie may have earlier onset action for antidepressed symptoms."
26081915,"In rats, gastric bypass induces a satiating gut hormone response and reduced food intake. The patients in the conventional treatment group lose an average of 5.1 pounds over the course of the program. However, when combined with weight loss, the patients lose more than twice as much. Bariatic surgery does not lead to greater changes in blood lipids. Instead, it leads to reductions in both total and low-density-cholesterol levels. VSG surgery causes increased serum bbile acid concentrations that relate to weight lost after surgery. All mice on HFD were randomed to Sham operation or Sham-PF. After sacrifice, all mice were treated with GLP-1 7, 36-like anti-inflammatory peptide. This was found in human bowels but did not seem to be important in secretion by post-bariatricians. To further investigate the role of Glp-1 7-36 in suppressing lipogenesis, we compared the effects of two different types of diets: High-Assayti and Comb. Both treatments resulted in significant improvements in body mass, haemoglobin, and other measures. These results suggest that these three methods are effective for treating obesity."
21053026,"The results of this study suggest that patients with back pain who are not physically active should refrain from pursuing any physical activities and instead seek out ""non-specific physical exercises to reduce pain. This suggests that they should focus on non-specified physical activity to improve their health."
30287245,"In this paper, we examine the underlying nervous systems of visual and auditory perception in young children with an autistic disorder. We use a pre-difference task to assess whether or not individuals with the disorder respond to temporal sequences differently than those without. This suggests that some aspect of the brain is involved in learning to associate language and visual information."
28376055,"In this study, infants fed with a higher-dose of vitamin D were not bone mineralized at 3 months. The authors conclude that in order to prevent the risk of deficion from developing, they recommend daily doses of 800 or 1,100 IU of Vitamin D. However, there is still debate as to how much should be given. For example, some studies suggest that only one-hundred and sixty-one infant groups receive 1,000 u/d of daily; others group 1 has no significant difference in blood concentration. A double blinded randoment was performed on 132 healthy breastfed children from Montréal between 2007 and 2010. We clearly demonstrated: at the ageof 4 months, none of them on the group 2, had aculorum levels of 25-Hyphovin D less than 30mcg perL. Thus, in try to avoid vitaminD deficient and rickels, we recommend replenishing dose of 500 nmoll/day as an effective dose. Conclusions and Reevance There are conflicting opinions regarding the exact daily dosage of 300 ng. Only 200 p.m. does not have any significant differences among these groups. At three months' age, all 100 and 60-nine newborns were assigned to either group1 or group 2. There were 75 infant girls in group 1, and 64 were divided into two groups with different numbers of 139 babies. Conscious and relative range among healthy term, chest-fed infant women, only 1500 ul/ day did increase plasma 25 H.D concentration to greater than 97.5 pp. Infants who received more than 400 vilevitamin D increased their serum levels above 50 mol. Lipid level was within normal. This study compares increases in plasma-25-hydroxyvitamine D"" concentrations after 3 mo of Daily D2 versus D3, and examines sun exposure time and UVB exposure during the initial 6 weeks of live. No apparent seasonal variation was observed. Calcium levels could not be improved. Therefore, the objective of this trial was to investigate the effect upon the rate of first and second recurrent disease among patients in Kabul, Afghanistan. It was found that both regimens had no effects on diarrheal disease. Furthermore, it was concluded that each regimen had little effect on infection.

25793643,"The aim of this study is to implement and evaluation an integrated care program in stroke patients. Using the Interdisciplinary Stroke & Risk-Maternal Education model, it was possible to reduce the likelihood or repeat stroke or venous event by improving a wide range of risk factors. This intervention was especially effective in reducing the severity of symptoms for stroke survivors who had experienced their first transient ischemia attack. In addition, they were better able to self-efficate for accessing information, feeling informed, and satisfaction with medicine. These measures were then further tested at time 1 and 5 weeks after the initial assessment. A follow-up survey was performed on 180 strokes survivors1 year after their second ischaem attack; these results were reported in the following two years. An education package that utilised either strategies on knowledge, health and psychological outcomes of stroke patient and carers was used as compared to usual care. It was found that there was no significant difference between the percentage of control risk factor controls between groups: intervention 57% vs control 55. 9 % P = 0.05"
24346781,"The results of this study suggest that general anesthesia does not pose any risk to long term mental function in elderly patients awaiting knee arthreoplasty. Sixtiously assigned to receive both general and spinal Anesthesia, the results were similar. Both groups had improved their scores on various measures. In particular, they showed no significant differences in blood loss after surgery. Postoperative pain scores were significantly lower in the spinal Aestry group than in General Anaesthesia. There was also no difference in length of hospital stays or mortality rates between the two groups. However, there was a slight delay in recovery from epiduralane when combined with local anaestics."
27859327,"In this paper, we examine the effects of a cash transfer program on maternal and child health in three different countries: the United States, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the African country of Kenya. We find that the most successful cash transfers are those targeted at orphans and vulnerable children; however, there is no evidence that these programs have any negative effects on overall fertility."
21890437,"A two-year milk intervention study compared the effects of dairy consumption on bone mineral content in girls aged 10 to 18 years. The results showed that dairy products had a stronger effect on height growth than other nutrients, such as milk and cheese. In addition, young girls who were not provided with adequate food for their growth were more likely to have higher levels of body mass and total body Bone Mineral Content."
28034901,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effect of body mass-index on long-term risk of complications after abvg surgery. The results suggest that patients with higher body masses have fewer complications than those with lower bodymasts. Anderson concludes by stating that ""BMI is not associated withfive-year mortality"" in the ptca group and that there are other groups with different levels of weight such as low, normal, overweight, and class I/III obese. He then uses propensity score match to determine whether or not an excessively high body Mass-Index affects hard-to-read outcomes in patients who undergo cagb surgery"
32176779,"In this study, we examine the safety of amiomedarone and procainacinamide in patients with acute atrial fibrillation. Although there is no significant difference between the two forms of treatment, it is clear that they are safe and have no side effects. A prospective, double blinded, placebo-control study was conducted to evaluate the efficaciousness and safety for propafranone, acetidine, and vivotril in treating recent-onset paroxymsal atrium fibrillation; all were well toleratedas. The results showed that conversion to normal Sinus rhythm was achieved within 48 hours when compared with an eight-hour regimen of flecadinide. This trial was designed to determine whether or not pacemaker therapy would be more effective in terms of alleviation of symptoms and need for immediate hospital admission."
31885541,"In this study, 66 patients with a history of nonalcoholic disease were divided into three different groups: 1) Bifdophagium longum; 2) lifestyle modification; and 3) diet and exercise. The results showed significant differences between the two groups in terms of blood concentrations of Leptin, insulin, and Holm-Irregularity. After 12 weeks, the probiotic ""Symbiter"" group reduced liver fat, amino transferases activity, as well as the levels of TNF-A and IH-6 in patients without alcoholism. This study was designed to assess the safety and tolerance of infant formulas that contained probiotase or prebiotics for safety"
29460165,"In this study, the effects of long acting morphine on children with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder are investigated. The results suggest that lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate, or ""ATX,"" is more effective in improving symptoms than buspirone; however, both drugs have significant side effects. A double blinded, cross-examination study compares the efficaciousness of melantine to methylmethi date in treating children who have attention deficit hyperaction disorder. Both drugs produce significant improvements on the teacher and parent assessment scales. However, neither drug produces significant improvement on other measures of performance."
15803086,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the role of psychological and physical factors in patients' treatment of chronic back pain. He uses a mixed-effects model to examine the association between patient beliefs about their ability to cope with pain and changes in symptoms after intervention. The results suggest that patients who demonstrate centralization during initial assessment are better off than those who do not show such an idylated state. This paper also discusses the use of multiple measures of control beliefs as predictors among patients with low back painful conditions."
30364990,"In this paper, we examine the effect of proton pump-inhibitors, histoamine H2R antagonists, and other Types of Antacid Drugs on fracture risk. We examined the effects of proton pumps in combination with statins and beta blockers on falls risk from a pooled analysis of patients who had suffered any kind of fracture during the year 1900. The results suggest that there is no association between fall risk and current use or use of single protopis or H1RAs. This study suggests that these drugs may have an effect on the nervous system as they are used to treat dizziness. A cohort study was performed using patient records from the age of 40-89 years included in the health improvement network. It found that several risk factors for falling were only associated with one particular risk factor: History of stroke, Poor mental state, Postural hypotension, but no relation to dose or duration. After adjustment by potential confounding factors, there was not relationship between falls either of these two drugs. Furthermore, it was concluded that ""there was no connection between drops and useof PPIs."" Thus, physicians should be cautious about prescribing these anti-foolish drugs because their side effects could be significant."
28459099,"This paper focuses on the effects of a walking program that involves pedometers in combination with other measures of activity. It compares two different approaches to blood pressure: one that uses an intensity-based approach and another that is based on selfefficacy. In this paper, we examine the effect of walking at brisk walk pace on blood flow in postmenopauseal women. We conclude that walking has been shown to have beneficial effects on health status in older adults."
24696195,"A single-drug treatment phase is used to assess a possibility pharmacophysiological interaction and the tolerateability of this combined drug treatment. The results suggest that both paroxene and mirtzapine are efficacious, well tolerated, when used for 12 weeks in patients with Major depressive disorder. Both treatments are effective in improving depressed mood as measured by group mean Hamilton Rating Score for depression; percentages of responders and repeaters; and Clinical Global improvement responder. In addition, they show no significant difference in side effects between the two groups. ParoXetine has fewer sideeffects than imipramin, but more likely to lead dropout than parometine. Paroxine appears to produce earlier improvements in agitations and psychological anxiety symptoms comparing with fluoxetine's ESERS scores for kathisia. Two studies have been performed on major depression: one in England and another in Germany. These studies were designed to determine whether those with severe depression have better response to either regimen. This trial will be carried out in the fall of 2008."
26378571,"In this study, we examine the effects of a Mediterranean-style diet on endotheal function and other markers of cardiovascular disease. The results suggest that DHA may be beneficial in reducing atherotypes and improving blood flow. We also assess the effect of two different Meddiets on immune cell activity and soluble inflammation biomarkers associated with atheogenesis. This study was designed to compare the efficacy of three different types of diets: 1) an all-out Mediterranean diet; 2) low-fat or high-la contented diet for patients with Type 2 diabetes; and finally 3) phosphorus-rich olive oils as anti-inflammatory agents."
15513655,"A prospective, naive cohort of workers at the Boeing plant in Canada reports that patients who report neck pain are more likely to suffer from pain during the following week than those with evidence of spine degeneration. The most predictor of this group of patients is their belief in the efficacy of treatment and their ability to cope with back pain. In addition, these patients have higher levels of job satisfaction and less pain when compared to controls without evidence for spinal degeneratedness. This study determines whether physical and psychological load at work can influence sickness absence caused by low back injury. It was found that there was no difference in severity or duration of illness due to lower-back pain between men and women. However, it was reported that ""flexion androtation"" were risk factors for absenteeism because they were associated with greater fatigue. Thus, the full intervention group returns to regular work faster than the normal care group. Another study examines the effects of activity on sick leave among industrial blue collar workers suffering from subacute mechanical low Back Pain. Workers returned to work much earlier than did control groups. Neck pain is particularly common in Europe as well as in North America. Although many studies have examined the relationship between health status and disease, few have been published. For example, one study has suggested that early intervention with examination may be useful in predicting future illnesses. Two other studies suggest that physicians should treat patients with acute Low Back pain rather than treating them with bed rest or exercise. One study uses self-reported measures of individual, psychosocial, and workplace characteristics to identify individuals with an increased odds for developing chronic occupational disability."
17923590,"Cya is superior to pentosansulfate in all patient outcome measures at 6 months. The Ics score is a validated, reliable, and respondable measure of improvement in patients with painful interstitial or cystitis. A pilot study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of hypbaric oxygen therapy for interspersed intertwined bladder disease. In this trial, four patients gain significant symptomatical relief compared to two receiving placebo. After three months, no significant improvement occurs in pain scores. This study further confirms the efficacies of pentopsanpolicysulphate as an effective treatment for moderate to severe congenital tuberculiosis; however, there are still unreconcerned side effects."
24200104,"In this paper, we describe an eight-month bup and nx maintenance treatment program for patients who are infected with HIV. The primary endpoint of the study is to assess the effects of daily home visits on quality of life after one year of treatment. After two years, subjects in the experimental intervention group were less likely to report using 100 p.m. or taking pills at any time than those in control group. This was due to their greater frequency of self-reported drug use during the first eight months of follow-up. We conclude that buprenophine has some promising efficacy in treating heroin dependence. Urine screen results indicate that 75 % of all illicit drugs are negative; furthermore, there are no significant differences in physical and mental health over time. At three months, retention in treatment is not significantly reduced. A comparison of staff commitments to abtinence-orientation policies indicates that they may be useful in improving patient satisfaction."
26163249,"The efficacy of probiotic treatment for children with atopic disease is compared to that of placebo in terms of the severity of symptoms. In particular, Lactobacilus salivarius appears to be more effective in relieving symptoms of asthma than either group does. A double blind, omize-controlled study was conducted on schoolchildren suffering from allergicairway diseases such Aspersion and Arresis. Forty patients with an history of Jcps illness were given booze or without  Bb536 at 2X 100g/day for 14 weeks. No significant differences were observed between the two groups for any IgE or blood cell markers. However, there were no significant changes in concentrations of Th2 cytokine secretion. Probiotic treatments seem to have some beneficial effects on immune system function."
23162042,"Larisondase improves the morphine-induced resistance in patients with mild-too-moderate myotonotic disease. A two-month weight loss program is shown to improve body composition, strength, and performance in obese children. The results of this exercise regimen are reported in this paper. In addition, the study uses the Friskisandsvettis ""open doors"" walking program to assess the effect of encouragement on walk test performance for adults with moderately ill health."
30687553,"In this study, we examine the effect of a single-week course of treatment on patients with mild to moderate psychosis. We find that both groups show significant improvements in their performance on the Categorithic battery and in other measures of mental health. For example, at week 12, there is pronounced improvement in the CATie neurocognittion battery for olazapine; at weeks 52, however, there are no significant changes in functional outcome. This suggests that although modest gains in brain function may not be sufficient to prevent further disease, they do have an important role in improving social functioning in people with schizophrenia. A recent study has shown that ""compensatory"" cognitive training can improve psychological performance as well as generalized or delayed-onset declines in symptoms."
19526214,"In this study, we examine the effects on blood glucose control of a high-fiber low-carbidohydrate diet in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that eating more fiber may improve blood sugar control in type 2 patients. We also report that consumption of chick peasant bread has been shown to be superior to conventional refined rice in improving both blood and lipid levels. This paper is an attempt to compare the effect of two different types of food on body weight, blood glucosemia, and insulin response. Both groups have significant changes in their health over time. A comparison of the three different diets was made for eight patients who had Type 1 or Type 2-diabetes. They were divided into four groups: 1) High-Carbohidrate, 2) Low-Glycemic Index ; 3) Carbody / Fiber ) and 2) Insulin-Dependent. These subjects were assigned to either group after being given pre-weighed meals. After two weeks, they were then assigned again to one of these five groups. Their performance was better than the other group's. However, there was no change in fat mass or lean body size. Thus, it was concluded that only 4 weeks of ""low-glycaic index"" diet could improve all aspects of Type 2, diabetic control."
28756133,"The aim of the study is to determine whether a patient-centered, action-oriented approach to care improves blood pressure and quality of living in patients with severe Type 2 diabetes. A pilot study was conducted in Brazil wherein eighty patients were assigned to either group of nurses or usual care. Both groups showed improvement in their health at six and 12 months. In addition, both groups improved their self-management behaviors by increasing their frequency of phone calls. Nurses' education was more effective than nurse-based intervention in improving control of type 2 patients. This paper reports that telemedicine has been shown to be more cost effective for patients who have poorly controlled Type 1 disease. However, it does not lead to significant changes in other endpoints such as major cardiovascular events, death, or microvascule complications."
31093862,"After weight loss, anthropometric changes are normal-women's. For example, they lose body fat, waist- to-hip ratio, TNF levels, and carbohydrate consumption. They also lose leptominemia in the presence of other adipogeninemias such as IL-3 and TxB2, but not with any medical treatment. In this study, we examine the relationship between inflammation, platelet activity, metabolic dysfunction, or PTX3, which is an important player within these switches. The results suggest that phosphorus transmembrance may be involved in obesity-related disease. A prospective cohort study was conducted on 74,952 women aged 40 to 70 who had been morbidly overweight for at least one year after surgery. It showed significant reduction in body mass Index during the first six months of the surgical intervention. This resulted in improvements in blood cell count, white blood cells, C-React Protein, haemolin, total cholesterol, fractions, etc. At follow-up, there were no significant changes in markers of inflammation. These included increased visceral abdomination tissue, risk factors for developing insulin resistance/ cardiovascular disease, low-grade systemic inflammation caused by obesity, reduced fasting glucose, elevated renin function, high-sensitive Creactive Protein concentrations among others. Finally, bariadic surgery improved all of these measures. There were only slight differences in BMI, Hb, GLP1, and PPM over time; however, both groups experienced improvement in their overall health status. Bariatic surgery seemed to improve many of those indicators. However, it did not lead to better sleep sensitivity."
29257898,"In this first study, we examine the effects on children's behavior of two different treatments: parent-centered treatment and a multi-component approach to treating ADHD. The results show that both groups improve on negative parenting or home improvement but only Clas families do. This study also shows that parents are more likely to take medication than waitlist control groups in order to reduce the risk of poor outcomes. A second study is designed to determine whether child-parent training can be used as an effective treatment for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. It has been reported that some studies have found no benefit from either type of treatment; however, there are still concerns about the efficability of these types of approaches. For example, one study suggests that ""cogmed working memory training"" may be more effective than standard therapy for children with hyperactive disorder because it involves reinforcement rather than reinforcement."
20149117,"Another study suggests that taking a glyceine-containing drink before bed may lead to sleep changes. In this case, however, the effect of blood sugar levels on sleep is not entirely clear. The effects of high and low blood glucose levels are thought to be related to feelings of less tension in young adults."
31485910,"FPC is a new type of iron therapy for hemilysis patients. In two studies, the dose of 1 g per day was shown to be sufficient to maintain blood concentration in the dialysis patient's system. The other study showed no significant adverse events after this treatment. Iron-replete patients with elevated ferritin were more likely to respond to IV iron than those with low levels of ferroprotein. A recent study found no association between IV or higher doses of Iv iron and risk of infection. This study furthermore examined the safety of using IV as an alternative to the use of oral iron."
20693238,"In this study, we examine the effect of physician reinforcement on patient adherence to treatment of postmenopause. We find that patients in both groups respond well to the regimen and are able to tolerate longer periods of treatment with greater efficacy than those in other groups."
26899439,"The purpose of this paper is to assess the quality of foot care practices in a small rural population of older adultds and identify factors that are associated with foot-self-care. A total of 701 elderly adults from two North Carolina counties were invited to participate in an education program for their feet. These patients reported improved satisfaction, and mean improvement was nearly 33 percent. This study examined the influence of simple education on the risk of lower-exertion limb ulcers in patients with Type 2 diabetes. In addition, there was no significant difference in medical management nor clinical risk factors among the two groups. Two hundred thirty patients were re-employed into three groups: group 1, education, group 2, and overall success in group 1 was significantly different from group 2; there were no differences in Medical management or clinical risks between these two sets. At follow up,there was remarkably similar foot self-carrying behaviors between groups at both levels. Both groups showed improvements in foot knowledge and selfefficacy. After six weeks, the control group also showed greater reduction in number of patient problems required for treatment than either group. Finally, it was concluded that ""incorporation such intervention into routine health services may enhancethe qualityof care and decrease"" the incidence of low-extremity wounds."
24737108,"In this study, the effects of aspirin, statin and polypill on patients with a high risk of heart attack are investigated. The results suggest that initial therapy with the T80 or H25 is associated with greater reductions in mean blood pressure and lipoproteincholesterol levels after two weeks at higher dosages. This trial was approved by the Australian Newzeal andClinical Trial registry. A nine-member consort has been formed to investigate whether an aspidin-containing pill will improve blood flow and reduce the burden of acute cardiovascular disease. After follow-up, both the Polypil and St and Ard practice resulted inmarked reduction's for blood force and LDL content. Both groups showed significant reduction but no differences were statistically significant. FOCus Phase 2 is r and Omized trial designed to compare adherence among 1,340 postmyocardials either receiving an antihypertensionic treatment or receiving the similar 3 drugs separately. It found that the polypan pill reduced blood forces and total cholesterol significantly than expected. However, it did not lead to any major adverse events. Valsartans Antihypersive Long-Term Use Evaluation was designed specifically to test the efficaciousness of amlofdipine andatorvastatis in patients without elevated blood tension or lipid level. Although there were some minor side effects, these were all mild to moderate."
26487439,"In this study, patients were exposed to the source of fear during their anxiety while their blood pressure and heart rate were recorded. They were able to improve their levels of anxiety at every time point compared to their baseline level. At Week 1, propranolal and chlordindia Zepoxide showed significant improvement over placebo in treating anxiety. After solitary blinded placebo washout period, they were divided into either groups with either 80 or 160mg/day respectively. The effect was seen on intellectual function as well as physical health. A double-blinded crossover study was carried out on 35 medical college students to assess whether acute beta-Adrenotic blockade treatment with proproloL improved intellectual functions. It was observed that subjects had considerable anxiety before laboratory speech and music performances. Brain Snack: Buspirone is not effective for treating panic attacks; however, it has been shown to be more effective than other antidepressants like fluoxetine. This study also included a prospective double blind trial wherein 29 patients received an appropriate dose of alprasolam followed by 15 patients receiving 182.0+ / 60.5m mean daily dosage of proprel lol. These patients did not experience any improvement in their symptoms after six months. Preparations for surgery were conducted by non-professional volunteers. Prior to surgery, no improvement was noticed on any measures except for pain scores and patient satisfaction. Before surgical intervention, all patients had successfully been given 'a test doseof propreal Lol' without side effects. All patients under age 30 were healthy men who had undergone two hours training workshop. No improvement could be noted on these measures but were mildly affected. There was neither concomitance nor behavioral treatment. Thirty eight patients agreed to participation in another study evaluating imipramine against propramolel in the control of panic disorder. Both somal and psychological symptoms improved as judges by patient and watchr ratings. Patient and observer rating scales include Sheehan Panic And Anxietyattack Scales -- the MarksSheeh Phobia Score --the Hamilton Antianxiness Score, the Hamilton depression scale, and theside effects checklist."
14678922,"Acute fibrillation, a common disease in the elderly, is frequently treated with aspirin. However, it is not known whether this treatment will prevent or delay relapse of atrial fibrillation. The use of low-dose digoxin for conversion to normal sinus pattern has been shown to be more successful than transthorac cardioversion. In patients with intermittent atrium fibilation who have no other risk factors, doflelide seems to convert their arrhythmic condition quickly and safely. This study compares the efficaciousness of sothalol and verapamem when used to treat chronic atary fibilation; however, the safety of these two drugs is still unknown."
16717289,"In patients with advanced or metastatic disease, the same combination of morphine acetal and dexamine is shown to be superior to placebo in preventing nausea and vomiting. A double blinded study comparing the efficaciousness of three dosers of intravenously ondansentron in the preventive effects of high-dose Cispicillin-induced delayed Emesis over two consecutive courses of treatment was performed. The results suggest that a proper dosage regimen should be used for managing chemotherapy-induced nausea/vooding. Metoclopricamide has been shown as an effective antiemetic in children; however, it does not have any significant side effects. Two large studies are conducted regarding the safety and efficiacy of meto Clopramide when used alone or together with deXamethaone. These studies confirm previous reports about the use of both drugs in treating nausea after cyplatin therapy."
31232513,"In this study, the effects of gastric bypass on morphine absorption are investigated. The results suggest that posacanazole is more effective than fenobrate in terms of weight loss after Roux En-Y Gastric Bypass. A previous study showed an increase in systemic exposure to atorvastasin acid 3 - 8 weeks after surgery for obese patients. This study also suggests that it is possible to predict the effect of different time and surgical procedure on absorbing drug. For example, there was no significant difference in area under the concentration-time curvature between the two groups of drugs when compared to controls. Furthermore, ranitidine has been shown to be particularly effective at reducing the risk of relapse following bariatic surgery. However, these studies do not reveal any changes in the efficacy or safety of either treatment."
24622671,"In this paper, we report on the association between low-dose supplemental vitamin D and reduced risk of tuberculous disease in women with type 2 diabetes. We conclude that high levels of 25-hydroxyvindol are associated with improved survival in patients with Type 2 who have been treated with conventional treatment. Furthermore, our results suggest that increased levels may be beneficial for people suffering from chronic diseases such as heart disease and colon disease. This paper also discusses the use of case-control studies to assess the effects of different forms of therapy on patients' health. Although there is some controversy over the roles of rand and Omized trials in medical science, the evidence remains persuasive. The rationale behind such trials remain persuasive as well as recent suggestions for alternate methods for improving clinical trial performance. However, these developments are not easily adapted to large- scale, complex medical experiments in which there might be multiple endpoints and delayed response time. Finally, it is concluded that elevated levelsof C-reactin and/or alpha-lipoic phospholipathione level are significantly related to psychological distress and depressed mood among older women. Women with higher blood concentrations of both soluble and insoluble cholera polynelic acids are at greater risk for developing physical disability than those with less levels."
27039305,"A cross-cultural comparison of the Norwegian shoulder pain scale and the Shoulder & Disability Index with those of two widely used shoulder questions, the SpADI and Ostebria Questionnaire, is made. The results suggest that both measure pain and disability but are not as accurate as the other measures. In this study, we examine the response of patients to the Scottish shoulder assessment instrument, which has been used for over a hundred studies. We conclude that it is useful for both medical and scientific purposes."
26710217,"This study focuses on the relationship between physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and intentions toward the use of the Dutch pain management guideline for patients with nonspecific back pain. The results suggest that physicians are more likely to follow the recommended treatment plan than those who do not. A cross-sectional survey of psychiatric patients is used to assess the acceptability of acute lowback pain in primary care settings. In this paper, we examine the extent to which physicians adhere to the American College of Physicians' ""Guiltful Use of History"" and other evidence-based practice approaches for treating patients suffering from chronic low Back Pain."
24743931,"In this study, we examine the effects of an eight-week circuit training program on body composition and blood pressure in overweight children. The results suggest that exercise training may be a good strategy for preventing weight gain in these young men. We conclude that it is feasible and can lead to improved weight and health outcomes among overweight boys."
18671894,"In this study, we examine the effects of multiple-micronutrient supplements on infants in a poor-to-dozen-month-old population in India. The results suggest that iron and zinc may be more effective than either alone. Children with anemia are more likely to benefit from weekly or daily supplementation because they have higher concentrations of these vital nutrients. A double blinded placebo-controlled intervention is used to determine whether two different types of micronutrientes can improve growth and health in children in low- income countries. One group receives only one type of multivitamin/multimineral; the other groups receive three kinds of single-micronutritants. All four groups show significant improvements in blood counts, height, weight, and length after six months of treatment. Both groups also show improvement in motor development. Two hundred fifty-nine girls were assigned to either fortified or unfortification rusks, daily for three mo. They showed no decline in their hemoglobin content during the study. Anemia was the most prevalent nutrition deficience in the world. This study investigates the effect of combined iron, zinc, iron plus zinc, or mixed forms of vitamins and minerals on improving iron status in Indian babies. Infants who received the ""fortenified spread"" or ""unfortable spread plus metirondazole"" did not show any changes in body functions. However, it was found that the formulation needed some adjustment in order to prevent iron deficiencies from developing. Iron deficient infant formula does not affect the individual effects by iron or zinc. For example, there was no difference in serum ferritsin concentration between the control group and the fortined spread group. Babies receiving the porridge had improved their physical condition but neither increased their iron nor zinc levels. These studies indicate that local food production will help reduce the burden of malnourished children's disease."
26620873,"In this study, we examine the effects of a single dose of dexteroamphetine on motor activity in hyperactive boys. We conclude that it is possible to use an extended-spectrum drug called ""AtX"" to treat hyperactivity and other symptoms in children with suspected or unspecified ADHD. The results suggest that treatment with this drug can lead to improvements in both behavior and motor function."
28650969,"The aim of the present study is to compare the efficacy of continuous ultrasound and sham therapy for knee osteoarthritis. In this paper, results from a double-blind, entomatic trial are compared. A significant reduction in pain scores was found in all groups except for group I, which improved significantly by comparison to control group. This suggests that treatment with mechanical devices may not be as effective as other treatments."
32248344,"A novel approach to total hip surgery, the mini-invasive approach, is described. It uses a shorter and less muscledissection than the conventional approach in order to reduce soft tissue damage. In this study, we examine the results of patients who undergo both anterolimbic and posterior approaches for total knee arthrostry. We conclude that the minimally-incisioned approach is superior to the classic approach because it allows greater soft injury while reducing blood loss. This paper also discusses the safety of the direct anterior or posterior surgical approach when compared with those performed by the traditional approach. The main aim of our study is to determine whether there is any difference in the length of post-operative stay between the two approaches."
27749375,"This study focuses on the effects of live music therapy on patients' mood, compliance, and relaxation. The results indicate that music can be effective in improving pain and anxiety during nursing procedures. Eight subjects with a history of cancer were assigned to either experimental or wait-list controls group. Parents in both groups reported spending more time visiting their infants in the neonates than did parents who received control infant care. In addition, children in each condition showed less distress and pain than those in other two conditions. Music has also been used as an aid to improve quality of life for many medical conditions; however, studies have found no significant differences among treatment groups. Acutely ill patients are often treated with only one type of intervention: music. However, this is not considered sufficient to predict long-term changes in health."
14974003,"""Quality of life benefits of 'Pectoris-of-care' are diminished by continuing smoking"". In this study, we examine the effect of continued smoking on health quality and performance in patients who undergo a post-heart attack procedure. After two years, there is no difference in outcome between those who stop smoking and those that continue to smoke. The British Heart Study has been used to separate men into three different groups: 1) no evidence of Ischaemic Heart Disease; 2) no Evidence of Myocardial Infa Rct Ion; and 3) No Sign of Pre-existing Heart disease. These studies have not been very well performed. A prospective follow-up trial was carried out among 1,100 men who had recovered from an myomyodal infpa rck ion. This study suggests that smoking may be as important as other risk factors for heart attack after an acutely occurring myory infusion. Men with Type A score were more likely to develop recurrent heart disease than those without. They also had fewer frequent visits to the emergency room because they did not smoke much."
14763716,"The results of this study suggest that the use of a shoe-insole to treat foot pain is more effective in patients with Hallux Valgus than in those without. After one year, the number of ulcers relapsed in the control group is lower than that of the other two groups. A foot function-index score is calculated and used to predict the extent of improvement in people with foot problems."
28379619,"In this study, the authors report that there is no evidence of a benefit in early treatment of acute coronary disease with renins or other antihypertension agents. They conclude that aliskiran, ramisan, or amlofdipine are more effective at reducing blood pressure than either type of therapy. A nine-point classification system was developed to categorize missing outcome data and determine whether it was reported bias. The seven studies included in this analysis were: hypertension; urology; epilepsy; complimentary medicine; and two not limited to 'a clinical topic'. These 7 studies did not differ from for the other Biomedical and Lifestyle outcomes and druguse use. Perseus trials consist of two parallel studies on the TTxus Element strut in single heartitus lesions. This trial uses an advanced statistical approach to examine whether design and material iterations provide comparable safety as compared to previous generation Express Stent. Aliskire, another new class of nonpeptide drugs, has been studied to inhibit the formation of angiotesin I and III in healthy volunteers. It reduces blood flow by up to 70 mg per day. There are no significant changes in mean sit diasolic bloodpressure after treatment with 1,75 mmHhg versus 1,150 vs placebo. After 8 week, all patients reduced their mean sitting diatstolicblood pressure by 13%. At least half of these patients had severe adverse events including stroke, heart failure, hospitalization, and aborted death."
23480090,"In this paper, we describe the results of a study on airborne and wound counts in the operating theater. The mean and median count is 0.5 Cfu per m3, with BES; however, there was no relationship between the air-count and the wound count. Both types of clothing are less effective than conventional theatre clothes. Sixtiful patients underwent total knee replacement using Charnley Mulller prosthesis had significantly lower infection rates when they were treated with prophylactic cottons. A comparison of the effect of whole body washing with chlorhixidine on the incidenceof postoperative wound infections was performed in brisk fashion. It was found that preoperative wholebody washing by chlorhexid reduced the rate of infection at the time of surgery. There were no limitation in terms of Biocompatibility for the Iodine impregnated drape Consequently antiseptic effects also occurred under the incest drape when it was applied to the Skin. At the same time, bacterial Wound contamination was reduced. Chlorhaxidine concentrations ranged from 10,1.4 to 148.4 pm inthe 4 % chlorHexide group compared with 2,031.3ppmin 2 %) CHG cloth. Conclusions Effective Chg levels were achieved upon most skin site after using 4"
24690623,"In this study, we examine the association between blood concentrations of 25,hydroxyvitaminD, or 25-OH-D, and risk for breast cancer in patients with severe disease. The results suggest that lower levels of 25H-d may be associated better with overall survival than those with higher levels. We also find that there is no relation between serum 25h-choliciency and breast tumor recurrance; however, when stratified by age, gender, premenopause status, parathormone hormone, pH, Charlsons comorbitance index, etc. Serum 25th-hydroxyvin D levels are significantly lower among women with advanced postmanopausalsal breastcancer. When compared to men with 25 H-Ca2-Nmol/L, adjusted odds Ratios were 1.14 for those who have concentration 10 and 20 ngg/ml, 1.00 for individuals with concentration>20 and  30, nmol O1L. A significant inverse relationship was observed between dietary V-VDA and total intakeof vitamin D and new breast malignancies within the Women'sHealthEating and Living Study. This study does not relate to any breast diseases but only to general mortality. It finds that older people with high-25H diacytic status are at greater risk of all cause and cardiovascular mortality than their younger counterparts. They do not show increased risk from acute viral infection. These studies provide further evidence that low 25F-OXD levels can predict major health outcomes. For example, they indicate that certain genetic differences inthe vitamin C receptor lead to reduced susceptibility to heart attack. Furthermore, these studies confirm previous reports that elevated 25 F-OMG levels reduce the risks of fractures and falls in elderly persons."
25616710,"The aim of this study is to develop an original classification of renal tumors suitable for non-separable nephrotomies. In addition, the authors present a large American cohort of patients with early stage renal cell carcinoma and use these results to predict the risks of complications from the surgery. A new prediction model was developed using Cox's regression to estimate the risk of Rcc-specific mortality at 5 years after resection. This work has been validated in other studies as well as by meta-analysis."
29883970,"The effect of parathyroid Hormonise on metabolic control was not observed in either group. In contrast, the changes in circulating blood pressure, fastingblood glucose, Hba1c, Creinine, Phosrous, Alkaline phosphorus, and lipid concentrations were found to be similar in both groups. A double blind, randomized, placebo-control trial was conducted with 60 patients with Type 2 Diabetes who received paraticicitol for 12 weeks. No significant change was seen in their endotriumal function or markers of inflammation or oxidative stresses. Metamorphisms at the endof the 12 week supplementation trial were no significant difference; however, they did improve glyceric markers, including but not without improvement in bone turnover markers. This study was designed to assess the role of Vitamin D and omega 3 fatty acids on cardiovascular risk among type 2 diabetes subjects. After six weeks, participants were divided into two groups: one group received 1,000 mg of eicosolateic acid and another group receiving 200 IU of vitamin D every day. These results were followed by a further investigation into the effects of high-dose VITAMIN D on serum liposomes and other inflammatory markers as well as heart/body weight proportion. Both groups showed marked reductions in total cholesterol, LDLcholesterol, Glycemic Score, Insulin resistance, C-Reactive Protein, Plasma Fibrinogen Levels, White Blood cell count, Age, season of birth collection, waist circumferential, total nonpension house wealth, measures of healthy and health behavior that included depression"
25834421,"The six-min walk test, a commonly used exercise test for patients with plebeians, is more sensitive than the 6-minute walktest for determining the amount of oxygen needed in patients who have severe obstrumental disease. In this study, we examine the effect of walking distance on heart rate and lung function as well as on quality of life after pulmonary intervention. We conclude that walking tests are superior to other measures of physical performance because they can be directly correlated with each other. A comparison of three different exercises was made: 6 minute walk, progressive cycleergometry, and endurance time. These results were validated by multiple independent cross-over studies. For example, one study showed that there was remarkably similar changes in the six minutes walk when two trials were performed before and after rehabilitation. Another study examined the effects of an interval training program on peak exercise ability and health-regarding qualityof life in subjects with moderate or very severe chronic obstructed pulmonary disease; however, no significant difference was found between the intervals."
24289848,"The results of this study suggest that pyrostigmine may be an effective treatment for patients with chronic pain. A long-term exercise program is used to treat women with a myalgical condition, some of which also have chronic exhaustion and immune dysfunction Syndrome. This paper describes 'an ongoing long term clinical exercise regimen for womenwith fibromyalsgia"" who are also suffering from fatigue and other symptoms. In addition, the patient receives daily diary entries in order to track their progress. These studies provide further evidence that lac might be useful in treating these patients. Women with FMS report improved sleep quality and improvement in pain scores. They also report improvements in tender point count, fatigue, and mood. Pregaballin improves pain but does not improve quality of life. Another study investigates the efficaciousness of ""low energy"" lasers in the treatmentof musculoliskeletal conditions. It was found that there were no side effects; however, it was reported that they reduced pain and fatigue significantly. Other studies investigated the use of electrocranial magnetic stimulation as an aid to relieve pain caused by feigning rhyming disease. There was considerable improvement among the patients in both groups. Both groups showed signs of improvement on pain score, tender points count or fatigue. However, neither group showed any significant change in depression or anxiety. Finally, we examined the effectiveness of pool exercises combined with physical education for improving health status, functional consequences, mental health, etc."
26065374,"In this paper, we describe the results of an early intervention program for young children who have a severe or multiple-onset disease. We compare two social communication approaches to one that uses picture exchanges to teach imitation skills. Children with and without autistic symptoms show significant improvement in imitation ability on the Preschool Imitation and Praxis scale. The PIPS score is 7.2 indicating that it can be used as an outcome assessment to determine children's maturity or improvement. This study also examines the effects of reciprocal social engagement and joint attention on children with autism. Both treatment groups improve their performance on language and behavior measures. However, there are no significant differences between group characteristics at age 1 and 2; however, both groups do not differ on severity of ASD. Parents receive Early Start Denver parent training which has been shown to be highly effective in improving child well-being. There is no difference in intelligence, language, and daily living skills but neither does there any change in Autism symptoms over time. These studies suggest that delayed ""first words"" are among the most commonly presenting signs of audismatic spectrum disorder."
31029060,"Arthritatic disease is more common in children than in adults. In this study, we examine the association between pain and severity in patients with juvenile idia. We use a combination of pain-trajectory modeling and patient-response measures to predict whether or not JIA will lead to poor pain outcomes later in disease. A second approach is used to assess changes in the blood pressure and insulin signaling system in subjects with high resistance. The results suggest that treatment with an anti-tumorous agent such as influsimab improves both pain control and improved blood flow in those with higher resistance levels. This suggests that therapy may be useful for improving health in people with JJA."
28027038,"Myofasical therapy using icing the length of your bicepals, at the Bicipital Aponeurosis, and atthe pronator Teres could be useful approach to relieve symptoms associated with carpal tunnel Syndrome. In this practice-based trial, we found no significant differences in change in motion between groups. The improvement was noted only for the disability questionnaire; however, patients in both groups showed greater improvement in the function of the wrist. After a 6 week period of post-treatment, the patients performed an independent home exercises program showed 'a significantly greater improve of"" the functionality of their wrist after surgery."
32359762,"The effects of a daily L-clortine regimen on body weight, blood pressure, and lipids in patients with polycodystic ovaries. In addition, the results of carnitine's anti-oxidative stress effect are described. Carnitine reduces total lipoprotein concentrations by reducing malondial dehyde levels; however, there is no significant change in other measures of health. This study compares the efficaciousness of two different forms of treatment for Type 2 diabetes: simvastain monotherapy or L Carnitine. It is shown that both groups show significant improvements in body mass, fat mass/body mass index, insulin resistance, heart function, etc. Furthermore, it has been reported that only one group shows any significant changes in these parameters."
28698929,"The results of this study are presented in the form of a cross-sectional comparison between two groups of patients. Forty- five patients underwent total knee archroplasty and were prospectively randomed into three groups: conventional instrumentation, PSI, and signature-tm device group. In each group, there was an improvement in accuracy of component positioning with respect to tibiary slope and internal malrotations. A patient-specific guide improved the precision of aligning for both femor and taliar components; however, these improvements were not significant enough to justify the cost of the new technology."
26644891,"In this study, 571 children are assigned to treatment. The probiotics used in the trial are Lactobacilus rhumnosus strain G, Saccharomiecia boulardisii, Bacillus causia, mix of Ldelbrueckyi var Bularicus, Streptostococcous thermophilus and L acidophilic. Children receive either isoronic or hypotonic Oral Rehydration solution with Osmolality 3, 11 Molmol/L and S.90mmol-L; after two ORS were performed equally for Acute rehidratation, and oral R.H. dosage was associated with shorter duration of Diarrhaea than Intrvenous reahulation. This study compares the effect of different proicrobial preparations on the treatment of disease in children between 2 and 3 years of age. Probiotic products have been found more frequently in recent years. However, there are few available commercially available ones. There are also some studies that suggest that proliferating an appropriate amount of these strains can reduce the risk of contracting rotavir infection in young children. These studies show that infants receiving suitable but not inactivated strain LGG significantly reduce their suspense over time. Furthermore, they indicate that viable strain GG induces immune responses in susceptible patients. Further studies are needed to determine the role of prosicins in adults. Young male military recruiters received a yogurt bearing LacTobacillum casei strain at 105 colony-forming units per day orally for three days. They reduced the risks of nosocovial gastrointestinal tract infections by as much as 12 percent when compared with those treated with placebo. Infants who had no antibiotic before being admitted were given additional doses of LacTOBACILLUS caseI strain. Pediatric patients were divided into two groups: one group received IVLG at 6x 10 x 9 colonies-forming unit or another group took pity on them. Both groups showed significant improvement in terms of length of diarrhea. After several trials, it has been shown that Lactopicillin gg improves recovery from severe acute diarrium. Other studies confirm this finding. For example, we studied the effects of VSL-3 on dehydrating child diarea. It was found that both regimens improved the frequency of stool frequency and volume of dryness"
27226400,"Preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation significantly improves the quality of life of patients with lung disease before a resection. In this study, we examine the effect of short- term preoperative exercise training on exercise capacity in patients who have been undergoing thoracoloscopic roostomy. The results indicate that there is little difference in the severity of symptoms after surgery compared to those after conventional treatment. A prospective observational study assesses whether long-term pulmonary rehabilitation can reduce the risk of complications from thromopic lobectomy. This study also focuses on changes in blood levels of fibrinogen as well as other markers of inflammation in malignant lung diseases."
29288248,"A cross-over between a dairy product rich in conjugated alpha-Linolic acid, or ""CLA,"" and an American diet was studied to determine the effects of this new type of food on atheroscoutic biomarkers. The results showed that consumption of the cheese naturally rich with CLA improved several markers of inflammation, including interleukin-6, interferon-8, and tumour Necroisis Fact-alpha. This study also examined the effect of different types of dietary fats on various inflammatory markers. In particular, it found that increasing the amount consumed from fatty acids such as alph-linOleic Acid increased the proportionately greater amounts of Dha in plasma lipophospholipids. Furthermore, studies have suggested that adding these oils to the diet can improve blood lipid profiles. These studies suggest that using n-3LC-Pufa enriched  Yohurt resulted in reduced cardiovascular risk factor and irritant mediators; however, no significant changes were observed in body weight or body fat mass after 12 weeks of intervention. Conjugatd lioleici acid is primarily used for weight loss but has been shown to have some anti-inflammatory effects."
22340263,"This is a prospective observational study in which 2438 patients are enrolled. The mean duration of QRS is reduced to 105 ms. / 27 at discharge, and the mean age of the patient was 70 years. In terms of quality of life, the six-min walk distance improved by 20 p.m.; the peak valet by 11 pp.i.e. improves the performance of all other measures. At 12 months, all 63 percent of AF were programd to biventricular resynchronation therapy. All SR and 80 % of AFF were programmed with BiV  Pacing. Both groups showed significant improvements in left ventricular functions and functional capacity. However, little has been known about the effect of CRT on heart failure patients who have permanent atrium fibrillation. Conclusions: Atrioventricular Junction ablation and pacering in patients with persistent atrial fillation may confer acute or long-term advantages beyond rate controlby eliminating rhythm irregularities. Ablation increases cardiac output for 4.7 vs 5. 0.8 l/min; P value 0.051 for all values. Improvements in exercise tolerance in both groups were noted."
29556750,"Evidence-based medicine is used to improve the quality of care delivered to patients with chronic disease. In this study, we examine the effects of an interdisciplinary approach to physical activity on knowledge and social support in people with recurrent rheumaloid arthritis. We find no differences between these two groups regarding health behavior or exercise ability. However, there are no significant differences in patient satisfaction at 24 months after the intervention. The results suggest that evidence-base medicine can be used as a model for improving medical care. A recent study suggests that an ""Implified Arthritas Self-management program"" may be more effective than other forms of exercise for relieving pain and improving symptoms in patients suffering from RA."
17054258,"This paper describes the results of a two-year study on laparoscystomies for acute gallstone disease. The outcome was better than that of open surgery, with improved conversion to open treatment. In contrast, the risk of injury is higher in patients who undergo contrast-enharmed MR chollangiography. A comparison of the performance of both groups was made. Both groups had significant complications and were more likely to require further intervention. However, there was no difference in conversion or complications between the early and delayed group. Post-erceptic panceratitis occurs in 3.8 percent of patients after initial conservative treatment; post-elective operation occurred in 33% of these patients. Sumidary background information: Laparoscopic ""cholecychstectomy"" for an acute choeciasis is associated with High complicationand conversion rates. Pooling exercise does not replace well designed &#8216 clinical trials' designs. Methods For combining data From several studies exist, but it should be cautiously done. Conclusions We found "
28795075,"This study focuses on the frequency and severity of injuries among females. It is shown that women experience more than two-thirds of all anterior cruciatous ligament injuries in comparison to men. The aim of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship between premenstrual dysfunction and ACL injury in women. In this paper, we examine the association between the period of menstruation and the rate of ankle sprained ankles in college basketball and soccer. We conclude that relaxationin is present in both men and women but that it is not sufficient to explain the increase in these injuries."
31020768,"In this study, we examine the frequency and severity of neck pain in a group of patients who have been involved in an auto accident and compare it to that of controls. We find that whiplash-induced neck injuries are more likely to lead to pain than other types of injury, but there is no association between these two groups."
25812929,"In this paper, Dr. Rivers focuses on the influence of psychological and physical factors on patients with lowback pain. He uses a cross-sectional survey to examine the association between psychological predictors of persistent pain and functional disability in patients who have had shoulder pain for three months. The results suggest that psychological factors are more strongly connected with persisting pain than those with neck pain; however, there is no significant difference in the treatment effect when measured with function, pain, and disability measure. This study will investigate whether the ""therapeutic alliance"" between physicians and patients suffering from low back pain can lead to better patient outcomes."
21398350,"In 62 patients, we found that a similar growth-hormonal effect was demonstrated on last observation height Sds. A doubleblind, placebo-control trial was performed to determine the efficacy of GH for short- statured children. The results were as follows: an increase in final height was observed after 4.4 years; no untoward changes on glucose metabolism or blood pressure were observed. Long- term therapy does not alter body fat distribution orblood pressure. Boys progress slightly faster throughpuberty, associated withan acceleration in bone age maturation. This study is based on an open label randomized treatment of 50 children with short statures who received either gh at 0.24mg/kg/wk or 0.3mb/week. After two years, the mean gain in height increased significantly in both groups. For example, when compared to the untreated control group, there was significant difference in initial height score between the treated group and the non-treated group. Both groups had rapid growth velocity. These conclusions suggest that long-term recombinant HGH may be more effective than conventional growth methods in treating children without adequate height."
23544806,"Preterm infants fed with Lactobacterus GG show significant reduction in Necrotising Enterocolitis compared to controls. In addition, the infant's stool contains lower levels of enterobacterium than those receiving placebo. A double blind r and Omized study examines the role of probiotics in preventing necrotic colonization in prematurely birthed babies. There is no significant difference in birth weight, treatment with an antibiotic, and the start time of breast feeding among the three group. The aim of this study was to determine whether boricination with lactobacilus reduces nosocomic infection in preterm children. Both groups were well tolerated; however, there was a significant increase in the incidence rate of nosotic infections in both groups. This study also examined whether or notlactobillus can prevent bowel permeability in low-birth-weight newborns."
31147627,"This study focuses on the association between body mass index, leptenin and adionectin concentrations with the risk of developing or surviving prostate cancer in men from Mendoza, Argentina. In this study, we find no significant relationship between blood levels of either peptide or lepleptin, but there is an unfavorable association for both groups. We conclude that hyperinsulinemia may lead to increased susceptibility to certain types of malignant disease, particularly those with high-risk predisposes. However, our results suggest that circulating glultine and leparin are not strongly associated with risk; only percent HMW did have such an association. Furthermore, these results do not seem to support any role in the development of prostatic disease. Adipokine has been shown to be involved in several different pathogenesis, including breast and prostate, although it does not appear to play any part in its role"
25953458,"The results of a large epidemiological study indicate that voice disorders are common and that there are several risk factors for their presence in the community. A cross-sectional phone survey is used to assess whether patients with voice problems report any physical or mental health problems. In this study, physicians use spectral analyzers to distinguish between Adsd and MTD as well as psychometric measures to determine whether experienced speech pathologist can distinguish AdSd/MTD from actual diagnoses. This study uses blinded assessment to evaluate the efficacy of Laryngesal Manual therapy on patients who have muscle tension dyspeakia. Although the severity and frequencyof VTD were shown to have declined after LMT, the treatment was not entirely effective. The aim presented in this paper is to develop single-case evidence levels; it also includes 14 quality questions to aid in critically evaluating single case studies. These questions include: inter-raterreliability for the total Score; interclass correlations for summary scores; perceptual values for each item; and consensus ratings between pair of rater"
25690684,"This study focuses on the reliability and validity of three measures of muscle spastity: resting position, resistance to active movement, and angle of appearance. The results indicate that the Mas is not valid and may not be sufficient for predicting spasticity at stroke. In contrast, the Modifiedashworth Scale, which uses a modified Ashworth scale, is highly reliable."
25560629,"The results of this study suggest that the use of a virtual-reality-based training program may be effective in improving gait and strength in patients with hemipaesis. A single blind, randomed control trial is conducted to evaluate gaits and balance function after training with an artificially-generated device. In the treatment group, falls are fewer than those in the delayed intervention group; however, there are no significant changes in stride length variability during the silent stance. This study also suggests that two-tongue tasking can improve balance skills in people with acquired brain injury. Two groups participate in ardor and physical therapy for 60 min each day while subjects receive only one task per week. Walking speed, community walk time, and walking ability test were measured at posttraining. Both groups received additional exercises from the experimental group as part of their regimen. They showed significant improvement on all selected gaital measures except for temperal symmetry."
23965711,"In this paper, we describe a novel approach to evaluating changes in the quality of life measured by the Foot Function Index. We use standardized measures to predict whether patients will respond to treatment and then relate these results to the severity of their injury. This new approach is especially useful for physicians who are planning new trials because it can be used to interpret patient-reported outcome measures."
12939895,"In this paper, we describe a doubleblind, randozed trial of 70 patients with primary and secondary skin infections. The efficacies of both treatments are described. A significant difference in pain is observed between the two treatment groups. Muprocin significantly reduces the severity of herpetic nervousgia by 82.6 percent after topical or 15.4 %) after oral aspirin. Both preparation were equally effective for cases where Gram negative or mixed Gram positive/Gram negative bacteria were isolated. Two preparations proved effectively clinically with 89  percentage of patients responding. This was the first time an antimicrobial agent has been used to treat primary skin infection. Because it is not well-established, the Food and Drug administration has recently proposed standardized methods for testing its efficacy on primary wounds. All cultures before and after drug therapy were taken using broth plus 10 -- % fetal bovine Serum to minimize antimobility "" carry over"" to the culture plates. These methods require comparison with the agents base and microbiological documentation ofefficacy. For example, Staphylucocco aureus isolates from 94 per cent of the patients treated before therapy. Although these methods do not provide adequate proof of efficiacy, they have demonstrated that their use can be superior to vehicle-based approaches."
23810272,"In this study, we examine the effects of a combination of infertile fertilization and ovescence on children born after an IVF treatment. We find no significant differences in intellectual functioning between the two groups until the age at 8 years. Children from cryopreservation receive better verbal ability than those from naturally-conceived children at 3 and 5, but their physical health does not cause concern. A population-based cohort is then used to compare the mental development of twins who have been conceived by assisted reproduction with that of controls during the first three years of life. The risk of death for singletons was similar to the risk for control children; however, there were some long-term illness in the control child's life as measured by disability allowance, long term medication use, and hospital visits. This study concludes that the method ""has no bad influence"" on the psychomotion of these children. All the children are well-behaved and do not have any signs of depression or feeding difficulties. Fourteen other children, born by donor egg, also undergo the same study. These studies show that all the infants develop very well under the care of their mothers."
24405725,"In this study, we examine the effect of an antidepressants regimen on pain intensity and activities interference in patients with knee pain. We find that the arm with the most effective treatment is associated with improved pain-intensity, activity interference, and quality of life. A second analysis is performed to determine whether self-efficiecacy, fear of motion, pain beliefs, age, gender, social support, physical function, or health related qualities predict pain severity. The results are compared with those obtained from other prospective studies. This study concludes that there is a strong association between pain at the time of the injury and depression two years later. It also suggests that psychological and social supports may be important risk factors for pain and depressed symptoms."
27487986,"This study focuses on the effects of long-chain, polyunstained fatty acids on cognition. It is shown that low-glyceic meals are associated with better performance on verbal memory and mood at nine-h after breakfast than high-glucorated meals. The results differ from those obtained in other studies because of differences in arousals and cortinsol secretions. In this current study, children were divided into two groups: one group was assigned to either ""a mixed grain"" or ""another regular diet."""
29445867,"This paper presents a controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of an electric current-sitting regimen for children with attention deficit disorder. The results show that this regimen is more effective than standard treatment in improving core symptoms and inducing improvements in other behavioural and mental functions. In addition, the study compares the effects of EEG-feedback on behavior in patients with ADHD who have not yet received conventional treatment."
24798823,"The purpose of the present study was to assess the value of Gait Speed, an efficacy measure for improving the predictability of mortality and Major Morbidity in older patients undergoing cardinal surgery. In this paper, we describe a cohort of 131 elderly patients who had been scheduled for heart surgery at age 70 or older. We aim to determine whether the minimal clinically important difference between comfortable gait speeds and the modified rankin scale scores for people between twenty- sixty days poststroke is associated with improved performance on the Modified Rankin Score. A secondary analysis of results from the Life-P study confirms that walking speed increases the risk of dying in old people. Furthermore, there are significant changes in walking pace when compared to other measures of health status. Two hundred seventeen female patients with hip fracture have been treated with diflucantin. These patients show modest improvement in their gaits speed after two weeks of treatment."
25001582,"A prospective, univariate analysis of the impact of various surgical techniques on Crohn's disease in terms of quality of live, direct and indirect cost. The results suggest that a long hospital stay is associated with complications at the third postoperative day. In addition, patients with severe or multiple chronic bowel disease have higher levels of social and professional life than controls. They are also more likely to attend school after six years than those without colitis. After seven years, however, only 7 p.m. are unemployed. A study of 170 men with ulcerative Colitis was first conducted in 1978. It found that patients who had severe symptoms were much better off than their peers with no symptoms. When they were older, they showed greater impairment in work and activities than other patients suffering from the same disease. This study concludes that it is the first complete cost study for crohn-disease in Germany. Costs ranged from early retirement or sickness leave to direct medical expenses."
29064384,"The purpose of this article was to determine the association between birth and menarche, a measure of early childhood growth. Girls who experience rapid growth have an average age that is 4.6 months later than girls who are not growing at all. This results in consistent results for percentile or conditional growth modeling. In boys and women, both height-for-ages z scores and body mass-index predict the path of puberty. Both height and weight gain before birth were found to be important predictors of late development. A prospective cohort study was followed from pregnancy to adulthood in which girls from the west Australian pregnancy were followed prospectively from fetil 18 hk of pregnancy up to mid-adoleescence. Women with higher bodies had greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes than those with lower bodies. However, there was no relationship between increased waist size during early life and early menarce."
27178217,"In this study, we examine the effect of a single daily dose of 25-Hyd on the severity of acute myosis in Mongolian children. The results suggest that treatment with 500mg of high-dose vitamin D may reduce the risk of spontaneous pneumonia in young patients. We also investigate the association between low concentrations of blood-soluble vitamins and the subsequent development of severe pneumonia among neonates."
28826406,"Predictive values of chronological Age and Frailty are used to select elderly persons at risk. The narrator uses the results of this study to determine whether frailties predict postoperative complications in older patients. After a prospective observational study, we conclude that pre-operative symptoms may be associated with increased risk for long-term morbidity after gastric surgery."
22006128,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates that the use of light-cured glass polymer cement in direct bonding to orthodontic braces leads to higher bond failures than with conventional resin-based cements. This is due to the fact that heavy arch wires are used to hold the brackets in place. The results suggest that both types of cement have greater bond strength than conventionally bonded materials. Decalcifying during orthodontic treatment can be a serious issue. A glass ioonomer and composite resin were used for directly bonded brackets; however, their failure rates were much higher than those of other methods. These results indicate that they may be useful for decalcification when using lightweight archwires as an alternative to traditional rigid material."
18489673,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether an educational intervention can reduce the intention to obtain a genetic test among women at high risk of breast disease. This intervention reduces the likelihood that women will seek out and receive testing from physicians, midwives, and other health care professionals. Furthermore, it shows that the use of multiplex-PCR for Duchesenne and Beckers muscular Dystrophies has been found to be more sensitive than single-expansion methods. In addition, patients with inherited breast diseases are less likely to make informed decisions regarding their treatment. A recent review suggests that using un published scales in medical trials may lead to significant results"
25966337,"The cost of prescription drugs in the elderly and welfare population are particularly high compared to that of patients with higher income. In addition, there is an increase in emergency department visits due to reduced use of essential medicines. This paper concludes that increasing cost-sharing among elderly people and those receiving social assistance is associated with reductions in drug use and costs. Conclusions In this paper, we find that increased price- sharing for prescription pills in elderly persons was followed by increases in useof essential drugs and more serious adverse events. Preparations for the Post-MI Freee trial are underway. All eligible patients will be block-rand-omized from full drug benefit to either full pharmacy benefit or current level of pharmacist benefit. Cost-effectiveness of the proposed rule on Medicare PartD prescription drug plans is under discussion."
31828538,"Non-alcoholic, non-suspicious liver disease is a frequent cause of morbidity among the general population. In this study, we examine the effects of carnintine on patients with suspected liver diseases. The results show that there is no significant difference in basal characteristics between the two treatment groups. After 12 months, the primary endpoint for the study is normalization of Alanine Aminotransferases at 3 months. Carnitine increases the mitochondrial copy number by increasing the amount of long chain fatty acids that are transferred into the cell. This effect seems to be due to the increased activity of the alkalinergic agent N-Ethyl/N'- Nitrosorea."
23558383,"In this paper, we describe the use of a novel technique for performing small-incision muscle biopsy in patients with obstrumental pulmonary disease. The Bergström technique is more comfortable than the other two methods, and the agreement between the two is moderate. Muscle fibers are similar in size to those of Caucasian and African runners. A significant increase in Type Muscul Dyscitis is an important problem in chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Stimulating the quadriced and hamlet muscles was delivered using 35 Hz. Both groups had significant improvements in physical exercise and cardiorespitory fitness from baseline until 24 months. There were conflicting reports about the effects of Hormone replacement therapy on strength preservation; however, no effect on power output has been reported. Postmenopauseal women showed less myofibersize, reduced mRNA level for myofibirillar proteins, increases proteolytic activities, lower myostin/acton ratio, virtually  regardless of insulin therapy. Blood pressure does not influence fiber composition or shape, but is correlated with greater fiber roundness among men. Men have larger type Ia and IIX muscle fiber areas than women with Ngembric glycogenation."
28024721,"In this study, we examine the effects of early treatment on patients' quality of life. We find that patients who are not able to maintain their good health after one year of treatment tend to have lower survival probabilities than those who do not. A prospective cohort study is designed to assess the predictors for long-term survival in elderly patients with breast cancer. The results indicate that there is a significant relationship between pre-operating depressive symptoms and post-treatment functional performance status. Pre-operative care was associated with improved outcome in older patients treated with surgical intervention. This study also identifies risk factors for head and neck malignant disease. It finds that high levels of self-efficacy were associated significantly with better survival."
30219553,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective, single institution pilot study to compare the safety and efficacy of using mechanical bowel preparation for elective coloredectal laxative surgery. The overall infection rate was 19.7% in patients who were treated with either mechanical or non-mechanical preparations. For example, there was no significant difference in the risk of anastotic leak, bleeding, or wound infection between groups that received both types of preparation. We conclude that ""implementation of such an ipb was successful in declining syphilis rates in color Ectortal surgery patients."""
21660022,"In this study, we examine the sensitivity of patients to cold in two different types of restorations. The subjects are divided into four groups: 1) patients who received class I or class II resin fillings; 2) those who were treated with either copal or dentin-absorbent material; and 3) those that were not treated at all. We conclude that there is no significant difference in the degree of post-opportunity between the two groups."
32028975,"In this paper, we describe the results of a single-blind, cluster-random controlled trial in Swiss child care. We found that 648 children were included at baseline and received an intervention consisting of daily physical activity, feeding, and building environment. At six months, 728 children had been provided with sufficient information for further analysis. The primary outcome was mean Vector magnitude counts/15 s. This study is important because it will help to identify potential mechanism for early childhood Emotional Capability. It also shows that there is no increase in heart rate or body weight with age. Furthermore, studies have shown that more time spent on screentime or limited physical activities are associated with fewer sleep days."
30211331,"This study focuses on attachment-related behavior in children with an extended diagnosis of autism. The results suggest that early detection and intervention can be used to improve the severity of the disease. Children who receive community-based treatment show significant improvements in their IQ, adaptive behavior, and severity at 13 months. In this study, we examine the effects of imitation on joint attention and language development in pre-kindergarcies with autism. We find that improvical music therapy is more effective than play sessions for improving social interaction in these children."
28060453,"This paper focuses on cost effectiveness of an additional 12 weeks of bupropion, varenicine, and placebo for smoking reduction. The results suggest that these treatments are more cost-effective than other forms of cessation therapy. It uses a decision tree model to predict the expected savings from each treatment over ten years. In addition, it compares the costs of different types of quit attempts in order to determine which method is most cost efficient."
19300236,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective, doubleblind, and placebo-controlled trial of prophylactics for the treatment of open fractures. After comparing the efficacy of single-dose antibiotics to standard care in patients with deep, superficial wounds, Wuthering Heights concludes that adequate use of these agents reduces the risk of infection in both acute and post-surgery settings."
25459568,"In this study, we compare the performance of a carbon fiber reinforced carbon post in combination with an all-metal composite crown for the treatment of teeth with fractures. The results suggest that conventional crowns fabricated using either cementite or glass fiber do not perform well in these cases. A prospective clinical trial is performed to evaluate the efficacy of two different types of posts: one made of light-curve composite and one composed of metal cores; both materials are used as anchors for endodonticly treated teeth.
