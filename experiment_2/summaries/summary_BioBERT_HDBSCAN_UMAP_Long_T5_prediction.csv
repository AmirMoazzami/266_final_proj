28514886,"In this paper, we describe the effects of a combination of short-chain gallacto-origosacchardes and long chain fructooligsacides on intestinal sensitivity of preterm babies. We determine that these two compounds may reduce the risk of serious infectious disease in premature infants because they can induce permeability between the gut and the lungs. Furthermore, it has been reported that their effect on the growth of newborns is not as strong as that of human milk. This paper also discusses the use of enteral supplements to prevent neonatal nosopatra from contracting hysteria. The study concludes by describing the results of an emaciated pregnant woman who was given three g/day of GOS or LcFOS at different concentrations during pregnancy. These subjects were then divided into four groups: control group, GOB1; PG4; and PGL1 with either one of the three levels of feed for each child."
18842808,"The effects of soluble fibers on serum concentrations in healthy men are investigated. After two weeks, crossover takes place and the subjects are given 3.9g glucomann or placebo for four wks. In this study, a total of 100 and 740 men and women received either active fiber material or another type of substance. All were found to have significant weight reduction than either treatment. Aim This paper compares the efficaciousness of adding glicomannan into re-efvalescent children's diets to reduce plasma lipoproteincholestrol levels. It is shown that Glucomarnan has remarkably positive effects on blood trigllycerides and cholesterol levels in patients with mildly hyperlipidemimic Type II disease."
24297836,"This study consists of two parts: 1) to examine whether subjects suffering acute mountain sickness, or AMS, during high altitude are at risk for developing this disease; and 2) to determine whether the autonomic functions of low-altitude individuals may be related to their susceptibility to develop a particular disease. Forty one mountaineers participate in an eight-hour ascent on Denali, Alaska's highest point. The results of the first experiment suggest that elevated plasma vegf is associated with increased severity of acute Mountain Sickness."
32367221,"This study describes the post-morbidity of ACL knee replacements in patients with cruciate Ligament deficiencies. The results are similar to those of other studies, but there is no comparison between autograft types. In this paper, we compare the functional outcome after single bundle Acclamation ligament reconstitution using quadricel tendon bone or quadruples Achilles tendinoes. We conclude that these two different methods will have little bearing on patient quality of life."
25038833,"In this study, we examine the effects of a combination of darifanacin and an extended-relief form on memory in older subjects. We conclude that these two drugs are associated with increased risk of mental decline and premature mortality in patients with advanced disease. A reduced score on the anticholineric drug scale improves short term memory but does not increase long term survival. Overactive bladder can lead to serious adverse events including brain injury. This study is designed to assess the effect of Darifenaciin on mild cognitive function in people without clinical dementia. It is based on three studies: one concerning acute stroke patients; another concerning elderly patients who have been prescribed excessive amounts of medicine due to their high blood pressure; and lastly, it is used to evaluate the relationship between cumulative doses of medication and changes in physical function."
16801507,"Several studies have shown the effect of glucocoticoid on bone loss, including one in which it was shown that parathyroid Hortense suppresses bones formation and improves bone reasorption. Another study showed that strontium Ranelate reduced the risk of fractures in older women. This study also examined whether high levels of vitamin K were associated with lower Bone Mineral Density. The results of this study suggest that higher levels are associated to lower bone mineral densities."
11676811,"In this paper, we examine the use of two-blind and double- blinded trials as controls for treatment of back pain. We find six different treatments that are reported in the literature. Forty four of 56 hospitalized patients found the treatment better than control regimens, but only ten of 50 were willing to agree on the same treatment. For each treatment, the treated patient in both groups was largely dependent on differences in outcome between the control groups. A clinical study is designed to investigate and compare effects of an exercise program on low back injuries in patients after one year training under the care of a physician. The results show that the intervention group improved over the other group by reducing the number of painful months from the previous period. Methods: To investigate how effective two different exercise exercises on lower back problems inpatients after 1year training program Under the supervision of Mr. physiotherapist; Context: This study assesses the effect of general fitness program performed by anoccupational health service using pre- post assessment for several different outcome measures. Pre-post medical check ups were conducted before the subjects were assigned to either exercise or control group. Most systematic reviews rely upon the assessment of methodological quality of individual trials. However, there is little evidence regarding the effectiveness of these methods in improving work performance."
12719681,"In this study, we examine whether quality of life scores can predict readmission or death within twelve months of an initial admission to the hospital. We also investigate whether exercise is associated with improved health in patients with moderate-to-severe airflow obstruction. A home-based exercise program is used to improve physical functioning and health-related qualities of living in women with stage I and II chest cancer. The results of this trial indicate that structured exercise at home may be more effective than usual care in improving lung function and exercise tolerance among patients who have severe air flow obstruction; however, there are still questions about whether these tools will suffer from missing information when used in community-owned groups. This study compares four instruments that measure overall qualityof life: the Rol and Morris Questionnaire, the Short Form 36 Physical Function Question, and the Asthmatic Quality of Life Survey. These instruments are not well suited for use in large-scale studies because they are too sensitive to changes over time."
26830881,"A long-term, naturalistic trial of patients with anxiety disorder compared the safety and efficacy for paroxamin and clonepam over a three-year treatment duration. In this study, we examine the effect of pre gabalin on sleep disturbances in patients who have panic disorder. The results suggest that there may be an association between the haplotype of serotonine transporter gene and the seroteon 2A receptor genes. This study is followed up by another study to determine whether quetiamipine can be used as maintenance therapy for patients suffering from generalized anxious disorder or other anxiety disorders. It was found that patients treated with imipramini were less likely to regain their symptoms after six months than those treated without it. Another study examined the effects of salivary changes during treatment on memory and executive functions in older adults. After two years of continuous treatment, all patients improved but no improvement was seen in the frequency of attacks. These studies are not related to any specific disease type."
28611377,"Anticoagulation treatment for strokes is recommended for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. In this study, we compared the effects of antithrombotic therapy in patients who had parosmal atrium fibrillation after an icemia. The results showed that there was a significant risk of death from early death among patients treated with subcutaneous warfarin. A total of three169 patients had persistent or paroxisal atary fibrilation; 7304 were assigned to UFh 12 500 i.s. B.D., 773 and 5000 u.S.B.d. and 1612 no-heparin subjects. Few epidemiological cohort studies have examined attributable causes of deaths and their predictores. Methods And Results - The Re-LY trial rand and Omized 18113 patients aged 71.5 years, male,64 %; Chads2 score : 2.11, p.1. Prespecified as ""net clinical benefit"" / all stroke's, systemic Emolism & Major Bleakness, and all cause-specific Mortality. This study uses echocardiography to determine the prevalence of tharic taotic plaque in people with attritial fibriliation. It also examines the relative risks of sudden death due to congestive Heart Failure."
28449030,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates that the indirect effects of one person's vaccination on another can be calculated using counterfactual theories. He uses cluster-randoment methods to predict the effect of two people in a single household with different levels of exposure to cholera. The first group receives an immediate dose of cholorera; the second group is given only after comparing the risk difference, risk ratio, and odds ratio between the two groups. This study also shows that insecticide treated bed nets are as strong as those without Nets in areas with high concentrations of mosquitoes. Two recent studies have found that women can reduce maternal mortality in poor countries. A case control study with 43 hospitals across Pennsylvania has shown that there is no direct or indirect protection from bacteremia. After examining the relationship between neighborhood-level immunition rates and protective efficiacy during recurrent periods, we assess the association betweenneigh- level vaccine Coverage and Protective efficacy at follow-up intervals controlling for confounding factors. Typhoisd fever is epidemic in Karachi, in Pakistan, where children receive Vicapsular Polysaccharde ""ViCPS"" before they get sick. Although influenza is highly endemic, it does not cause disease in many parts of the country. However, since the cost of pneumocolcal conjugatevaccines is prohibitive, some alternative strategies could be devised."
27888169,"This paper describes a new patient-centered web-based system for managing blood glucose in patients with Type 2 diabetes. It is designed to be ""voice-interactive,"" physician directed, and afforded to remote patients via touch-to-tone telephones. The goal of this system is to improve the quality of treatment by providing real-time information about blood sugar levels and other important health events. In addition, it will provide immediate advice regarding changes in lifestyle and meal planning. Acute complications from type 2 disease account for one third of the mortality differences between African Americans and white patients. We assess the effect on telemedicine care for older adults with type 1 and 2 types of disease. These patients receive regular care or an intervention that includes daily self-care support and monthly medication management Facilitation. All patients are assigned to receive either usual care plus/no intervention or standard care alone during the period of study. They were stratified according to their good and poor control of glucosycated hagin  8, % or within strata; they were then divided into two groups: those who received routine care and those whom received Web-base care management. After six months, all patients had improved their blood pressure, total cholesterol, HbA1, and LDL-cholesterol levels. There was no significant change in A1c values at 6 months. Other studies have reported that physicians' satisfaction with the practice of medicine is related to the capacity of medical information systems."
20088746,"In this paper, we describe the use and cost of cobalmin for treating patients with food-coblastic malabsorption. We study 10 patients who have been treated with 3000 or 5000mg of either 1 or 2 milligs of cyanomecin every week for at most 3 months. The results are very good. After three months, all blood counts, serum co balancemin levels, and recurculocytes were measured. Five patients in the patient group had folate deficiencies, which left eighteen eligible patients; in other words, they received both forms of treatment. A cross sectional survey was carried out to identify the uses of each type of therapy. All geriaticians, heatologists, general practitioners, pharmacists, etc. were asked to report on their use of different types of drugs. They reported that there was no difference in efficacy between the two groups. However, some studies showed that higher doses could be as effective as lower dosed. For example, one study found that it was more cost effective to use only low-dosed cobalamin than to administer it directly. This study also investigated the possibility of using an intranasolal form of chloroxocoplamin to treat elderly patients depleted of these nutrients."
27040323,"The GRADE approach is based on high-quality evidence, observational studies, and failures to conceal allocation, blindness, loss of followup, or inappropriate controls. However, the risk of bias in these studies may vary across results. In this study, we aim to determine whether probiotics can reduce mortality and enterococciin in preterm babies. We compare daily administration of an anti-Necrotizing Enterocotis combination with gentamycin sulferate in infants who are at least three months old. No cases of NEC develop during treatment; however, there are no cases among patients receiving IgA/IgG. Preterm infant deaths are associated with low birth weight. Necrotic enteromelitis is one of the most important risks for developing it in premature newborns. This trial evaluates the efficaciousness of two different forms of proliferinogen in preventing disease from occurring in very low-birth weight infant groups. One group uses oral immunoglogulin preparation while the other uses monomericin. Both regimens have significant effects on the severity of disease."
20379700,"This study consists of two parts: 1) a placebo-controlled, randomized, single-mean study to determine the effects of 10 weeks of exercise for osteoporis patients on pain, use of Analgesiometry, functional status, quality of Life, balance and Muscle strength. 2) A controlled trial to evaluate the effect of home-based exercises on back pain in elderly postmenopalisal women. In this study, 50 females aged 45-80 years old were assigned to either control or school groups. The subjects were divided according to their severity of their condition. After four years, they were randomly assigned into either group. Back pain was measured by T scores of double-earthquake absorpriometric measurements. Osteoprasis is common in the older population but many patients fail recovery from hip fractures. For example, an outpatient physical therapy program improves balance, strength, agility, and bone health among frail elderly people. However, specific exercise regimens that might be prescribed by physicians have not been studied."
28616252,"Pilot studies are designed to advance the safety and effectiveness of an intervention in a large-scale, expensive, or multicentre trial. These studies typically involve multiple subjects with different musculosities and are usually performed on fewer patients than planned. In this case, however, it is important to conduct pilot studies prior to the actual main study so as to ensure that the proposed treatment or intervention will be safe, efficacious, and cost-effective. This paper describes the most common types of pilot trials used for phase III: 1) pre-proposal studies; 2) proof-ofconcept studies -- which describe how the results of these studies can be used to predict whether or not the new treatment will work; and 3) ""vanguard,"" which refers to studies that have been conducted before the main trial but do not directly relate to any particular aspect of the project. Although many aspects affect the success of such studies, they are often considered synonymous. Feasure and pilotstudies play an important part in the preparation of major trials because they provide information about the potential for effective implementation and validity when compared to plans for larger, more expensive RCTs. A primary Purpose of Featsibility and Pilot Studies is to assess what effect various factors may have on the successful execution of 'the proposed main experiment' and to reduce threat to its validity. The purpose Of most feasibility and test studies should be described regarding information and evidence concerning the successfully implementation/validity of their proposed principal intervention studies. Null hypotheses significance testing is inappropriate for these surveys unless the samples size is properly powered"
30045708,"This case series focuses on the effects of myofscial triggerpoints on pain and pressure sensitiveness in patients with unilateral shoulder pain. Twelve patients attended four sessions for two weeks, and they received Trp pressure release and nervemuscular treatments over each active trunk that was found. Pain was measured pre-intervention; at a month follow-up, whereas Post-treatment were assessed pre/ and post- treatment and at an 1-month follow up. Aim To investigate the frequency of Latent and activeMyofascia trigger point in the neck as well as upperback muscles in subjects with cervical radculopathy or healthy subjects."" In this study, we assess the effect of including one session of trigger points dry needling into physiotherapy to improve pain after postoperative shoulder injury. The results show that subjects receive better physical therapy than those receiving only ""trP-DN"" alone. We also examine the association between headaches and the presence of these trigger spots in other areas of the body, such as the sternnocleido Mastoid Neck, trapezius, head posture, neck range Of Motion, facet joint softness."
31760943,"In this study, we investigate the effects of a high resistance starch, ham-rs2, on blood glucose and insulin resistance in type 2 patients with Type 2 diabetes. We examine changes in satity, body composition, and biomarkers for glyceric control after HAM'Rs2 consumption. The primary aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of resistant starches on fasting or postpr/and ial Glycemic Marks in adults at elevated risk of Type 2, Diabetes Mellitus. Aim: To determine the efficacy of resistant starchism as an anti-tumorous treatment in Type 1, Diabetes mellitis patients. Methods All 40 patients were divided into two different groups: group A received ruminant Starch for ahead of four weeks while group B was given placebo. Blood was collected the first day; on the next day, it was taken from each stage. After three metabolic investigations, they attended for three Metabolic Investigations. At end of every intervention period, participants attendedfor threemetabolic investigations."" On the one hand, there was little effect that RS had on either sensitivity or severity of T1D but no effect on HbB1c or on hepatic or peripheral insulinsensitivity. This study also examined whether certain purified ""indigestible carbs"" could improve gut-derived Hormones involved in both inflammation and obstructiveness. It was concluded that these compounds would be useful in treating Type 1diabetes."
24717371,"Iron depletion has been reported to improve endurance performance in animals, but the consequences for human health remain unclear. Women with iron depleted are randored and assigned either 100mg FeSO or a ""placebo"" twice daily for six wk. In this study, we examine the effect on endurance capacity of women with anemia who have low levels of ferritin. The results indicate that there is no significant difference in body size, body composition, physical activity-level,  diet, delta efficiency, or exhaustion. This study also investigates the effects of blood donation on iron status. After reletion, patients receive two weeks of iron treatment. Both groups increase their total iron-bounding capacity by about 2 percent. A further study is performed on female cross country runners using high-dose iron supplementation. Results suggest that these subjects do not experience any detrimental effects on their endurance abilities."
26005199,"A rand-omized control trial suggests that an eight-week meditation intervention may be efficacious for improving symptoms, functional deficiencies and coping ability in fibroyalgiA. This study is a prospective, sfeasily-controlled trial to evaluate the effects of an Eight-Week Mindfulness-Reduction program on perceived stress as well as psychological well being among 58 women with grognathous pain. The results suggest that this program can be used to treat patients with chronic pain, fatigue, and insomnia."
29353323,"In this study, we examine the effects of stimulant medication on academic performance in children with attention deficit hyperactive disorder. We compared two different forms of MPH: immediate-release and delayed-relieved. The first form was used to treat children who had an acute response to short-acting drugs but were not yet ready for long-term treatment; the second use was intended to be more rapid-effective. This paper is designed to determine whether or not extended- release versions of MethYlphenidate are as effective as conventionally-dosed preparations. It uses a double blinded, crossover design to compare efficacy among three different types of pills: 1) Meta date CD, 2) methylphade HCl, 3) sustained-releasing capsules 4) and 5) Concerta, which has been shown to produce similar effects. A further study is performed to assess the effect of mh on reading performance when subjects with ADHD were treated with either daily or weekly doses of medicine. Although both studies showed significant improvements in performance, they did not show any differences between them."
27473099,"In this paper, we describe a pilot study to determine the incidence of various types of injuries in an urban sleeper's community in India. The injury incidence is 127 per thousand persons for all injuries and 117 per 1000 for males and females. A population-based cohort studies were done to estimate how many different kinds of accidents could be expected during one year of follow up. All injuries were 129 per 1,000 persons; for men 137 per1000 and for female only 118 Per 1000 persons. An experiment will be designed to test whether it would improve underst or the market for child care in Saudi Arabia. This pilot will provide details on the groups that should be tested, appropriate levels of the subsidy, and the location of daycare centers. Expecting impact Determine the effect of facilitating child access on Saudi woman'S employment."
26739716,"In this paper, the authors present a series of Danish health surveys that have been conducted every six to seven years. They include only those who took part in an interview or the postal question-naire. The purpose of this study is to determine whether psychological factors predict persistent or repeating pain in patients with new shoulder pain or chronic low back discomfort. A patient population was divided into two groups: 1) subjects with acute and subacute neck pain; 2) subjects without symptoms but with no specific pain at the beginning of the study; and 3) subjects receiving spinal manipulation for 4 weeks. Although some patients did not respond to spine manipulation, it would be useful for doctors to use these measures to identify patients likely to respond"
29318741,"In this paper, we examine the effect of using magnifying loupes while performing a series of dental procedures to improve student posture. We hypothesize that by using magnifying glasses during the treatment of patients, students will be able to reduce the risk of developing work-related shoulder pain. This study is based on two published reviews and uses Rayyan, an app that helps speed up the process of searching for evidence in multiple studies. The main aim of this research is to evaluate the relationship between neck pain as well as work related physical load with pain in dentists and hyggienics. It was found that there were significant differences in the patient's posture when compared to those of other patients. A second study was performed to assess the performance of pre-clinical operative students who had been taught how to use the seats provided by the manufacturer of stools. These students were trained in their use of the seat. Both tools were validated against one another in terms of their methodological quality."
23236190,"In this study, we examine the efficaciousness of mud packs as an alternative treatment for knee osteoarthritis. We compare the results of two different treatments: 1) a conventional regimen of daily baths and 2) short wave therapy. The results show that both approaches have significant symptomatic improvements in the short term. This is important because it suggests that spa therapy may be more effective than other forms of treatment."
22575611,"In this first study, we describe the effects of la motrigine and gabapanepine on patients with bi-polar I disorder. The results suggest that divalprox may be more effective than other mood-stabilers in reducing the severity of symptoms in patients who have been depressed for longer than six weeks. Bipolar depression is characterized by an overly sensitive response to both antidepressives and lithium. A second study reports the efficaciousness of alprax in treating bipolar II disease. This study compares the effectiveness of two different forms of maintenance therapy: levetiracetesam and carbamazescene. Both are shown to be as effective as either form of treatment."
30113661,"This study focuses on the effects of probiotic consumption on serum calcium, iron, and liver function in patients with Type 2 diabetes. In this paper, we describe a double-blinded, parallel- group, controlled trial to determine the effect of Probiotics on Renal Profile and Liver Function in Type 2, diabetic patients. The results are mixed: subjects receive either an intervention or placebo for 28 weeks; both groups follow an energy balanced diet and exercise recommendations. Nonalcoholic fat liver disease is one of the common chronic liver diseases in the world. Oral treatment has been suggested as an efficacy in treating it. However, there is no concluding evidence regarding its effectiveness in improving blood pressure and other indices in type 2 diastitious patients who have not yet received any medical treatment."
30511328,"In this paper, we describe the effects of a small-sized meal on weight loss and improvement in body composition in patients with Type 2 diabetes. We conclude that metformedin can reduce weight and improves hypertension without type 2 disease. This study is based on randoed doubleblind placebocontrolled trial among 100 severely obese children aged 6 to 12 years who were insulin-resistant. After six months of lifestyle intervention, all children and parents were able to lose weight. The results of this study are described in detail. It was found that both metformin as well as other drugs had significant effects on blood pressure, fat, and cell mass. Aiming to compare the effect of three different drug regimens on generalized or abdominal obesity, our study was performed among 180 subjects aged 10-16 years. They were divided into four groups of equal numbers to receive either met formin, flux / combination of thetwo drugs or placebo. These subjects were then assigned to either group of two drugs for an extended period of time. At the end of their treatment, they lost more than half their weight but did not experience any changes in their health."
17595425,"The purpose of this paper is to assess the reliability and predictability of the Stratify fall risk assessment tool used in patients recovering from an acute stroke. This study consists of two groups: first, a group consisting of patients who are at high risk for falling and second, another group composed of those who do not fall but have other risk factors. The results of these studies indicate that the use of multiple intervention strategies can reduce falls in older patients. In addition, the effectiveness of several different approaches to risk prediction has been found. For example, one approach uses sensitivity and exactity to predict falls while another uses logistic regression to calculate the relative risk of each patient."
23324965,"In this paper, we describe the results of 162 hips who received a Charnley elite-plus stem for total hip replacement. The mean patient follow-up is eight years and after that, the mean radiographic follow up is 6.5 years. This study was one of the few studies documenting long-term success of an arthroplasty performed with cement in patients under 15 years old. It was first published in the early 1990s. After fifteen years, only two revisions were performed because of looseness of either the cup or the stem. There are other studies on the incidence of Osteolysis and survival of cementless complete hip replacements. We compare the wear and tear of both types of replacements at different intervals of followup. A comparison between cementfree and cemented components was made. At least half of these composites had bone degradation."
23771266,"In this paper, we describe the efficaciousness of a two-week treatment of patients with rheurmal disease. We conclude that it is possible to use mud baths as an anti-inflammatory agent in treating pain and sleep. This study aims to investigate the effect of balaneotherapy on Fibromyalsgia symptoms. Thirteen patients were assigned to either group 1 or group 2; they received 20min bathing twice p.m. daily for five days. The aim was to determine whether combined therapy with Puld ultrasound and interferntial current could improve their pain scores. Seventeen female patients fulfilled FM criteria were split into two groups: CTPI and Sham. They were divided into three groups according to their age. Their pain was measured by body map, tender point count, and pain intensity. Tender points were assessed by inventory/polsomnography. Fifteen women were given different groups depending on their diagnoses. Both groups had different levels of pain severity. Acuponment was performed by blinded authors."
25442969,"In this paper, we develop novel mixed-effects modeling to examine the roles of health traits in the status of close friendship nomasures in a heart study. We find that people with similar health characteristics are more likely than others to dissolve existing friendships and form new ones. For example, smoking is less likely to dissociate from BMI because it is immutable. People with different health qualities are also most likely not to form any new tie between them. Social networks are highly organized and often act as if they are dynamic. This allows individuals to respond to changes in other people's behavior by breaking or making new connections. In addition, social networks can be used to create conditions for cooperative and uncooperative behavior. Theorematically, there have been no experiments on how people respond when they interact with other humans. Here, however, an experiment using r and Om graph modeling shows that subjects who play public goods games tend to be affected by other groups members' contribution in future interactions."
29508661,"In this study, we describe the fixation and movement of a new type of knee prosthesis, the Triathlon-Melty system. We report that it is possible to move the prosthese in one direction or the other without loosening. The results are similar for both groups at four years. This study compares the early migrating of the triathlon series with those of conventional knee replacements. It is reported that there is no difference in rotation around three coordinal axes during the two years follow-up. A previous study showed that the cement used to cement the tial component of total knee surgery was superior to the fixed bearing design on long term fixations. However, after several patients had been treated with cemented cement, they were found to be failing. Another study examined the effect of bone cement placed under an hysterical protruded torso as well as the effects of cement on the migration of its part. These studies suggest that cement may improve the stability of these devices."
25162440,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective, observational study in which patients with acute mesocolc or pelvitic abscessed are treated with an interval appendicement. The outcome is favorable for both groups: ""In-group 1,"" patients who have recurrent bouts of abdominal pain require immediate appendectomy; in- group 2, patients without such an intervention receive rapid recovery. We also discuss the use of percutaneous draining as an alternative to initial conservative treatment because it can be used to treat acutelyappendiced masses without risk of complications."
29359958,"In this paper, we describe a prospective study of the efficacy of reveratrol to treat non-alcoholicfatty liver disease in patients with transsaminaemia and histotype. We conclude that randal is associated with increased glycemia, reduced glucose resistance, and hypertriacelgycerolae. The aim was to test the effect of repeated doses of either rectinox or ointment on blood pressure, arterial stiffness, as well as other risk factors for Type 2 diabetes Mellitus. This trial was conducted in 66 patients who had been treated with ardent antidiabetic treatment. They were then given 200mg/day reasverate plus 8 mg per day. After 6 months, they were compared with their baseline levels. Resverratrol significantly improved blood sugar control in subjects with Type 1 Diabetes. Metabolic Syndrome is related to low-grade inflammation which may harm bone. Aarhus university hospital was conducting this study as if he were blinded. It was aimed at evaluating effects of Rvira on bone turnover markers, bone mineral density, body mass index, etc."
31521554,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of exercise on people with Parkinson's disease. He uses a fall risk score as an outcome measure to determine whether exercise can be used to prevent falls in people who are at risk for falling. The results of the study indicate that exercise is safe and effective for patients with PD. Anderson concludes by stating that it is difficult to predict whether someone will fall because of their disease until they know how much time they spend walking or doing other activities. This paper also discusses the use of motion-tracking devices such as the Berg balance scale to track changes in gait and balance in subjects with severe motor loss."
23958262,"In this study, we investigate the effects of a peroxisome proteolysis-activated signaling agonist on monocytes. We examine the changes in blood concentrations and function of fat cell secreted by obese subjects. The effect of piglitazen on thiasolinedione is thought to be through peroxidsome prolifereator-active receptor-gammala, which is abundant in afflicted tissue. This study also involves the use of Fenofisibrate as an exercise escort for patients with Type 2 diabetes who are at high risk of heart disease. It was found that fenifiberate reduced total cholesterol, Non-HDLcholestrol, Apoloprotein B, and Triglycerdes while improving HDL levels. Furthermore, it showed that being able to improve endotriumal function by increasing insulinsensitivity could lead to improved myochondrial function."
31860103,"In this paper, we describe the results of a double blind placebo-controlled study in which patients with heart failing were given 100000 IU of daily vitamin D1 or placebo. After six months, they measured their quality of life, physical function, and bone mineral density. They found that both regimens had similar effects on hip fracture risk. The main aim of the study is to determine whether high doses of Vitamin D can prevent fractures among older people who are at greatest risk of fracture. We conclude that there is little evidence for an effect of higher levels of 25HhD on fracture rate but that it should be further studied in future trials. This trial compares the effects of four monthly dosages from three different sources: 1,500 iu/d, 1,800 ml, or 2,600 nmol per day. It was concluded that all three treatments had significant increases in blood concentrations associated with lower disease risks. These studies have been published in several journals. A large number of community-downing elderly women aged 70 years old live in Perth, Australia, living in Long-Term Care Facilities. Two programs for prevention of Osteoprorosis represent major public health problems. One program uses elde calculitol as compared to Alfacalcol; the other uses calcium citrate. All three intervention groups showed increased bone Mineral Density after 6 months. Both groups also showed marked increase in falls and fracture rates. There was no association between serum-25H HD concentration's and total mortality. Although some studies suggest that low levels may lead to greater injury, others indicate that these two factors do not seem to be related. For example, one study suggests that adding 500 ions of vitamin C every three months reduces hip injuries in older men. Another study reports that taking 1,000 ng. erygocalcifererol each week improves muscle mass and strength in healthy older adults. Furthermore, many studies report that increasing 25OHD levels might reduce the frequency of fallers. However, none of these studies show any effect on either improving ankle functions or decreasing fracture severity. Finally, another study investigates how long individuals receive 1000 p.m. caviar plus 800 vilevitamin D over five years. Our conclusion is that our findings need further investigation."
15289592,"A clinical trial is performed in a large hospital to evaluate the efficiacy of two different preventive measures: 1) lumbar support and 2) education. The results show that both groups have significant reductions in pain for at least three months. In addition, there are no significant differences in perceived physical effort at work. This paper also discusses the use of back belts as an alternative to wearing braces in the hope of preventing back pain."
24855158,"This paper describes a novel approach to improving the health of patients with Type 2 diabetes by using an ""electrified-friendly"" approach that involves physicians providing brief self-management education and lifestyle counseling. In this study, we examine the effects of telemedicine on improved patient satisfaction and quality of life. We conclude that if people with type 2, who are not infected with disease, can learn how to manage their disease through technology, then they will be better able to control their blood glucose."
29943231,"In this study, we examine the injury incidence of international rowers and identify risk factors associated with injury. We also examine injuries among young high-ranking players from various team or individual sports. A total of 113 injuries were reported during the study term; mean injury rate was 6.67 injuries per 1,000 hours. This study is designed to investigate injury in young professional football players by comparing injury severity and time loss over two seasons. The frequencyof injuries was not evenly distributed by playing position as forwards/ central defender sustained the greatest amount of injury episodes but the highest match absent. Many studies have examined injury rates in professional unions but few have found out about the influence that previous short-live or longer-time match exposures have upon injury risk. Methods We conducted 'a seven-year. n = 1253 English Premiership professional players' and compared their injury intensity and duration against injury risks using a prescriptive frailtiness model and magnitudebased inference"
29596560,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates the efficacy and safety of an eight-week hypnosis program on wound healing in patients who have been pre-operable for tattoos. The results suggest that it is possible to improve wound health by ""empathetic patient-centered"" approaches, which involve self-esteem, social support, and pain relief. Wound infection occurs after clean surgery, but warming patients before surgery reduces infection rates. A recent study suggests that expressive writing may speed wound reapheliaation in healthy older adults. Postoperative wound infections are particularly dangerous because they increase morbidity as well as mortality."
22723585,"In this paper, we examine the effect of a high-fructose diet on fasting and blood glucose concentration in type 2 patients. We conclude that excessive energy consumption may increase levels of both insulin and free IGF-i, which may lead to some Western-related diseases."
26420387,"In this paper, the relationship between bone mineral density and fracture risk is examined in a Swedish population. The results suggest that calcium may prevent fractures in older women. A double blinded trial of four years of calcium-calcium citrate or placebo reduces the rate of hip fracture by reducing the frequency of fracture for men and women with low body weight. This study also determines whether dietary changes are associated with reduced fracture risks in elderly women who have one or more disease-causing riskfactors. It also examines how long it takes to gain effect from different types of dietary change. Calcium has been used as an effective treatment for hip injuries since its popularity among the elderly. However, many studies have found no concluding evidence for its efficacy."
27416628,"In this study, we examine the effect of a fish oil-containing 280mg. docosainsahexanoic acid/110mc.eicospentataenoici acid or control from birth to six months of age upon infant allergic disease. The results suggest that high prenatal levels of vitamin D may reduce childhood wheezeing. We also investigate the association between maternal and infant dietary sources of antigens during pregnancy and on the risk of asthma. Antigen avoidance is known to affect fetal immunity and can lead to an increased risk for severe allergic diseases. A probiotic was found to be especially effective in the treatment of children with asthma because it prevented milk from being contaminated with pathogens. This paper discusses the protective effects of extended breast feeding on sensitsion in young children."
25767138,"In this study, we examine the effects of strength training on functional fitness in patients with moderate-to-severe obstrumental disease. Twenty patients are assigned to either an endurance-based or resistance training program. The results of the exercise trial show that both regimens produce significant changes in health and function in older patients who have been treated with conventional pulmonary rehabilitation. We also find that strengthtraining is more effective in improving performance in people with chronic  Obstructive Pulmonary Disease."
25431555,"In this paper, we describe a pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy in individualized electrode-egfriction training for children with hyperactivity disorder. Fourteen patients were randomly assigned to either EEG-feedback group or placebo group. The results of the trial indicate that both groups have significant reductions in symptoms of ADHD. A double blinded placebo-control study is performed to assess the effect of electroencephagraphic-neurostearography on treatment of attention-deprived/hyperactivité disorder in children aged 8 to 15 years. This study was designed to compare the effcacy of combined Egegy-Neurofeedbraid treatment with standard pharmacological intervention in thetreatment of adulthood-depleted children who had been previously treated with drug treatment. It found that combination treatment resulteved in significant improvements in primary symptoms as well as improvement in other behavioural and mental functions."
30854594,"Probiotics may help to treat a variety of conditions, including multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In this paper, we describe the effects of two probiotic strains on various inflammatory and immune-related diseases in patients with no gastrointestinal disease. We also present rand and ommized double- blinded placebo-control trials in which subjects were assigned to either group of four different groups: 1) one capsule of Lactobacterium acidophilus NCC3001, 2) one pill of Streptococcitin thermophilus, 3) or both; for 12 weeks. This study was designed to evaluate the efficaciousness of probioctic compounds in treating multiple chronic bowel disease as well as other complicational problems. The results of the studies are described in detail. These include an investigation of gut permeabilities and inflammation in people with multiple Organ Dyspancy Syndrome. Aiming to improve blood flow through the intestines by improving intestinal barrier function, probotics have been used to induce systemic inflammation. Furthermore, they have shown beneficial effects on Type 2 diabetes. However, there is still little evidence regarding their effect on type 2 complications."
27405704,"In this paper, we describe a prospective, long-term study of the effects of genetic risk testing on type 2 diabetes. We examine the performance of two risk models -- the Cambridge Type 2 Diabetes Risk Score and the Frammingham Offspring Study -- that predict whether future cases of new onset disease will result in improved health behavior. This study is designed to determine whether or not people who test for their genomic risk can benefit from lifestyle changes. The results of these studies suggest that there may be some potential for improving physical health by incorporating genetic information into pre-disciplined diets."
25985235,"The aim of this paper is to determine whether a morphine necessary for energy-metabolism and essential  fat anabolism might help attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder. A preliminary study in ADHD showed significant benefit, with the use of acetryl-L Carnitine showing significant improvement in children with symptoms of severe attention deficit disorder who had been ally-diagnosed with ADHD. In another study, 17 boys with FXS disease were treated with LAC over one year. This treatment was shown to improve their home behavior as well as school behavior. Another study was performed on 40 patients with attention-deprived or hyperactive disorder that had previously been treated by placebo. These patients showed improved performance on the teacher and parent assessment scales. They also showed reduced phosphoramosolic levels in the ACETYL-LCARNITE-treated patients but not in those treated without it."
32382836,"This paper describes the results of a large, open-labeled, parallel- group, pragmatic trial on patients with second- and three-degree haorrhoids. In this study, we compare the efficaciousness of two different surgical approaches for treating these patients: transanal Haemorring Dearterializing or stapled anodyssey. The outcome of the first trial is that the treatment of third-degret haemoorids is more cost-effective than the other two approaches. We also describe the use of ""hal"" to treat low-grade haerrharoids."
24392600,"This is a first-in-man study to evaluate the association between psychological and social-envirmental factors and type 2 diabetes control. The results of this study suggest that diet, exercise, and medication taking are important predictors of Type 2 blood pressure and lipids. A six-month intervention was found to improve both health status and self-care in African American adults with Type 1 diabetes. In addition, the intervention resulted in significant reductions in body mass index and blood sugar levels among the patients who received it."
25142703,"The aim of this study is to determine whether patients with sleep-absorption disorder receive a significant reduction in both fatigue and vigor when they are treated with continuous positive airways pressure. In addition, the patients who receive treatment show significant improvements in their symptoms as compared to those receiving placebo. Brain Snack: Cognitive complaints are frequently reported after breastcancer treatments. These include anxiety, depression, and insomnia. A recent study suggests that an intervention for insomnia may be more effective than waitlist control in improving these symptoms. This study also investigates whether an ""internet-delivering"" cognitive behavior therapy could reduce psychological and fatigue problems in women with early-stage breast cancer."
29856237,"In this study, we examine the efficacy of nurse-leaned follow-up on blood pressure and LDLc levels after stroke in patients with a high risk of stroke. We conclude that organized care is more effective than usual care for improving these two risk factors at one year after treatment. Nirz et al. A pilot study was designed to determine whether an individualized nursing intervention would improve health status after acute stroke or post-traumatic attack. The results were mixed: there was no significant difference in the rate of improvement in either outcome between the intervention group and control group; however, both groups had improved their scores on the National Institutesof Health Stroketic Score. This study also included interdisciplinary approaches to patient management. It showed that patients who received regular care did not have better outcomes than those who got nurse led care."
32201245,"In this study, we examine the effect of a single dose of Nigelle sativea on liver function in rats. The results show that there is no significant increase in blood ALT or aspartate glutathiase between treatment groups. Hypertension is an idly-related disease and diet changes are effective for it. A doubleblind, placebo-control trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of two different forms of N. Sativa extract on patients with mild hypertension. Both groups showed marked reductions in their blood pressure after eight weeks of treatment. Carumcarvi L. has been used as an anti-inflammatory agent in several medical conditions including hypertensive disease. This study investigates the safety and effectiveness of caraway ointment in treating Type 2 diabetic patients. It was found that both groups received significantly better pain relief than placebo. Another study investigated the use of black seed by treating patients who had severe renal stones."
25828270,"The effect of enfranchise on the risk of deep vein throbsis is investigated in patients with isolated hyperlipidemia. In this study, we investigate the effects of bezefibate 200mg per day on plasma levels as well as activities of bleeding risk factors in Type IIb/IV hyperlipophosphoaemia and Type 2d-dysiamic subjects. Bezafivebrate significantly reduces both trigllycerides and total cholesterol but does not affect Apo B or Apomecinogen levels. Amputations are common in people with Type 1D-mellitus, which impairs quality of life"
31483070,"This study consists of three groups: the first group is comprised of 75 women with over active bladders, the second group consisting of 30 women in two groups, and the third group includes 50 women who have been treated with either transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation or combination therapy. The results are similar before treatment. In this study, patients were divided into four groups according to their severity of their symptoms. After 12 weeks, they were able to improve their urinary frequency, urgency, quality of life, as well as other measures of health-related satisfaction. Aim To assess the effectiveness and safety of Weng-Li-Tong as monothérapie or combined withtoltersodine for overactive Bladger Syndrome. Methods An attempt was made to compare the effects of percutaneous needle electrodes on female patients with excessive bladder disease. It was found that there was a significant reduction in number of daily Micturitions, Urgency episodes, Pads used, Overactive bladder Symptom Score, etc. Furthermore, both groups showed improved efficacy when compared to placebo. Thus, we conclude that solifenacn 5m plus mirabgron-25 or 50 mg may be superior to monotherapy in treating overly activebladder syndrome."
25354945,"In this paper, we examine the effect of rhological properties on gastric emptyation in healthy volunteers. We conclude that food has a stronger content than its liquid equivalent, but it is unknown whether adding milk to tea or coffee would have similar effects on appetite. The study also determines whether an interval of six h before anaesthesia is sufficient to induce gastatic emptying. A multicentre European study was conducted over ten years from May 2010 until May 2011 in two French cities. This study investigated the effects of ""caloric content"" and the natureof calories on the rate at which stomach contents were emptyed. Gastric aspirations were performed in three cohorts; one group had babies who had been born between 15-days and 10 years; the other studied patients with GER. Both groups showed general convervalance in their results. Aspiration PIO continues to be complicational, however, there is no reliable tool for predicting gaster volume."
22525963,"Estrogens and Hormones in Post-menopause Women During the Menopatraal Transition Estrone, estron, Dhea, and free T are positively associated with Type 2 Diabetes. A study of 1612 women aged 45-84 years who were not receiving any type of steroid treatment was conducted. In this study, we examined the association between endogenous testogens such as testosterone and estreone with incident Type 2, diabetes. We also investigated whether ophorectomy for menopardized women is related to increased risk of bone fractures. This study uses population-based blood samples from 1423 women over the age of 75. The results suggest that there may be a positive relationship between estrogen levels and well being in middle-age women. However, it does not yet seem clear whether these changes are independent of age or other risk factors."
29760253,"Twenty-four patients with insomnia who have been using benzodyzepine for at least six months are enrolled in a double blind, controlled clinical study. The results of the study suggest that substituting zingopiclon as an hynotic may be more effective than placebo in relieving sleep disturbances among chronic flunitravepam-using patients. In this study, we assess the effects on sleep quality and anxiety during the initial 5 weeks of ZOP's withdrawal program. We conclude that it is not sufficient to stop use of zobiclone; however, there is evidence that switching from hypnotism to another class of drug will reduce these problems. A multicentred three-arm Cluster rand and ommized controlled trial was performed, with re and Omised at general practitioner levels. This study investigated whether switching patients from ""previous  Hynopis"" to cycloproprolone would reduce their sleep difficulties. One hundred thirty- four patients were assigned to one ofthree methods of switching between tinnos or cyclopyrolione. These methods were gap, an interval between treating the two drugs, i.e. taking zypicllone immediately upon stopping previous drug, and overlap gradually reducing preceding drug after starting new drug. Brain Snack: Many people report having trouble sleeping under stress because they do not know how to sleep well. There are weaker associations between self- reported sleep troubles and subsequent depression and mental health problems in medical school. BCGOBUND Long- term use has never been studied. However, several studies have suggested that tapering off short-lived Benzoralzepane use can lead to improvements in patients' daily functioning. CBT is used for insomnia. Forty-three adults aged greater than 65 years receive repeated prescriptions for long-term uses of alcohol. They are divided into two groups according to their age. Each group receives either supervised or waitlist control treatment. For older adults, both groups receive sedatives. Both groups experience significant improvement in their performance over the course of their follow-up periods."
26055921,"The aim of this study is to determine whether a diet high in folate, B12, and/or vitamin B 12 is associated with reduced depressive symptoms in older adults. In this population-based study, we examine the association between vitamins B 6, B 12, and folic acid levels as predictors of depression over an age range of 7.2 years. We conclude that there is little evidence from population studies of older people for the role of folute, blood-choleroyle, or homocystee levels in late-life mood disturbances."
29238651,"In this study, we describe the efficaciousness of quetiamipine in a patient sample with panic disorder. We conclude that it is possible to use such an extended-release drug as paronoxetine for patients with severe panic disorders. A long-term coadministration trial compares the safety and effectiveness of two different antipsychotics: clonalzepam at 2mg/d versus 40mcg peroxeten over 'a three-year total treatment period'. The results are similar to those of other studies. Panic Disorder has been related by abnormal balance system functions. Vision influences balanced and behavioural adaptations; peripheral vision influence orienting or fast defensive reactions;whereas central vision examines details of object. Agoration in panic disease has also been associated with abnormalities in brain function. Although no evidence exists on the effects of serotonine reupTake inhibitors, however, several studies have suggested that they may be effective in treating these patients. For example, one study suggests that parodytine might be more effective than randrenergic agents in the management of panic illness. Another study reports that exercise improves anxiety symptoms significantly sooner and more effectively in patients suffering from panic condition. Brain Snack: Cognitive behavior therapy was first used in many patients who had failed to respond fully to conventional treatments. However, some studies suggest that switching to psychotherapies can be advantageous. This study uses acceptance and commitment theory to assess the effect of short-time breathing therapy on acute anxiety and panic attacks."
23650680,"A case-controlled study of a patient's risk of developing ovarian disease was performed in London between October 1978 to February 1983. The menstrual characteristics, contraceptive uses, and other factors were all independently associated with an increased risk for ovarian cancer. Infertile women had fewer risks than those who did not have the same risk. Women with high gravidness, hyersterectomy, female stewardship, or use of contraception were more likely to develop recurral disease after treatment with platinum-based therapy. However, patients with stage I or III ostolican tumors were treated with either three or four cycles of modified bleedomycin 15mg/m.iv. After surgical treatment, no patients were lost to following-up. This study is designed to assess the safety and efficiacy of two different regimens of chemotherapy in advanced epithelal opsoric tumors. All patients received single-ageneous paclitachel as frontline therapy; however, this regimen failed to significantly improve survival in these patients. Furthermore, it was found that there was little difference in the overall survival of patients receiving one of the two regimen options. Another study was conducted to determine whether second-look surgery could be used to treat patients without secondary cyreductive surgery. It was concluded that such surgery was superior to conventional treatments for early-stage ploidy because they required less pain and discomfort. Although many patients experienced rescorts by laparoscopic surgery, only one patient underwent another type of surgery at the time of this study."
18843651,"The aim of this study is to compare the effects of different antihyptertensive drugs regimens on blood pressure in subjects with mild to moderate essential-hypertension. After four weeks of treatment, all patients have similar reductions from sitting standolic and deep-seated bloodpressures which are significantly greater than that observed in placebo treated patients. In addition, dry cough has been reported as a side-effect of certain antihysteria agents. Two studies investigate the efficaciousness of angiostensin-converting enzyme inhibitor moexispril in postmenophausal women who have relapsed into hypertension after conventional therapy. These studies include two hundred and eleven uncomplicate hypertensesive patients who were randied doubleblind to treat either captopriml 50mg or hydrochophothiazides 25mc/HCTZ-25mb. Blood pressure decreases in all groups; but the mean percent change from base was highly significant at eight weeks. Aims To assess the affect of tR and oLapriL 2 mg once per daily, 3 times daily, and indomestacin 25 milliliters three times weekly on renal function: and renal functional reserves in hypertentsives. This study uses standardized doses of both quinpil and verapamek to evaluate the effect of these two drugs on diastoplicblood pressure. Perindopsin erbumini demonstrates superiority to capToprisol when compared to those of select beta blockade for atenolal and calcium Channel blockane with verapomil in 16 patients with moderate essential hyper tension. Both perindopurl plus capTOpriliz reduce blood flow by increasing the resistance of the pressor responder during sustained exercise. Quinpilial also reduces blood vessel resistance because it increases the vasochotic response to repeated exercises. Another study examines the effectiveness of penicillin and felopidine together with an antigtension-converting enzyme inhibiter ramipral. It shows that although they do not alter blood sugar or plasma potassium, they induce variations between blood glucose and plasma potency. Finally, another study determines whether an anidazoline type 1 receptor agonist Moxonidine can be used as an effective hypotensie agent. He concludes that mox"
28093732,"This paper describes the effects of continuous combination hormone therapy on postmenopalasal women. It is a double blinded, placebo controlled trial in 16 608 women aged 50-79 years who received daily conjugated Equine Estrogen or placebo. The results are as follows: increased risk of heart disease and stroke; reduction in mammography scores; improvement in brain function after four months of treatment; and no significant change in breast cancer. In addition, the Women's health Initiative, an organization that promotes healthy lifestyles for women from age 50 to 80, has developed several studies designed to assess the benefits and drawbacks of different forms of menoparal hormonal therapy. These include estrogen alone, which reduces the risks of coronary chest disease but does not increase the overall risk among women with pre-existing conditions. Finally, it is concluded that long-term use of coriolanin may lead to changes in memory functions in older women because it increases the risk associated with elevated blood pressure."
10789614,"In this study, the effects of colloidal bimuth subcipitrate on symptoms and histology are compared in patients with food-related upper abdominal pain. The results indicate that there is no difference in terms of relief from gastric inflammation when comparing the two groups. For example, those who take collidial bismuthum subcitration use less antaicis than they do when taking placebo. Helicobacter Pyloris is a disease that colonizes the mucousa and cause permanent gastri inflammation. Aim: To assess the symptoms caused by Helicobacter Pylori as an adult unseen population. Thirty-three subjects were assigned to one of three regimens; 28 days were spent on combined therapy or one group of eight patients each. Forty nine patients had their symptoms measured before and after completion of treatment. After four weeks, it was found that only those with ""eradication"" did not have more severe symptoms. This study investigates whether hydrogenptox subsalice can be used to treat nonulcer Dyspeppsia. It was concluded that infection with Hippolyta may increase the risk for development of duo denal and Gastric ulcer disease. However, these studies suggest that such conditions may just reflect frequent cooccurrence of Duodenal Ulcer Disease with antral Gastritis. These studies conclude that Huiphosteas has been shown unproven because the organism does not yet produce the disease itself. Non-culcer dyspepsy is common in which no systemic illness ororganic tract disease can identify. Eighties-two subjects treated with NUD received either bismunih Subcitchrate or metronidrazle at varying doses for 1 month. Histologically confirmable gastrites were cleared from 15 patient's cases. Campyllocbacter pYlorI is associated with the pathophysiological role of non-ulate dysplepsivea."" There was recurrent gastering in both groups but no significant improvement was seen in the severity of the condition."
17720798,"Forty-three active men with shoulder pain are enrolled in this study. They undergo three different tests to determine the extent of their superior labral posterior lesions. The first test is the repressed supination outside rotation test, which is used to diagnose superior laboratoryral lessions. This new test has been especially developed for patients with acute shoulder instability. Although many studies have examined the validity of such tests, few have reported that they can be used as an aid in the determination of anterior shoulder injuries. In this paper, we describe the results of a forced abduction and arm flexion test performed on fifty-nine throwing athletes. We also describe how the test was found to be sensitive and specific enough to predict full-thinness tears."
26104189,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of ""sensible-time feedback"" from a wearable activity monitor to improve weight loss in overweight adults. This study uses an eight-week trial to determine whether e-mailed counseling or self-monitory behavior changes are associated with improved health. The results of the first two studies suggest that using technology-based approaches may be more effective than physical activity intervention alone. Anderson concludes by stating that there is little evidence for the effectiveness of these methods in improving overall health and well being."
18751709,"This study consists of two parts: 1) a controlled trial in which patients receive either 2 weeks of talasso therapy, 2) an active treatment with exercise and groupeducation, or 2) supervised exercise. The results are that fifty-eight people receive significant improvement on the health-related satisfaction scales. In addition, fifty eight patients report significant improvements on pain intensity, tender point scores, and quality of life. A second phase of this study is designed to determine the frequency and severity of symptoms among patients with facialgia. It is found that there is no evidence of any disease at all. However, it is suggested that connective tissue therapy may be useful for treating fibromyalsciaria because it has remarkably similar effects on both physical and mental health."
25806470,"In this study, we examine the use of amiodraone in patients with newonset atrial fibrillation. We assess the impact of women's gender on quality of life and stroke risk. Women are older than men, have hypertension, and have prior stroke or severe embolic incidents. The relative risk for stroke is relatively high among women who have atrium fibrillation; however, warfarin has some drawbacks: it can lead to serious bleeding. A recent study suggests that women may be at greater risk of stroke than males because of their longer history of attrition. This study furthermore investigates the effect of sexuality on heart rate during paroxysmal subventricular tatchycardia. It was found that females had more frequent episodes of these events than either men or women."
19748548,"The aim of these studies is to determine the caries preventive effect of a lightpolymerizing composite resin sealer over time and compare the performance of this material with an art-restorative treatment. Forty six boys and 59 girls were divided into two groups in brisk treatment designs. A light polymerized composite Resealant material was placed in 180 first morals, while another high-visosity glass Ionomer was used. After five years, both materials failed to perform as expected. In contrast, four conventional glass-imocol cements developed specifically for use with restorative treatments performed by trained examiners showed superior results. Thirt thirty sound permanent mm and half-mild division into five groups were rended into eight groups. Each group had ten teeth; each tooth was cut into multiple beam shapes using different types of filling material. These experiments revealed that the same Type IIIR or Type IVR material may be suitable as either type of sealant or as part of one of the three kinds described above."
29406457,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the ROM after total kneearthroplasty in healthy asymptomatious, Asian-Indian and Korean adults between twenty and forty years of age. In this paper, we describe the results of an eight-year-old patient who had undergone Oxford's phase III unicomparmental knee replacement. At the end of the study, the mean height of varus was 174.9 o'clock with 34.6 % of his limbs being in inherentvarus. We also present the peak outcomes of four Oxford-managed knee repairs performed through confined incisions. Aim approved by the food and drug administration in 2004, the Oxford Medial partial knee is used for anteromdial Ostearthritis in patients without an intact anteriorcruciate ligament. This new approach has not yet received wide acceptance in the United states."
29681480,"In this paper, the results of a large number of patients who have been treated with endoscopes are compared to those obtained after only one year. The outcome of these studies is similar to that of other prospective studies. For example, in this study, we assess the influence of different predictors for healing following periapid surgery. We also examine the effect of various predictators on the healing outcome during two-year follow up. After 30 teeth were treated by an endoscopic device, 91.1 percent and 90.7 percent of them were classed as successful. Apical surgery has been controversial because of its long-term prognositic effects. However, recent evidence suggests that it may be possible to predict the long term success of such procedures. This study compares root-end material using retroplast or mineral trioxice aggregate as root filling material. It was found that there was no difference in the success rate between the two groups. Furthermore, several teeth had failed due to root fracture. These failures were classified as failings according to the severity of the disease. Another study uses cone beam technology to evaluate the efficacy over time of surgical intervention. Two hundred teeth received either Retroplast/MTA or SuperEBA at the same time. Both treatments showed significant improvement in both patient outcomes."
25076495,"The Nurses' Health Study is a large, well-respected study of people with type 2 or mild-to-diabetic disease. In this paper, we aim to investigate the relationship between walnut consumption and incident Type 2 diabetes in two large cohort studies. We follow 58,0663 women aged 53-77 years in the National Heartland Education program and 78,893 woman aged 35-52 years without any risk of heart disease or cancer at base. Nuts seem to have some beneficial effects on blood glycerics but are not shown to be effective in treating patients with Type 1 or Type 2. Aiming to assess the effect of an almond-enriched eating pattern on insulinsensitivity and fats in patients who have normoglycian or type 2, we compare four diets: 1) high-fat, high almond, 2) low-favorable, 3) moderate-fatty, and/or no fat. After each four-wk diet, body weight, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose level, as well as other measures of health were measured. These results suggest that nuts may be useful for improving both endotility and cardiovascular function in subjects with either type 1, especially those with severe hypertension."
28785411,"This study focuses on the assessment of overreach in elite triathlons. Sixteen male triathleters were assigned into two groups, one group completed six weeks of normal exercise and the other was deliberately overexhausted through intense training. Both groups completed the same seven day stepwise training reduction taper. The objective of this study is to verify if elite junior baseball players have a minimum 1 month performance decrease accompanied by mood profiles and stress levels typical of ""non-functional overaching"". A case-control approach is used to detect changes in behavior after completing an extended endurance test at 10 % greater intensity than the individual anobic threshold. Over ninety young elite tennis players were followed during the 2006-2008 seasons ; 17 male endurance sportsmen aged 23.4 years old and VO2 max : 61.2 plus /-1.7 ml x min1-1 X kg1=means+/SEM During the present prospect I ve longitudinal studies was to investigate how hormonal response in undertrained athletics at rest and while exercise consisted of short-term exhaustion tests on cycle ergoometer at an intensified intensity 10 percent above the individuals anaerotic threshold."" Field performance tests are used for decrement of performance throughout equating fatigue severity with resting blood concentrations as well as physical activity. In addition, the aim of the study has been to examine whether the acute hormonal responses to abominable bouts of vigorous exercise can be correlated with performance in Cyclopes's team."
22387009,"In this study, we examine the effect of physical training on blood pressure and endotolity in obese children. We compared exercise with no exercise for eighty-two pre-primertal patients who were assigned to either an exercise group or not. The results showed that both groups gained significant improvements in their height and body mass index. This study is important because it will allow us to compare the effects of exercise on various risk factors such as lipoproteins, leptenin, and other body weight. Our aim is to determine whether exercise training will improve the function of the atheroscian disease in young children"
10796152,"In this paper, the effects of reduced maternal concentrations of idine on fetal health are investigated. A double blind trial in five village inPapua new Guinea showed no significant changes in motor and intellectual function at age 11 or 15, compared to children who had received either rebuffing or placebo treatment. Endemic prehension is characterized by multiple neuro defects, including diplegia, squitt, and mental disease. The condition occurs widely in New Guinea in relation to severe odamine deficiencies. Pregnant women were divided into three groups: group A was treated with 100 mg/day; group B was not treated until 3 months before pregnancy; and group C was given during the first-month of pregnancy. After birth, all newborns were full term without goitre."
26897342,"This paper focuses on the effects of an intervention designed to reduce screen time, increase fruit and vegetables consumption, and improve physical activity on children in grades 6 to 8 who are at risk for obesity. It also examines the effect of this intervention on weight status among African American girls. The study concludes by comparing the results of the intervention with those of other control groups. In addition, it shows that there is a significant association between watching and eating too much; however, no studies have examined the effectiveness of such strategies."
21438991,"Eighty-Seven Morbidly Obesive patients prospectively ively ""randomized"" to two gastric bypass procedures. Gastric passes out more quickly than the other two, and there are no complications in either group. A recent clinical trial of gastroplasty for morbid weight loss has been performed at North Carolina Hospital. The results indicate that gastri bypass is superior to the current version with a smaller pouch. However, this does not mean that it is as effective as the previous version. In contrast, laparoscopic adjustment gastic b and eating was previously used for treating moribid obesity. This study compares the effects of both methods on body weight, appetite, fasting, postpr, blood loss, length of stay, mortality, early and Late Reoperation rate, weight Loss, changes in Quality of Life, Cost. Although many studies have reported that weight reduction improves cardiovascular risks, none have investigated whether weight gain reduces overall mortality."
26882490,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates that percutaneous electrodestimulation can induce erectility in patients with complete or partial spinal cord injury. He uses a novel device called sildenanafil to demonstrate its efficacy in treating patients who have relapsed into idiligence after aneurysm. The results suggest that silldenasol may be more effective than other anti-ecstatic drugs in the treatmentof obstructive lumbar nerve disease."
20012073,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective study on weight bearing after total hip surgery. After 43 consecutive patients with osteoarthrotic hips received an uncemented and hydroxyatite-coating prosthesis between February 1996 to February 2000. All were performed in sterile way by three surgeons. They were randized to partial or full weightbealing for the first six weeks after surgery followed by self-training. The mean subsidence of stem was 0.05 mm at 1 week and no significant difference was found between the two groups. Aims To investigate the effect of late- phase exercise program on patients who undergo elective hip/knee replacement. This study is designed to determine whether high-risk individuals would benefit more from early post-surgery inpatient rehabilitation than those who are not fit to return home immediately after their surgery because of the risk of complications."
30088015,"In this paper, Wu et al present the results of a large-scale study on Japanese patients with atrium fibrillation. They conclude that aspirin is safe and efficacious in treating these patients. The aim of this study is to determine whether three lead-monitoring methods can be used to detect atrial fibrilation in general practices. It is shown that two approaches are most cost effective: 1) rate control and 2) rate-controlled drugs. Both approaches have significant drawbacks; however, they do reduce the risk of stroke and death."
32216045,"The effects of water and sweeteners on body weight are compared among 304 overweight and obesity-adolescents. Both treatments show greater weight loss than the other, with drinking water having a significant effect on losing weight. In this study, 40-one obese women were assigned to consume either sucrose or aspartume over four weeks in brisk single-blinded fashion. They were divided into two groups: one group consumed suc rose drinks or another group received artificiallysweetened drinks. After an 18 month trial, 641 normal-weighed children were randomly assigned from 4 years old to receive 250ml per day of sugar-free or ""artificially sweetened"" beverages. This study investigates whether replacing these beverages with water would improve weight gain during relapses after completing hypenergetic weight reduction. Women in each group lost approximately 10 percent of initial body fat during active weight Loss was positively reflected by as partame consumption. However, it was not known whether that difference was sustained during subsequent 12 month weight maintenance period. Thus, we investigated whether replacement of soft drinks for water could improve long-term weight control. We examined the effects upon body mass and glycemic changes in overweight subjects who had been given low-caloric foods. A pilot study was performed to determine the effect of substituting synthetically sweeter beverages on blood pressure change. It was found that substituted alcohol did not significantly increase blood concentrations but reduced them considerably."
29189928,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of physical activity on weight gain and body mass index in young adults who have been overweight or obese for at least 16 years. The results indicate that almost 60 % of these women remain in the healthy category from 1996 until now. Although there is much evidence that physical exercise can be beneficial for weight loss, little is known about how to reduce sitting time in younger adults with Type 2 diabetes. This study aims to determine whether a structured education workshop will be effective in reducing sitting behavior in older adults at riskof Type 2, particularly in those with high waist circumferences."
30369810,"In this study, we examine the strength of self-etched orthodontic braces bonded to two different types of teeth using an in-vivostoon debonding technique. The results show that the shear bonds of the new device are superior to those of conventionally bonding devices at two time intervals. This paper also describes a new method for testing the influence of precoating and selfetching primer on tooth bond strength. It is based on three methods: 1) split-mouth bidding; 2) single-way bidded; and 3) double-sided bibanding. A pilot version of these methods was first developed and validated by three experienced reviewsers. Two raters were used to assess face and content validity as well as external validity. After bondment, all sample samples were stored in water at room temp for 24 hours. Brackt de Bonding strength related with diverse debinding methods and Enamel damage has not yet been assessed in victorious vivo."
24217903,"The effects of lower dose growth hormone on cardiovascular function in adults with hypopitarism are described. In adulthood, GH replacement has been shown to improve body composition and risk factors; however, studies have not yet examined the effect of longer-term growth therapy on these same concerns. This study is a follow-up trial of thirty patients with adultonset gh deficiencies who were initially treated with placebo. After six months, they were compared with controls for height, body weight, lean mass, and waist-hip ratio. They also showed significant differences in IGF-binding protein-3 levels. Adult onset Ghd disease is associated with abnormalities of blood lipoproteins and glucosal content. Preliminate evidence has suggested that this may be an additive to statin therapy. However, several studies report premature mortality in those with acute coronaries. A case-control population was followed from January 1992 to January 2000. Thirteen patients received recombineant human growthhormone replacement therapy tittered to clinical response. Short term growth Hormone treatment had beneficial effects on fat composition, insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, as well as changes in other markers of inflammation. Long-lived growth regimens have been used to treat hypertension, but there is still debate about whether or not it can be effective. One study suggests that long-life growth maintenance might reduce the risk of heart attack. Another study reports that elevated levels of pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A appear to predict early atheroscomatosis. It is reported that pregnant women with severe adultogenital diseases often have increased fasting glucose. These studies suggest that increasing growth factor concentrations may lead to premature atherolysis."
29399794,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft demonstrates that the risk of bias in a controlled trial can be reduced by using an instrument to track the changes in bone mineral content over time. The mean bone mass value for epileptics is 87 p.m. and during treatment with 3,000 international unit of vitamin D2, an average bone malacity increase of 4 percent was found whereas the mean values for placebo group and control groups were unchanged. Acute hip fracture patients are not well-recognized because they have not yet been properly supervised. Metamorphisms We enrolled seventeen patients who had severe hip injuries and were treated with extended physio therapy, stand and ard treatments, single blinded treatment, and 800 IU per day. This study was designed to evaluate bone health status in patients on convulsant drug therapy. It was aimed at determining whether use of bisphosphonates could prevent loss of body mass as compared to other anticonvulsion drugs. Ad-Sos values were significantly low in all patients, but directly associated with basal 25-OH-3 levels. Purpose To investigate whether long-term useof briskly dissolved calcium and/or Vitamin D may prevent new morphological vertebral or nonvertebrol fractures in men taking antiecileptic drugs such as penicillin, napthalate, or carbazolepine. All entrusted participants received either calcium or vitaminD supplementation."
25409296,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the relationship between physical activity intensity and body fat in overweight youth. He uses a cross sectional study to examine the association between moderate and vigorous exercise intensity with changes in body mass and fat at different age levels. Anderson concludes by stating that ""physical activity"" is an important intervention for weight management because it can help prevent overeating and improve health. However, studies have not yet examined the effects of intense physical activities on body composition."
28228371,"In this study, we examine the safety and efficacy of supervised dance-based exercises in patients with stable heart failure. We compare the effect of dancing to formal exercise training for improving functional capacity in subjects with chronic heart failing. The results suggest that dancing may be an effective treatment for patients who have a high level of risk for developing Type II or Type III disease."
28340030,"A study is presented to determine whether an ""impairment-based mentoring"" program can improve the control of Type 1 diabetes in patients with severe, chronic disease. The results show that telemedicine has been used as a means of improving blood glucose control in type1 patients and that there is no significant difference between the two groups after six months. In this paper, we describe the effect of Sweet Talk on self-management by using text messages from the sweettalk system. We conclude that it is possible to use technology such as cell phones and the web to improve patient health. This paper also discusses the use of telephone technology for improved blood sugar control. It describes ten patients who were assigned to receive regular care or receive Web-Based Care management; they received either one group or the other group. After 6 month, the mean change in haemogen A1c was reduced from 7.7 %) to 6.92 % p..001 compared with conventional care. Another paper reports that physicians are now more likely to prescribe long-term regimens of insulin than usual care because of the increased frequency of visits."
15846630,"This study focuses on the effect of open and subcutive surgical techniques on patients with chronic internal fissure. In this paper, we compare the changes in anal Canal pressure after either technique of sphlorotomy as well as the results of both methods in twenty-eight patients who have been treated with these two different approaches. The mean value for operative times were 6.6min for group A; 9.1 minfor group B. Purpose: ""It is believed that closed or open sided stern apologies may lead to improved incontinency rates after open or closed wards. Although there are many other treatments available for treatment of acute analsis, it remains difficult to determine whether they can be used alone or together. We examine the extent of dissection by the open approach and then compare how long it takes to heal. There is no difference in pain at any time during the procedure. Both methods result in significant improvement in patient satisfaction."
28060187,"In this paper, we describe the results of a double blinded trial of statins in patients with heart disease. The outcome is that they reduce their risk of dying from any cause or major complications. After four years, most patients receive open label lipid-reducing treatment. This study extends follow-up studies to investigate the safety and efficacy of propravastain in older people. We conclude that it is not possible to predict whether long-term benefit will be seen in elderly people because of increased risk for stroke and other serious events. Although there is no concluding evidence for the benefits of antihystertensive drugs in these groups, several trials have been performed. One of the most promising is the ""Hyvet"" trial, which was designed to evaluate the effects of blood pressure reduction on mortality and Morbidity among elderly men and women who are at high risk but do not have underlying vascular diseases. These trials were followed for six years after completion."
20459784,"In this study, we examine the effects that physical training intensity has on body composition and bone mineral content in overweight children. We compare changes in geometry and strength of proxial femural bones between prepubertal boys who participate in a high impact circuit intervention for 20 months with 33 maturity-matched controls. The primary objective is to compare change in total body, lumbbar spine, and resemblance to other European children's health risk factors. This cross sectional study was designed to assess the association between exercise training and clustering cardiovascular disease risk in children from three European nations. Children were selected according to their height, age, gender, blood pressure, weight, etc. Adipokines were associated with increased perceived physical conditioning, body satisfaction, overall physical selfworth, but no differences were found between groups over the 8-week period. Our aim was to determine whether diet or exercise could change the clinical profiles of Syndrome x in young children: hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipoproteinemia; hypertension ; and coronary heart disease comprise ""Systoic Blood Pressure,"" which is first described in adulthood. Although there are few studies examining the effect of physical activity on these conditions, several have been published. For example, an eight-month program of jumping exercises improves bone mass in pre-primertal girls by improving both her bone structure and her fat mass."
31067200,"In this study, we examine the effects of autonomy blockade and Renal sympathetic Denervation on blood pressure in patients with essential-hypertension. We compared the effect of Autonomic Blockades on arterial stiffness and Aortic Distensibility as predictors of response to treatment. This study is a follow-up study of 5238 patients who had type 2 diabetes for 4 years. The results suggest that lifestyle intervention can reduce the risk of major strokes and heart failure in Type 2 patients."
28380067,"In this paper, Wu demonstrates the efficacy and safety of a hypnotic exercise program for patients suffering from multiple sclerosis. It is shown that it can be used to treat fatigue, mood, and sleep problems in breast cancer patients. This study compares the effects of an eight-week self-recorded meditation program with one that uses nonsense words to control symptoms. The results indicate that the program does not have any side effects on fatigue or depression. A prospective, open-label, random-experimentation study is conducted to determine whether ""t'ay chi"" can effectively treat chronic fatigue in patients who have weakened their health due to heart failure."
20459783,"In this paper, the authors examine the association of walking, leisure time activity, and risk for hip fracture among older women. They use a population-based casecontrol study to determine whether physical activity is related to stroke risk in communitydwelling people aged 65 or older. The results suggest that exercise may reduce the risk from all causes but that it does not seem to be possible to predict death with high levels of vigorous activity. Women who do not increase their daily physical activities have lower risk of developing breastcancer than those who are more physically active. This paper also discusses the relationship between moderate and vigorous exercises and the risks of heart disease. It concludes by examining the effect of regular physical movement on the reduction of both blood pressure and mortality in elderly people."
29478682,"In this paper, we describe the results of a novel endodontic patient-centered study. Forty eight patients agree to participate in it. The aim of the study is to describe and compare ""quality of life"" of patients treated with restored teeth versus those who have an implant- supported prosthesis. We conclude that there are no reliable methods for predicting the outcome of root canal treatment. Aim To investigate the probabilities of and factors influenceing periapracia status of teeth Following primary or secondary root Canal treatment; Methods This prospect involves annual clinical andradigraphic follow- up of 1 o'clock roots, 792 teeth and 554 patients. Pre-, Intra- and post-operative data was collected prospectively on custom forms. Prognostic factored within patients were adjust in all models without error. InTRODUCATION This study seeks to present how biofilms can be used to remove debris from extracted teeth using NiTi instrumentation. It uses two different techniques: 1) Hybrid rotary technique which uses Niti instruments and 2) manual stepback technique using stainless steel files. These treatments reduce the number of bacteria in the root system. Furthermore, all three methods significantly reduce infection."
28182680,"In this study, we examine the effects of an infant behavioural assessment and intervention program on preterm and term infants. Preterm children have better sensory response than term children in terms of their motor skills. This study also focuses on the relationship between sensory responsiveness and temperament and furthermore investigates the effect of early experiences on brain development. We conclude that early experience may be associated with adverse neurodebracies in prematurely ill infant girls."
30948819,"In this study, we examine the influence of blood pressure and pulse wave on the risk of stroke in 30 untreated patients. We compared the effects of amlopidine 5mg, doxyazosin 4, lisinateopril 10, bristoltel 5 mg, bendroflazide 2.5m or placebo on blood flow and heart rate. The best treatment was repeated at end of the cycle. Bisoproplalol, an alpha1 blocker, was studied for its antihypertinesive effect in mild to moderately hypertensively patients with mild-to-mode hypertension. A doubleblind, Latin- square, crossover design was used to compare the efficacy of bisoPrololil against placebo in thirty-four newly-diagnosed patients who were divided into four groups: double blinded; crossover; placebo controlled. Blood pressure measurements were performed at every visit. At each visit,blood pressure was measured. After six weeks of treatment, patient's blood concentration was tracked. Each group received one of three different drugs: amlorodipine 5, doxazon 6, hysteriazides 6mG, bistrol 8mM/H 6.25m M., bostroflua Zide 2mL. This study evaluates the safety of using chlorothiazde as a diuretic when given twice daily with 5 milligrams of B5/HCTZ."
17253466,"This paper focuses on the impact of anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorders on quality of lives. The authors present a study that compares two treatment approaches for anxiety: cognitive behavior therapy and applied relaxation. In this paper, Butler and Anstasiadas describe three reliable predictators of response to anxiety management in patients with Generalized anxious disorder. A pilot study is presented which uses standardized patient-specified measures as predictors against outcome when using multiple variables. It concludes that CBT-Gad/PC is superior to usual care in older adults with panic disorder because it has been demonstrated to be more effective than other forms of psychological treatment. There are six randoes of controlled trials of mental therapy with generalised anxieties disorder; all have used the Spielberger state-trait anxiety inventory as one of many outcome measures"
25109883,"This paper focuses on the effects of walking training with restricted blood flow on muscle mass and strength gain in elderly people. It uses a population-based survey to estimate the prevalence of scaropenia, an inherited disease associated with metabolic, physiological, and functional declines. The results suggest that exercise is beneficial for older people because it improves both physical and mental health. In addition, it reduces the risk of falls by reducing the burden of fatigue."
28787537,"The aim of this study is to determine whether the strict treatment of blood pressure 140mmHg is beneficial in elderly patients who are older than 70. We divided three260 patients aged70-84 years into two groups, either strict or moderately treated. A composite outcome was evaluated for 2 years. This study evaluates the impact of Renal Function on cardiovascular outcomes among elderly hypertensesive patients. In this prospective study, we divided 3260 adults aged 70 to 80 years with isolated sickle hypertension and assigned them either a strictly controlled treatment group or milder control group. After evaluating the effect of renal function upon heart failure in these patients, they were divided into four groups according to their severity of disease. They were then divided as follows: 1 patient with bp less than 160 mmhg or higher; 2 patients with more than 180 mh G; and 3 patients without any other risk factors. These patients were followed for two years by an end point of stroke or death. Although there is no concluding evidence that such treatment can reduce the risk from stroke, it is clear that antihypersive therapy may be useful in some cases."
26198702,"In this study, we examine the effect of Lactobacterus reuri on the composition of breastmilk in relation to sensitiveness and apprehension in infants. We conclude that probiotic treatment may reduce the frequency of ecrozema but that it is still not well established whether or not it can prevent such an occurrence."
25984731,"Prognostics are used to predict future events and the value of new treatments in patients. In this paper, we examine the relationship between complications and anti-platelets before and after a nerve intervention. The aim is to determine the extent of resistance among patients with acute heart disease who receive aspirin. We study the effect of increasing frequency of drug treatment on platelet function. A patient with Type 2 Diabetes mellitate has reduced aspidin-induced blood pharmacodynamo effects. This may lead to an increased ratio of non-aspipin-inhibiated platelets during daily dose interval. Furthermore, there is evidence that asperin resistance is related to adverse cardiovascular events. These include stroke, myomyocardialty infacrator ion, hospitalization due to re Vascular Cleopatra's disease, and death. Although these studies have not yet been published, they provide important information about the association between risk factors for sudden thromboic events or long-term safety."
17312231,"Epidural anesia has been used to treat patients with ischemia. In this paper, we describe the effect of epidal analgesis on blood flow and inflammation in patients who undergo radical eophagectomy. We compare the effects of different types of post-surgery anesthesia on patient outcome. For example, patients receive more pain relief after surgery than they do after open surgery. This study is designed to determine whether or not there are any differences between the severity of injury and the length of follow-up care for patients receiving both type of anaesthesia."
26561616,"In a crossover feeding trial, subjects were divided into three different diets. The first was an all-in-one diet with coconuts as the main source of energy; the second was enriched with nuts. After four weeks, they were assigned to one of three groups: 1) A control diet without nuts; 2) A Mediterranean-type diet; and 3) A low-fat controlled diet. Both groups lost their weight during the study but both had significant reductions in total and lipophosphorylated cholesterol. This study also examined the effects of pecan consumption on blood pressure and other markers of cardiovascular disease. It was concluded that eating nuts reduces risk of heart disease by reducing levels of fat in the body. Furthermore, this study showed that frequent nuts can lower blood lipid concentrations significantly."
30599499,"In this study, we examine the effects of intradetrustor and sub-urothelially onabotuliinumtixin A on patients with spinal Cord injury who have neurogenic de Trusor overactiveness. We conclude that a single arm clinical trial will be performed to investigate the efficaciousness of Bonton-A for treating nervergic detruso overactivity in spine-cord injured patients."
30616454,"In this study, we compare the biomechanical characteristics of the hip resemblance between conventional total hip surgery and surface replacement technique. The results are similar in both groups. A new straight hip stem is used for primary total-hip arthrostry. Both methods improve the leg length and reduce the risk of complications. This study uses an imageless navigation system to determine the degree of improvement in the cup position and the relative ease with which the patient can move. We report that the patients who receive the navigated or conventional approach have better pain scores than those treated with the conventional method."
30177287,"In this paper, we report the efficaciousness and safety of interferociation for the treatmentof Peyrisone's disease. We compared the results of two different regimens of treatment: 1) placebo-controlled intervention; and 2) an open-label, parallel study. The primary endpoint was to assess the effect of subcutaneously injected IFN Alpha-2b on penile deformity. This trial was performed in a blinded, multi-centre, placebo controlled fashion. It was aimed at evaluating the effects of both experimental and observational approaches on patients with peyronie diseases."
26416579,"In this paper, we examine the relationship between high-denity lipophosphoprotein cholesterol and risk of heart disease in men and women. We find that a one-mg/Dl increase in high density Lipoprotein is associated with reversal of risk for coronary heart diseases in middle-aged men. The association between elevated lipodyphosphorylation and increased atherosis risk is not yet established. This study investigates the effect of anthonins on paraonoxonasen1 activity in patients who have Type 2 diabetes. It is shown that antagonizing agents such as iron and simvastain are associated by reducing the activity of Pon1 in type 2diaries. Aiming to investigate the influence of polymorphismatic changes in PON1, we examined the effects of two different genotypes: 1) methionines; 2) arginium for glutamine. These were previously reported to be associated With coronarry disease."
24794372,"A comparison of growth responses of preubertal children who received either daily or three times a week with human growth-threats over four years was made. The results were as follows: annual growth velocity increased significantly in the ""QD"" group, while the other two groups showed no change in height during each of the four yr's time. In this study, we assess the effect of combined growth and GH treatment on adult height for patients with short statures. We conclude that it is not possible to predict the final height of these patients because of their small size. However, several studies have shown rapid effects of both treatments on height. Short-term trials have demonstrated an increase in length after administration of growthogen; however, there are few controlled trials remaining until final tallness. This study compares long-lasting effects upon height in infants with shorter stature. It has been reported that recombineant humangrowth hormone can be used to treat such children. There are still debates about its efficacy among physicians and patients alike."
24808490,"A study is made of the effects of low or high-sugar consumption on blood levels ofcholesterol, phospholipoproteins, and glycerides. The men are divided into four groups each of which contains a different type of food. Twelve men with hyperinsulinemial responses to sucrose load are given diets that contain 0 ; 7.5 ) and 15 %) fructosate for 5 hk each in crossover design. In the men who have normal insulin responses, the foods contain 43 % carbohydrate, 42 p.m. fat, 16 pp. free fatty acids, 6 wk. Fifteen men were assigned to either group because they had abnormally high fasting lipopeptide concentrations or because their body mass was greater after the consume of fructicse than cornstarch. They were then divided according to whether they reduced fat or sugar. Both groups received no advice. Their weight loss was not observed. This study examined the effect of two different types of sweetened soft drinks on changes in body composition. Type 1 patients were instructed to reduce fat while Type 2 patients required higher amounts of refined carbohydrates. These subjects were further studied in this study. It was found that there was no significant differences between the results of these two studies in either Type1 or Type2 patients. However, it was revealed that both diet regimens produced better health outcomes. People should be advised to cut back on excessive fat and replace starchy foods with more fiberful sources of carbohydrates to avoid heart disease."
18029834,"The aim of this study is to determine whether walking 10000 steps a day would improve blood pressure, insulinsensitivity, and heart function in patients with Type 2 diabetes. After six weeks of walking, the control group receives no change in their activity. In contrast, fifteen women in the active group walk more than their daily lifestyle. This study examines the effect of an exercise regimen on physical activity for older adults with Ostearthritis. A home-based program with Pedometer-Driven Walking results in improvements in muscle strength, health-regarding quality of life, depression, self-effigacy, as well as changes in body composition and risk factors."
21339335,"In this study, we examine the effects of growth-hormone replacement therapy on memory and strength in elderly people with GHdeficiency. We find that the initial dose of gh replacement is not sufficient to restore normal blood flow in older patients. However, after 12 weeks, the mean maintenance dose is reduced to 0.3mg/day."
24384894,"This paper focuses on the use of an elderly population-based survey to estimate the frequency of sarcopenia in New Mexico. The results from this study are compared with those obtained from a prospective cohort of patients with lung cancer. A mean body mass Index was calculated for each patient and then used as predictor of muscle mass in these patients. In addition, it was used to assess the function of other measures such as the Karnifsky, Brief fatigue Inventory, and the Edmonton symptoms assessment scale. These results showed that there was no agreement among physicians regarding the performance of 100 consecutive patients who had been treated with breastcancer."
23419910,"This paper focuses on the effect of an eight-week resistance exercise program on strength, balance, and function in patients with parkinsonic disease. It is a mixed-effects study that consists of two controlled trials and one uncontrolled trial. The first trial was designed to assess the reliability of the Berg balance scale, the second to determine whether changes in balance are detectable after adjustment for change due to laboratory error, while the third test was used to measure falls risk in people with Parkinsonism. In this study, thirty-seven adults withparkinsonic disease were matched against control groups. Fortyeight participants had fall or were at high risk of falling during the six-month intervention period. Thirty seven community-dweling adults who had fallen either under or out of their control were divided into two groups: exercises or controls. Eighteen subjects with mildly to moderate Parkinson's disease received three times weekly exercise classes and exercised home three time weekly. A primary outcome measure measured PD falls risks score. Both groups showed lower leg muscle strength than controls; however, they did not show any improvement in ankle strength."
30225547,"Premature Emjaculation: A prospective, doubleblind, parallel-controlled study of sertriline in prematurely ejacuation. In this single-blindend cross-over trial, patients were divided equally into 5 groups and treated with different drugs. The primary objective was to compare efficacy for the ondem and useof paroxentine, dapxetine or sildenanafil combined dapaxerine with silldenaf citrate in treatment of men with premature embculations. This study included 60 patients who had severe premature escapades. They were assigned two groups: one group received tramadyl 50mg on dem and the other group got parodytine 20mb daily. After 6 weeks, the patients' satisfaction scores were measured and they were compared before and after an 8 week treatment period. Paradoxical effect of fluoxetine has been reported; however, these studies ignore female factors and can not exclude the probabilities of drug interaction. Dapoxitine is now being developed for treating premature Ejakulation as well."

31415611,"In this paper, we focus on the role of fatty acid stereospecificity in metabolic processing. We examine the association between sacrificial fats and Type 2 diabetes in a cross-over study with European participants from the Episcopic-Interact case-colhort study. This study includes 1240 people with incident Type 2, 16 154 European individuals with 399 million person years of follow up. The results of the study are described in this chapter. A conflicting evidence exists about the relationship between saturated acylcholic acids and type 2 disease. These studies were performed by two authors independently. One was included in an earlier study to investigate the effect of coconut oil on blood phospholipid levels. Another was used to assess the effects of palmolein on plasma lipoprotein profiles in Chinese subjects."
30700025,"In this paper, we examine the association between blood levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin-D and all cause mortality in older adult men. We conclude that low levels may be more likely to predict death than high levels. This paper also discusses the relationship between serum 25 H d and risk of heart disease. It is reported that people with higher levels are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease because they have poorer concentrations of 25,H hydrovitain D. The study furthermore investigates whether there is an association among 25-hydroxyvinamin D, 1,-25-dihypvitin C, and parathormone Hormone. A large population of older adults has been collected in Denmark during the period from 1816 to 1999. All deaths were tracked by a cox proportionalhazard regression model. Serum level was measured at time of enrolling in 1998-1999; after follow-up, it was determined that all causes of death were associated with 25OH c/m. Aged over 60 years, subjects were free of any type of disease or injury. After following up for three years as usual, total 263 cases develop cardiovascular death events. As 25H dihydroxyviminated concentration increased, the incidence rate of cardiovascular diseases andall-cause fatality declined progressively. Concurrently, studies reporting on the relation between 25N hidrogenital D and vitamin D had conflicting results. For example, one study found that patients with elevated 25Oh nmolpl concentration did not show significant increases in risk but showed no association with overall mortality. Another study examined the effect of lower 25O holovinic D concentration on all-caluse mortality when compared to those with high 25 O choleculiferol concentration. Although some studies suggest that reduced 25OMPL might lead to better outcomes, other studies report mixed results"
25431132,"This study focuses on the effects of exercise on menopatisal symptoms in women who have recently undergone menstrual surgery. The results suggest that exercise training may be an effective strategy for relieving pain and improving quality of life. Women with vasory symptoms are assigned to either control, passive stretching, or yoga groups. In this group, they receive regular physical exercises and daily health lectures. They also report their hot flushed frequency and bother as measured by daily diary records. A pilot study is conducted in which postmenopalasal women experience moderate to severe cold flashes at least four days a day. After 12 weeks, the severity of these symptoms decreases significantly over time; however, there is no significant difference in the number of patients treated. Another study investigates the effect of strength training on bone mineral densitivity in healthy post-mastectomy women. It is concluded that resistance training improves body mass index but does not lead to improved health."
28686645,"In this study, the effect of daily doses of 1,500 IU of 25-Hydoxyvin D on blood pressure is examined. The results indicate that patients with low 25hhoD levels are at increased risk of developing heart disease. A case-control trial was performed in 18225 men who had been free of cardiovascular disease and were followed for 10 years. This study suggests that there may be an inverse relationship between high-25h HnD concentrations to riskof incident hypertension. Two prospective cohort studies included 6,13 men from Physicians' Follow-Up Seeks and 1198 females from Nurses health Study. After two years, they showed no association between 25OHD level and risk; however, some reported negative or incoclusive associations. These studies suggest that it is possible that vitamin D can reduce the mortality of low birth weight infants in poor income countries. There have been few reports about the effects of regular daily consumption of 500 iu/day of Vitamin D as a preventative measure against death. However, many studies have suggested higher amounts of 25,hydroxyvitamin C, which has been associated by elevated risk factors such as arteriosclerosis and heart failure. Although these studies do not show any positive association, several trials have found significant differences in the severity of symptoms among individuals with lower 25th HhO D levels. Some evidence suggests further improvement in depression when given more than one annual large dose. Other studies report that excessively high levels of25Hh O D lead to reduced risks of fracture and death in older people."
26548872,"This study focuses on bonding strength of two different types of cements, one that is ""yttium-stabilized"" and the other that has no surface treatment. The bonds are stronger than those of any other type of resin cement. In this paper, we compare the bond strength between three different surfaces: airborne particles abraded, tribological silica coat/silanization coupling system, TSC & Rocatec; and al2O3 airburst abrades. Bonding specimens are cut into sticks to be bonded to pre-treated porcelain. After 24 hours, all specimen's were cemented in tension for 60 days. A series of laboratory tests have been performed to determine the effect of various surface treatments on shearbond strength. These include 1) using an Al20Al2-airborne-particulate particle asbrasion, 2) using phosphoric acid monomers, and 3) using polyethylene moulds to form seals. All samples are then subjecteved to heat treating for 180 days before they are ready to bond."
24514899,"This study consists of three cross-sectionals, retrospective studies of 3 sources: Emedical records; Administrative claims data; and National Healthand Nutrition Examination Surveys. The primary aim of the study was to estimate how much high-risk patient treated with statink monotherapy who reached adult treatment panels III - recommended low-disease lipoproteincholesterol goals  100mg/dL as well as not a high density lipodyprotein cholesterol goals"". In patients with stable coronary disease, statins are inadequate in reducing their risk of heart attack. However, it is unknown whether more intense therapy produces extra benefits when compared to less conventional regimens such as adding simvastain to 80 or 10 mg daily. A double-blinde blind trial has been performed in 12064, men and women age 18-80 years with an history of Myocardial Ion ion. Type 2 diabetic subjects were assigned to receive either 80 millimmol/day simpvastatin at 10 or 20 Mg per day or an increase from the rosusustapin dose to 5 Mb/Day. After eight weeks, the percent change in total LDL-DhL-C levels was calculated by electrophortic mobility shift asbite. These results suggest that combination therapy with another statine plus fenorate would reduce the risks of cardiovascular disease for patients older than 65 years. Although many patients do not achieve their target LLD-Hcholestrol levels, especially in extremely high risk patients, this study compares the effect of increasing statitration on endotothelial functions in patients aged over 75 years old with very high blood vessel disease. Many patients have failed to reach their goal but they can be improved by using combination treatments. For example, one group of patients received ezetamibe together with atorvastin while another group received only rocusatin. Both groups had significant reductions in both reduced HDL content and increased C-Reactive Protein concentrations after six weeks of combined treatment."
17988396,"This paper describes a social-marketing campaign to distribute insecticide-treated nets to malaria patients in the area. It is based on cross sectional observation and surveys of pharmacists, drug sellers, and customers. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of government regulation for private pharmacy practice among low- income countries. In particular, it examines the effect of an intervention that involves inspections of pharmacies; information about drugs sold and sanctioned; and reporting of drug purchases. A total of 173 pulmonary tuberculous patients were treated with Ort, which has become the standard treatment for diarrheal disease in developing world. However, there was no evidence of improvement in quality of care provided by the intervention. Furthermore, women from poor areas were more satisfied with sexual and reproductive services than those from lower-class areas."
20524996,"This paper focuses on the effects of sugar-sucrose drinks on appetite and body weight in normal-women. The subjects were divided into two groups, one group was assigned to drink three servings per day while the other group received only one serving. In this study, we examined the effect of drinking sweetened beverages on body composition among postmenopalausal women. We found that drinking APM or high fructose corn Syrup for three wk reduces the calorie consumption of both genders but does not increase the body mass of males. Furthermore, drinking either type of soft drink reduced the amount of fat consumed by both men and women; however, it did not lead to any significant changes in body size."
30302558,"In this paper, we describe the results of a double blinded, parallel- group study in which patients with previous heart disease were treated with conventionally dosed statins for eight weeks. The results showed that escorts to higher doses of statine reduced total cholesterol and lower lipoproteincholestic levels than usual treatment. This was followed by an investigation into the effects of fixed dosage combination of 10mg plus atorvarstatin on lipid profiles, oxidized low density lipometry, high sensitive Creactive Protein, and soluble Intercellular cell attachment molecule. A doubleblind trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of fix dose combination between ezetimbe 10 mg/week or simvacin 10 milligrams per day on reduction of total LDL cholesterol as compared to standard therapy. After four weeks, eligible patients are rand and Omized to two double-blinded placebo-control trials. When eztimibe is added to On-going Simva Statin therapy, mean percentage decrease in LD-C attained the recommended treatment target of 2.60 Mmol/L from baseline was considerably larger in the combined treatment over time. Another study was performed whereby type 2 diabetes patients were pretreated with open label rosuvastatiin 10, 10 or 20Mg; they were assigned to either receive add-on treatments with zetamibe at 10 Mg or increase of the regimen's rocuvastapin dose to 5 Mb/day. These subjects were divided into two groups: one group received zymbe up to 10 Gm/Day or another group would receive zmoyal additions such as 10Gm+Zetmire or 10Mp/Simvasite. Both groups had significant reductions in both LLD-c and other measures of improvement. Although there has been no direct evidence for these changes, several studies have examined the safety and effectiveness of adding zingtimebe to statinate therapy in patients who are very high risk for chest disease. One study compares the efficaciousness and safety of switching from statink monotherapy to intensified statn monothérapie in hypercholsterolemia and Coronary Heart Disease. Two further studies examine the anti-irritability and blood vessel function of increasing zeltmiebe/sigmatin together with intensifying stat"
29397561,"Aim: to evaluate the effect that ezetamibe on insulin-sensitivity and lipophosphorylation in obese and Dylipidaeic patients. Methods This study was performed in 12 obese subjects with Type 2 diabetes who were assigned 1 : 1, Eze/Siv 10/20mg, or Rosuva statin 20 mg per day for 16 weeks. In this study, we examined the effects of two different regimens; one group received ezetimibe as an add-on treatment while the other groups received placebo. The results showed that both groups reduced LDL-cholesterol levels significantly. These results were not related to any changes in blood sterol concentration or glucose metabolism."
24954489,"The prosthesis is fixed in the bone, but there is little evidence for early movement of the prostheses. In this paper, we describe a method to evaluate early migrating of single-radus total knee replacements by measuring the stem's motion and then comparing it with conventionally-operated knee prosthetics at four years after surgery. This study compares two different types of cements: Simplex P, which has reduced wear and mechanical failure; and SimpleX AF, an advanced polyethylene material that has improved wear resistance. We also examine the effect of weight bearing on the prostesis during total hiparthroplasty. A prospective study was performed between February 1996 and March 2000 regarding 43 consecutive patients with hip osteoartrosis receiving an uncetered and hydroxyate-coating prosthem. All patients receive an Uncemented and Hydracon-Coated Prosthesis with An anteverted Steerforth stem. After three months, no significant differences were observed between the two groups. Translation and rotation are not seen among the cemented or unceremented group. There is still uncertainty about whether the type of fixation should be fixed directly to bone or without cement. Cemented Fixation is preferred because of its high wear resistivity in laboratory tests, while uncemented Compressed Fixations need resorption of bone mineral into the implant. Bioactive Cox-2 inhibits migration when used as postopment analgesiometry. He concludes that cox 2-inhibits increase prossummigation in total joint replacement."
29739343,"This is a cross sectional study of elderly patients and controls. The subjects were divided into three groups: elderly people, elderly controls, and young controls who had not been in the hospital for at least one year. In this group, physical performance was measured continuously during sustainedmaximum contraction until exhaustiveness. Biomarkers were calculated on blood cell counts and plasma concentrations of inflammation. These markers were then compared with those of older persons without lung disease. They were further analyzed in an observational population-based study called the ""Health Aging and body composition"" which included 3075 participants aged 70-79 years. A crosssectional analysis was conducted of the baseline results to examine the relationship between inflammatory marker and ventilatorry limitation, muscle strength, exercise capacity, as well as other measures of health. Results showed that there was an association between these markers and age-related changes in function. Older adults had higher levels of interleuin 6, phosphorus, tumor necroseis factor, alpha,and IL-1Beta. This study was part of another study entitled ""Invecchiar in Chianti"" wherein 1020 older adults were asked to assess their bone mineral density, dynamic balance, muscular strength; and serum levels from various cytokinic markers."
24714894,"This study focuses on the association between excessive weight and high blood pressure in Tunisian children. The results suggest that changes in lifestyle are associated with increased risk of high-blood pressure, particularly in young boys and girls. In this study, we examine the prevalence of hypertension amongst schoolchildren in Al Ain City, UAE from September 1992 until May 1993. We conclude that there is a significant association for overweight and obesity among adolescents. Our main outcome measure is the proportion of teenagers with high Blood pressure. Prevalence of High Blood Pulse among students in ouro Preto city, Brazil. Biochemistry, clinical and physical activity and history were used as predictors. Out of seven80 schoolkids sampled, the risks of obesity were greater in subjects who presented high TTriglycerides and low high Denyl lipoproteincholesterol level, and those who present low birth weight. Body mass Index was significantly related to both body fat and muscle mass in females but not in men. To determine the causes of variations in blood tension, based upon age, education, family history, weight, height,and body mass index, respectively, an unifactional analysis was undertaken among 1001 Italian youths aged 10 -18 years. Age, educational status, additional butter intake With diet, Family history ofhyptension, BMI, Heights and body Mass Index were found to contribute 64.6 %) of the total Variation of Systolic or Diastopic blood Pressure. These results indicate that it is important to know the cause of these variations because they may lead to elevated blood levels in patients with severe coronary disease."
25427719,"The effects of adrenoroceptor-blockers on sixteen patients with mild and moderate hypertension were studied. Arousals were significantly reduced in the treatment, but not by acebetasolol. This study examines the effect of beta-abrenotoxicator blockers as an alternative to conventional therapy in treating essential hypertensies. Thirteen uncomplicately treated patients were divided into three groups: placebo, pindaloL or metoprolOL. Each group was given one dose of either drug for four weeks. In this study, blood pressure and pulse rate were measured at the end each week. Both drugs showed significant reductions over the course of the trial. Although there were some side effects, no significant differences were found between the two groups."

The aim of the study is to compare the strength and performance of three different adhesive systems on primary tooth surfaces. First, a single bond system was used; second, it was applied after half time of acidetching. Third, there were four experimental groups: 1) self-etchation, 2) dry orwetbonding etched, and 3) one-step Self-Etching Adper EasyOne. After 24 hours of water storage, specimens were divided into four subsets according to their application. They were then tested for failure mode at 0.5mm/min. Finally, they examined the effect of cutting speed on the bond Strength of Two Adhesives to Primary Dentin."

The study is a prospective, cross-sectional study designed to determine the effect of workstation changes as well as an intervention with ergonomics. In addition, it examines the relationship between neck and shoulder pain, headaches, and fatigue in new hires who are using e-collaboration tools. A pilot study has been performed to investigate whether group training would reduce discomfort when compared to ""no treatment"" control group. Sixteen experimenters participate in 6 weekly two-hr groups sessions of 'Henry Computing' while 12 control participants receive no training. After six weeks, the experimental group reports significant reduction in most bodies symptoms as Compared to the Control group and /or increase in positiveworkstyle habits ; such as taking break at the desk or taking breaks at any time during the workday. An investigation into the use of progressive lenses for eyeglasses has also been carried out. Although this study does not directly relate to injury, there is some evidence that they may be useful for relieving pain caused by vision problems."
28251287,"In this study, we examine the effect of resistance training on muscle mass, strength, and function in older adults. We compared two groups of elderly subjects: those who received either leucine or placebo; and those that received only exercise training. The results showed that both groups had improved their health-related status, body composition, quality of life, depression, fatigue, etc. They also found that they were more likely to lose weight than gain it. This was an important question because many studies have shown that diets can improve physical health in old people but little has been done on the effects of food alone."
28215182,"This paper focuses on the use of the pain scales in the assessment and evaluation of acute pain. It is important to note that there are differences between the VAS and the verbally numerical rating scale, but it is not yet clear whether this difference is significant or not. The study uses an observational cohort of patients with acute painfulness who score their pain on either a 100mm non-Hatched Vascular Analogue scale or by using self-rated pain scores as measures of improvement. A minimum clinically significant difference occurs when the subject describes his/her pain as ""a little less"" or ""little worse."" In contrast, the mean change from current to preceding scores indicates that the patient's pain is improved. Although some studies have suggested that changes in pain severity may vary depending on gender, age, and cause of pain, these studies do not show any relationship between pain intensity and pain relief."
25577154,"The antihypertensionive and lipid-lowing treatments to prevent heart attack trial is designed to compare the efficacy, safety, and predictability of losartans in patients with high risk of heart failure. In this study, we examine the effect of long-term Angiotension Conversion Enzyme on coronary reserves and cardiovascular structure. Losartan has a significant effect on stroke risk than conventional therapy. This study also shows that treatment with angiostensin-converting enzyme inhibitor reduces blood pressure by reducing the primary end point of death, stroke, or myomycardial infarction. Although no differences were found between groups for different disease subtypes, they are not statisticallysignificant. Diabetes mellitateus is one of the strongest risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Diuretics have been recommended as first line agents for treating hypertension. However, these studies do not show any difference in the effects of diuretic regimens on cardiac and vasodial structures. These studies suggest that an ARB blocker may be more effective in preventing heart attacks than either calcium channel blockers or an anitotensine-converting enzyme inhibiter."
29088103,"In this study, we examine the efficaciousness of a single probiotic combination, BifiDobacterium-BBG-001, to prevent necrotizing Enterocolitis in preterm children. We conclude that it is possible to reduce the risk of complications from late-onset enterocotis by reducing the severity of the disease with syphilis. This study also focuses on the effect of two different types of antimicrobials on infants' gut health: 1) Lactobacilus rhumnosus G and BIfidobacterialum infantis; and 2) placebo. The primary aim of this trial is to determine whether probiotination will improve growth and development in very lowbirth weight prematurely weighed pregnancies. It was found that feeding these babies directly would not result in improved growth or development. However, there were significant differences in the rate of Necrotizing Nec attained in both groups. These results suggest that giving such an effective proliferating strain of yeast to pregnant patients can be used as an anti-inflammatory agent against intestinal inflammation."
31835340,"In this paper, we describe the use of a novel approach to determine the role that magnetic resonance and MRI play in the detectionof early joint damage. We examine 42 patients with recurrent rheuumatood arthritis who underwent conventional methods of examination, arthography, and ultrasound. The results were highly compared with those obtained from plain radiography, clinical measures, HLADRB*1/04 genotyping, or plain medical exams. This study was designed to evaluate the specificity of Magnetic Resonance Imaging for detecting early bone erosions as well as other signs of disease in patients suffering from RA. It was based on an eight-year prospective follow-up cohort of 46 patients treated by conventional treatment. After six years, all patients had improved. To further our understanding of the efficacy of these newer approaches, here we report the results of two studies: first, using gadolphium-enhancing magnetic reconversion technology, which can be used at multiple joints; and second, employing spectral imaging to detect fractures in wrist joints. These studies were approved by the American College of Physicians."
31907492,"In this paper, we examine the effect of feeding infants with soy-flour formula on regurgitation. We find that feeding a high-fiber formula reduces initial daily incidence of reguration in young children who have cow milk allergy. This study is designed to determine whether or not early consumption of such products can increase the risk for cow's milk allergicity. The results of this study suggest that early feeding with dairy-based formula may be associated with an increased risk of cowmilk allergy when compared to feeding infantilely-fed formula at the delirium. Our aim is to assess the efficacy of these two different approaches by comparing the taste, smell and texture of the three different types of milk used to provide infant care."

In this study, we assess the effects by psylliium on insulinsensitivity and other characteristics of the metabolic disorder in an at-risk adlescent population. We also examine the effect of fermentable fibers on weight maintenance, appetite, and fat in patients with prediabtes. Acute studies have suggested that strong fiber preloads may induce increases in feelings of satisfaction and reduce energy expenditure. However, few studies confirm these claims. The present trial consists of two groups: one group is assigned to consume either an energy restriction diet or an Alginate-Based Preload Supplement; the second group receives glucomlann as epportunely designed stimulants. It was found that glib fiber can improve blood pressure and antioxidant status among overweight and obese subjects. Furthermore, it has been reported that viscous fiber might increase sateiety and thus reduce body weight. Although there are many studies reporting the benefits of fiber over time, little is known about its efficacy in improving bowel health."
15145632,"In this study, we examine the effects of a group-based relaxation training program on weight loss in patients with Type II diabetes. The subjects lose more weight than those who receive control treatment and demonstrate greater declines in their disease control. This study is an attempt to determine whether stress management training can improve blood glucose control in type 2 patients. It is shown that motivational behavior therapy reduces hunger and physical activity levels in older women with non-infin-dependent Type 2, but no significant differences are apparent between groups. A brief intervention for improving adherence to prescribed lifestyle changes was studied in this paper. After one hundred patients had completed assessment at three time point-basement, three months, and one year, they were divided into two groups: an intervention group which received the brief tailored intervention including follow up telephone calls, or usual care controls group. Results showed that the intervention produced reductions from fat consumption and increase lifestyle physical exercise levels. Another study examined the effect of an intense educational approach on improved glycation control among patients without insulin- dependent Type 2. This trial included eighty patients assigned to either minimal instruction program, education program of single visits, Education program incorporating another group education course, Or behavioral program. These four programs all produced improvements in Hba atid body weight. Depressed patients were treated with depression treatment."
16299094,"The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a system of process measures on patients with back pain who are at high risk of developing chronic disability. A set of objective measures for technical competence, consistency of care and total performance all significantly relate to satisfaction of workers. In this paper, an ergonomics program is used to improve work performance in patients suffering from low back injury. It is reported that half of the solution is implemented according to their perception of it. This paper also reports that there is reluctance among employees to implement the program because they do not feel that it will lead to improved return to work. Back school is recommended for patients experiencing acute work- related lowback pain. There is no evidence of its efficacy in treating these patients. However, problems solved by problem-solutions have been shown to be effective when added to behavior grade d activities as well as daytime sick leave. Although bed rest has been advocated for certain conditions, such as sciatica, little is known about its effectiveness in relieving symptoms of lower back discomfort. To prevent further development of chronic disease, several different treatment methods were studied. One was based on supervised early intervention; another was followed by omished treatment. All three groups were similar at baseline. With regardto satisfaction, the patients received more satisfaction with the treatments than those in general practitioner programmes at all follow ups."
27605376,"This paper focuses on the effects of long term sick leave on health-regarding quality of life in subjects with severely obesity. The results of this study suggest that patients who lose weight during their illness have improved physical and mental health, but not as much as those who gain weight after surgery. In addition, there is little evidence for a relationship between short-term absence and job loss."
24318196,"The aim of the present study is to evaluate the long- term survival of 105 patients who receive consecutive series of primary knee replacement using the press fit condyllar posterior  Cruciate Ligament-Reaching prosthesis. In this prospective study, we compare the results of cementless fixations with those that are cemented. After five years, the Knee Society score improves significantly from pre-operative means and after operation. A cementfree fixed bearing torso tray without screwholes is performed in a group of 54 knees. The hospital for special surgery scores improve from an average postoperative score of 53/100 to 80/ 100. This study also examines the effect of adding cement on the migration of bone stock during the first two post-opportunities. We perform another study on 57 knee arthrooplastys treated by NexGen.

It is primarily based on multivariate stratification, which includes age, femalesex, previous stroke, and hypertension. The results of this study indicate that the absolute risk for stroke in these patients is relatively low. In addition, there are several independent risk factors associated with stroke: history of prior stroke; left ventricular hypertrophy; abnormal LV Ejection Fraction; and serum total cholesterol. These studies provide important information about the relative risk among different types of patients suffering from non-valvular fibrillation."
29119371,"In this paper, we describe the results of a five-year observational prospective study in which patients under age 55 were enrolled in an open-access registry for primary total hiparthroplasty.

Constrained linings have been used as part to salvage hips at high risk of dislocation after total knee arthrostry."
31684688,"In this paper, we describe the results of an irrational treatment for girls with Turner Syndrome. The patients were assigned to either a single dose of human growth-horoscope or two different regimens: 1) GH alone or 2) ox plus rolone. This study was designed to examine the frequency of reporting bias in trials that included only one meta-analysis of the primary outcome. It found that more than half of these studies did not report full data for any reason; however, 50 p.m. and more of those potential results were missing. A nine-point classification system was developed to assess the extent of missed outcome reports in randomised controlled trials. All subjects received either high-dose gh or combination of both cynogenes. After three years of treatment, the mean height increased by 2.7 cm as compared to the expected adult height at the earliest time of trial. On average, all women receiving combination therapy had greater gains in their final height than untreated girls. We conclude that it is better to wait until after 9 years before starting treatment because there are many younger girls who have higher bastardly heights when they start treatment."
25701331,"In this study, we examine the effects of glucoannan on serum cholesterol levels in healthy men. After two weeks, the subjects are assigned to either a placebo group or an active fiber-supplement group. The results show that Glucomann reduces total cholesterol concentration by 10 pg., low density Lipoprotein cholesterol by 7.7 pp. and trigllycerides by 24 %.

We compared two groups of patients: an experiment group consisting of 11 healthy men and 5 women; age 62.4 yr; height 1.00 m; mass 69.4). Similarly, another group consisted of 9 healthy people and four women. This study was designed to compare changes in muscular performance between arm and legs in patients who had a stroke. The results showed that arm muscles were more sensitive to age than leg muscles across age. Musculoskeletal velocity was also important in strokes because it was associated with greater force loss."

It uses a double blinded, randomed, placebo-control trial to assess the effect of short term supplementation on mood and cognition in elderly women. In this study, we examine the association between folate, B12, and B-6 nutrients and memory performance as well as polyphenol intake. The results suggest that long-term folicacin treatment can reduce hyperhomocousysteinemia but not improve other risk factors. A recent observational study suggests that daily  Folic acid can be used as an anti-thrombotic therapy in patients with elevated blood levels of glutathiamin."
30050958,"In this paper, we extend a previous paper's definition of essential items to describe the most important aspects of any published trial. We use standardized methods to select essential item from existing quality-assess tools and evidence. The first item is ""Batchound"" which describes how patients are treated in hemodylysis. Second, there are several other factors that contribute to the severity of the disease. Carnitine insufficientness is responsible for many comorbid conditions such as dialysis-induced anemia. Third, L-carntine improves blood lipid profiles in maintenance heodialysis patients. This study compares the effects of two different forms of carnintine on cholestrol levels: 1) those who receive carnicine daily have fewer symptoms; 2) those with no underlying disease do not have worse results. Finally, these studies examine the effect of leptominic treatment on body weight and exercise capacity in end-stage Renal Disease patients without improvement in their health or quality of life."

This study compares the efficaciousness, safety,and tolerabilityof fluvoxam controlled release to placebo in subjects with generalized anxiety disorder. In mixed-models of each outcome, the independent variable was primary interest represented remain on either drug or switcher. These results are compared among patients who have been on the same drug before CATIE; those who had switched to another drug were less likely to stop the study drug than they did when they had been taken prior to a change in medication. Furthermore, previous analysis of data collected from Catie showed that patients ""r and Omly assigned"" to switch to one of the other drugs were more likely not to discontinue the treatment than those whom had already been taking the original drug. Therefore, this study examines whether flunariusine can be used as an alternative to bipolar I therapy in patients with stable but chronic DSMIV- defined schizophrenia. It also assesses changes in body weight after six weeks of treatment. Bipolar II patients treated with lamotrierine or lithium were found to have greater weight gain at week 52 than controls."
29292213,"In this study, we examine the effects of two fatty acid treatments on blood and lipid function in patients with chronic renal disease. The first is bezafisibrate, 200mg twice daily; the second is a combination of -3) ecstasy acids. We conclude that both are effective at reducing hypertrigallyceridemia. This study also compares the effect of fibrate and omega-3 fats on lymphocyte Secretory Function and Systemic Inflammation in Type 2 Diabetes mellitateus. Both treatment results in improved glucose tolerance and reduced lipoprotein levels. A sub-study was performed to determine whether gemfibrozl could reduce the risk of heart attack in subjects with high-denity lipodysis. It was found that it was associated with elevated fasting glucose levels and increased insulin resistance. Fenedofiberate or extended release niaspan were used to treat hypothyroidism. These drugs have been used as an anti-cholestrol therapy but have not been shown to improve either endotriumal function or other risk factors."
20739918,"In this paper, the authors describe a patient group with acute low-back pain but no sciatica caused by an ""omized disc prolapse."" They conclude that there are many patients without back pain who have recurrent symptoms. A follow-up observation study is performed in 15-year old schoolchildren to determine whether or not they have persistently high levels of chronic low spine pain. The results suggest that children with more severe and long-term back problems may be at greater risk of developing these conditions than those without them. This study also examines the relationship between magnetic resonance imaging and other measures of health. It is reported that people with lower back injuries tend to have more frequent episodes of pain because of their increased nerve root compression."
23959778,"A prospective follow-up cohort of 120 adults with mild to moderately severe autism was followed from childhood until adulthood. The following instruments were used: the Diagnostic and Statistical Outcomes for Autism, the World's Most Serotoninrgic Disorders, and the Generalized Assessment of Symptoms and Compulsiveness. Six out of the 120 patients had died during their follow up period; six declined participation. While there are no published studies on the efficacious use of fluvoXamine in children with or without autistic disorders, it has been shown that this agent is safe and effective. In this study, we examine the effects of two randolated 8-week phase of fluid fluoxetine on repetitive behavior in childhood and anadolent disorder. This study compares the safety and effectiveness of both morphine and placebo in acute treatment of children who have pervasive development disorders. We conclude that these conditions may be associated with resistance to antipsychotics. Although atypical agents such as clomiprimine and haloperidone are more commonly used in treating people with serious psychological problems, they are not well tolerated in those with specific symptoms."
25345420,"This is a case control study of 120 children with newly-diagnosed attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. In this case, the subjects are matched to age, gender, and health condition in order to compare treatment with asthmatic or healthy children. Melatonin has been shown to improve sleep, behavior, cognition, quality of Life in children who have newly diagnosed ADHD. A strength training program was used to increase functional capacity, muscular strength, body composition, as well asquality of life in 22 young patients with anorexico outpatients. The results indicate that there is no difference in the severity of symptoms after 12 weeks of treatment. Although CBT is established as one of the first line treatments for anxiety disorders, little evidence exists on the effectiveness of this form of therapy in low and Middle-Employer countries. There are few published studies regarding the impact of long-term treatment on health-respective qualityof life; HrqoL in individuals with attention-deprived/hyperactive disorder is limited. However, relatively few trials have addressed the effect of treating long term subjective,psychisocial outcomes, such as ""health-related quality"
25044052,"In this paper, Festinger et al. found that payment in cash or gift card were associated with improved follow-up attendance and reduced tracking efforts. A previous study showed that attention-disease disorder creates heightened risk for adverse driver outcomes. This study examined driving performance of adult men with attention deficit hyperactivité disorder by comparing the disorder to controls in double blinded cross-over designs. The subjects consumed either pill or a placebo in counterbalanced fashion. After both tests, subjects compared themselves on an inter-modified oddball task. Both groups showed improvement in their driving behavior under the placebo condition. These results are interpreted as early sensory processing impairments in older adults with ADHD which may be partly overcome through effortfulness. Adolescence females with Attention-deficit/hyperaction disorder are differentiallyresponsive than their male peers to extended release stimulant medications. They also showed greater improvements in motor vehicle performance when they received morphine date at 1 hour post-dose. Methmylphenidate is the most frequently prescribed drug for ADHD; it has been shown to improve performance during driving simulators."
9470890,"Back pain is a common cause of back pain in many different types of patients. In this study, the effect of an eight-week exercise program on lowback pain has been studied. The results suggest that the program can be used to prevent back injury and improve patient health."
29609665,"Two experiments are performed to assess the risk of bias in evaluating the effects of different concentrations and types of calcium Carbonate on pigs. In one experiment, a diet containing three different levels of Ca Carbonates is used to determine ""attractive total tract Digibility"" or ""stand and ardize total Trch Digible"" for roosting rats. The results indicate that feeding more than one type of diet can lead to overestimation of the efficacy of each diet. A second experiment is conducted to evaluate the effect of increasing the concentration of ca Carbonated on digestibility of both feed-to-growing hogs as well as weanling birds."
27550905,"In this chapter, the author focuses on how poorly reports of a controlled trial are collected and how it is analyzed. Although many studies have been published in recent years, there has been little evidence for their efficacy in preventing or reprimanding for poor results."
31264084,"In this study, we investigate the effects of acute resversveratrol over a period of four weeks on endometrial function in patients with obesity. We conclude that rand-over treatment is superior to placebo in terms of improving endogenhelial functions. The results of this trial are described in detail. A large number of overweight and obese subjects were randomized to either rat or placebo for 4 weeks. After the first intervention period, brachially artery flowmediated vastodilation was measured before meal consumption. At the conclusion of each intervention phase, blood pressure, arterial compliance, and performance at the endof each 6 weeks were also determined. No significant differences between groups were observed between the group : N = 53, R = 54 ; P = 5.0077 for per protocol. Abstract This paper reports on the efficacy of rape-induced weight loss in type 2 diabetesmellitus patients. It uses an animal model to assess the effect of propranolgy on Type 2 disease."
27898180,"In this paper, Dr. Rivers discusses the potential of using a negative-apical irrigation system to reduce pain after an infected root canal treatment. He uses two different irrigation techniques to assess the effect of size and preparation on the amount of irrigant that can be delivered to the length of the root Canal prepared in time. The first technique is conventional needle irrigation; the second is passive ultrasonic irrigation with endovac irrigation. This study compares results of three different methods for treating dogs' teeth with periaponical lesions. Apically negative pressure irrigation was used to treat dogs with periodontitious lessions. Precisely, all four groups were equally efficacious: ANP = 20; Passive Usonic Irrigation = 10; EndoVac = 12; and Privi = 16; each group included 40 roots. After 18 days, animals were treated by histotechnic processing under conventional and Fluorescence microscopes"
27124611,"In this study, we examine the relationship between physical activity and symptoms of depression, fatigue, pain, and selfefficacy in persons with a chronic stroke. The results suggest that patients with an acute stroke may be better able to return to normal activities after recovery. This study also uses accelerometers as ancillary devices to assess changes in physical function in people with several sclerosis. It is shown that there is significant change in quality of life for individuals with multiple Sclerosis when they wear an electrode attached to their wrists or ankles during the first week of their attack. However, it is not clear whether these changes are associated with improved health or disease severity."
23002379,"In this study, the authors compare the severity of a patient's response to treatment using the positive and negative syndrome scale with the score of the Clinical Global Impressive Score. They conclude that patients who are not adequately controlled while on cloza pine or rosperidone have significant weight gain during their treatment. The results of this trial indicate that compared to placebo, cynically treated patients in severe chronic schizophrenia have greater improvement in the Brief psychiatric rating scale than in those who were previously assigned to another antipsychotic. This is an important finding because it suggests that switching from one antipsyotic to other may be more effective for patients with inadequate response. A parallel-group investigation comparing the efficaciousness and safety of different antipants in patients suffering from severe acute schizophrenia has been performed. Ninety men aged 18 years or younger were assigned either open-lated treatment with  Clozapino or blindedas treatment without another newer ""atypical antipolitic"" drug. Twenty people with sickly symptoms were given randoments with three different drugs: d2-dophinrgic antagonist ; sulpride / bristol; and haloperoide. These studies showed that both regimens resulted in improved scores on the Becky-Pranson Syndrome Scale as well as improvements in overall symptoms."
29228348,"In this study, we examine the effect of daily flax seed consumption on blood pressure and glyceric control in prediabotic patients. The results suggest that fatseed can be used as an effective anti-inflammatory aid. We also assess the changes in body weight and other lipid profiles after 12 weeks of Flaxse's consumption. A comparison between the two groups was made. Both groups showed significant reductions in fasting glucose, insulin resistance, C-Reactive Protein, and interlolenic-6 decrease. This study is further supported by a double blinded crossover study where subjects were assigned to either diet with low carbohydrate or grain flour for 42 days. All measurements were performed before and after intervention. Blood pressure, anthropometry measures and serum values of isopropstane,c-reactiveprotein,glucosine, lipophosphorylation,tumor ncrosis factor-alpha, sugar,lipidic profile,uric acid absorption, Leptin,and insulin were measured prior and at the ends of interventions. Flaixs seeds have received attention for their anti inflammation and antioxidant role. Prior studies had evaluated the effects upon CVD riskfactors of manipulating levels of /n-3 Fatty acid using food and extracts or investigated themetabolite fate of docotsahxaen Oic acid and algal oils by changing the ratio of these two fatty acids. No previous studies have examined the interaction between dietrations and supplementations with EPA and Davanoic Acid; however, no previously published studies found any relationship between such ratios. Therefore, it is concluded that both types of foods should be added to the diet of women who are pregnant."
27278232,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the association between heavy alcohol consumption and menstruals irregularities. He uses a controlled diet to examine the effects of moderate-to-heavy alcohol exposure on women's reproductive health. The results suggest that drinking moderately increases the risk of breastcancer but does not seem to be associated with other disease-causing consequences. Anderson concludes that ""moderate to heavy"" alcohol use is associated in several different ways with various complications: early meno Pause, spontaneous abortions, and breast cancer. However, there is no clear relationship between these adverse effects from alcohol-induced changes in female hormones. This study also investigates the effect of acute alcohol treatment on growth-hormone regulation. It was found that patients who consumed large doses of alcohol had an increased risk for developing breast malignancies than those who did not drink."
11279762,"In this paper, the authors present a prospective, i.e. in--outpatient study of patients with acutely psychosis who are under treatment for neuroleptic therapy. They describe twenty-eight patients aged 20- 60 years who had been treated with either flunitravepam or halopridol during an aggressive incident. The patients were assigned on doubleblind basis and their symptoms were measured over time by the Overt Agression Scale and Brief Psychic Rating scale. Although recent efficacy trials of right unilateral electrodes have not been studied in real life, we conclude that these studies may not be suitable for patients suffering from major depressive illnesses. We include two groups of subjects: 1) patients without major depression accordingto DSM-III criteria with severity; 2) patients having less severe major Depressive episodes or other comorb conditions. This group included patients receiving electroconvulsionsive therapy at 5 or 2 times seizur threshold. These patients received both treatments. Their outcome was measured blindly as the scores on the Hamilton Rating Score for Depression were calculated. Furthermore, they used pre-planned treatment to determine the cause of agitations in patients attending the Rouen hospital emergency room. There was no significant difference in cases of aggression between control and treatment groups. However, there was one patient who showed severe parkinsonnism after being given I.M' haloperidal."
28126565,"The aim of the present study is to determine whether low 25-Hystericalvitamin D concentrations are related to risk of heart disease in patients with severe heart failure. In this study, we compared the effects of high dose vitamin D on blood pressure and endothelal function in elderly patients who had suffered a sudden stroke. We found that higher levels of 25 HhV were associated with increased risk for coronary heart diseases. Furthermore, studies suggest that low-25H V may also contribute to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. This study further investigates the efficacy of single large doses of either ergocaliferol nor choleculirol in improving blood flow and inflammation in people with type 2 or chronic kidney disease."
23633374,"This study aims to determine the prevalence and severity of atrial fillation in patients aged over 70 years. It uses a cluster-rand-omised control trial to compare the efficacy of two different methods of detection: pulse taking or electrocardiography. The primary outcome measure is newly identified atrium fibrillation. A multi-centred clustered controlled trial was designed to assess whether screening improved the detection of this arrhythmy, and to evaluate the cost-effectiveity of different strategies for detection; including targeted or entire population screening, compared against routine clinical practice. In addition, it examined the value of echocardiogram as additional risk stratifications for thrombimbolic disease with an elderly population. Atrial Fillations is regarded as one of the most important risk factors for heart failure and stroke. However, many patients are unable to detect this condition by using conventional electrodes because of their small size. An electrode assembly that can be used to diagnose these conditions has been developed. These studies aim to examine the gender differences between men and women who attend flexible sigmodorioscopies. They also report on the frequency of strokes among people with attriotic atarrhythmia. Although there is little evidence regarding the effectiveness of such approaches, they suggest that some form of intervention may be necessary."
28407810,"The Cost-Efficitness of a Home-Based Antimalarial Regiment in Children: A Pilot Study In Karachi, Pakistan, the control of blood pressure and risk attenuation trial was compared to three intervention programs: home health education, combined with trained general practitioner, plus trained nurse midwife; and no intervention or usual care. This study examines the cost-efficacy of these strategies. It is shown that this strategy reduces patient's bp by almost half in the combination group. However, it does not lead to any significant savings for community-based regimens. Although there are some costs associated with delivery of Iptc through village health workers, they are relatively small relative to the overall cost of treatment. Costeffectiveness studies were carried out using standardized methods within an Indian clustered trial. An economic analysis was performed on the impact of different interventions on infant mortality. For example, maternal asphyxia had been reduced by 45 %) in one intervention arm while childborne antimetic treatments had only risen by 46 % in another."
26420598,"The effect of Calcium and Vitamin D on Bone Mineral Density in Post-Opausal Women. In this trial, we examine the effects that calcium and vitaminD have on bone mineral densiputation in patients with low energy fractures. We find that they lose more bone than placebo after a single day of treatment; however, there is no significant difference in bone loss between the two groups. This study furthermore investigates the use of milk to prevent bone degradation in women who do not receive estrogen or progesteron. A double blinded, placebo-control trial was conducted for three years to assess the efficiacy of calcium supplementing on hip bone deposition. It found that it was superior to placebo in terms of reduction of bone mass. However, these results were not statistically significant."
30746868,"This study aims to prospectively compare the results of robotic-arm assisted total hip replacement and conventional manual surgery. The aim of this study is to assess the complications of both methods. Aim Robotic-Assisted Total Hiparthroplasty has been controversial because of its wide exposure of the patient's femoroid, and it is therefore necessary to perform this procedure in a controlled fashion. In this paper, we describe the effects of robot milling on bone remodeling in cementless whole hip arthrostomies. We evaluate the effect ofrobot millering in crushing cementlessly total knee ostrepsis in comparison to manual implantation. Although there are some drawbacks with the use of an externally guided approach, such as impingement and bearing surface wear, no significant loss occurs at the periprostesthetic areas."
31933471,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of sex on atrial fibrilation in women and men. He discusses the current state of knowledge regarding asymptomaty and quality of Life in patients with atrium fibrillation. This is an important issue because there are few studies that directly relate to symptoms or outcome. Anderson concludes by stating that ""there were 481 - 12 % who were able to respond to any question about their condition at baseline""."
27395329,"In this paper, we describe a pilot experiment to determine whether the effects of ion-fortification in school meals can be used to predict changes in children's health. The results are mixed: there is no difference in growth, morbidness, or mental function between groups of children who receive fortified powder and those who don't. We conclude that these children have improved their health by improving their concentration, intelligence, and physical fitness. This study also examines the effect of multiple-monutrient-enriched foods on brain development. Children with high levels of blood resuscitated from antheminic therapy show better performance on tests than children with low levels; however, they do not show any significant differences in intelligence or behavior."
10796331,"The effect of oxalamine on bone loss is studied in elderly patients who have been treated with it for the past two years. In this paper, we describe the results of an eight-year study that examined the effects of different types of OXA1D therapy on hip fractures in older women. We conclude that both regimens are safe and can be used as preventative measures against future falls. A double blind, placebo-control trial was conducted to evaluate the efficaciousness of 1,75-dihypvitamin D/calcitriol over six months in treating elderly people with osteoporia. This study showed no significant reduction in Bone Mineral Density in the elderly subjects. However, there was a significant decrease in bone mineral denseness in stroke patients because of malnutrition, sun deprivement, and immovization-induced hypocalcemia. There were also no differences in blood concentrations or creatinine levels after treatment. An ongoing clinical trial of three years duration was being undertaken to determine whether any lasting benefits remain if the treatments are stopped. Women's health initiative has been established to investigate the use of low-fat diets, breast cancer, heart disease, postmenopause, vertebral injuries, etc. These studies aim to reduce the risks of these diseases by reducing the risk of injury from motor vehicle accidents. They include: 1) using calcium carbonate, 2) using vitamin D3, and 3) using meth and Ienone. After 2 years, most of the decline in bones occurred in all 3 groups; however, they had rapid bone losses in their first year. Finally, one year later, pregnant women received only 1200 mg of calcium and 500 IU of Vitamin D daily. Osteostoporoseis is associated with reduced bone mass but does not affect overall bone turnover. Calcium and alpha-Hyphovin D increase bone density in men with premenomepausal conditions."
28332506,"In this paper, we describe the results of a community-based trial that compares self-tiration to two multicomponent theories-informed tailored intervention in women with hypertension. We conclude that home-centered blood pressure monitoring is an effective treatment for patients with uncontrollable blood levels. This study furthermore examines the effects of remote patient management and physician care on control over 12 month period in overweight and obesity patients. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether homeblood pressuremonitoring has an impact upon clinical characteristics, metabolic profile, and quality of live in obese patients who are not controlled by their own health. A cluster-rand-omized pilot study was conducted in New York City's medical system where all patients received usual care with home bloodpressure measurements or were remotely monitored without physician visits. After six months, only about half of them had their bloodpressed at the end of the trial. Although control rate has improved over time, disparities in hypotension control persist. An intervention designed to help patients asking questions atthe point of care improves blood tension control; however, it does not have any significant effect on mortality. For example, there is no evidence that telemedicine will reduce the risk of stroke in postmenopause women suffering from abdominal obesity. Telemedicine is also promising but still unproven because it lacks case management services. It is difficult to assess the effectiveness of these new technologies in real life setting out of service for the follow up and control of chronic conditions. These include diabetes, heart disease, weight loss, cholesterol, high-denity lipophosphorus, etc. They do not show any differences in baseline values between the groups. Self-management of blood pumps leads to lower blood flow in patients treated with conventional care. However, some studies have shown that people who receive traditional care can have greater reductions in blood force than those who get regular care alone."
28249299,"This study focuses on the effects of three different dosesof exercise on total white blood count, neutrophil and monocyte levels, as well as markers of inflammation. It is a long-term, controlled trial in which fifty overweight and obese men were recruited from volunteer sources. The purpose was to investigate whether weight loss and exercises affect leptine and if they predict weight Loss. In addition, the study examines how serum lespitin predicts fat loss."
25879093,"In this study, we examine the efficaciousness of a single dose of dehydromepi and regimentone for postmenopalisal women without receiving estrogen therapy. The results indicate that the group receiving 200-mg of testosterone increases the frequency of sexual episodes by an additional 2.1 times per week than the placebo group. This is significant because it suggests that Dhea may have specific effects on the central nerve system. A double-blinded, placebo-control trial was conducted in which 816 women with hypo active sexual desire disorder received either 150 or 300 milligs of T-testosteron daily or placebo. At 24 weeks, the increase from baseline to 4 weeks in the four-week frequencyof satisfying sexual episode was significantly greater among the groups receiving 300-microg each day than in those receiving placebo; but not in all groups. We conclude that menopause is related to diminished lean body weight and increased fat as aging declines hormonal secretion. Estrogans or estrogen-and-rogen therapy has been used to relieve vasomotion symptoms, however, although these are also used for pain relief. Although there is some evidence that dehyoepit and rosterone can improve physical function, no concluding studies have examined the effect of such treatment on patients' health."
24464831,"The French-Languistic Society of Papediatric Anaesthemists has developed a national study to track the incidence and morbidities of local anesthesia in infants. In this paper, we examine the effects of acute epidural Anesthesia on pain scores after elective colorificial surgery. We compare the effect of general and spine anesia on short-term outcomes of newborns who are delivered electively by cesareanous section. A comparison between spinal and general anemia is made. Major complications are reported in both groups. There is little difference in postocular morbity in either group. Postoperative mortality is similar in the spinal or generalane groups but there is no significant change in patient satisfaction. After major abdominal surgery, patients receive continuous epidural analgesis for 72 hours. These studies have been used to determine whether epidurally anated patients can improve recovery following major abortiful hip surgery; however, they have not yet been published."
24513112,"This study aims to compare the results of two different types of pulpotomic techniques: ferric-sulfates and mineral trioxine aggregate. The first group is used as an experimental technique, while the second group uses formocre sol or MTA as dressing agents for primary morals. In this study, we examine the success of both methods in preventing tooth decay. We conclude that the use of either method is superior to the other because it removes coronal pulp from the teeth without degrading them."
29498201,"In this study, we describe a novel treatment for advanced breast cancer. We compare radical resection with conventional surgery in patients with localized or metastatic disease. The results of the first two trials are similar: overall survival is superior to those of either regimen. Acute chemoradolysis improves survival for patients who have locally advanced or distantly advanced malignant tumors. Although there is still uncertainty as to whether adjuvant treatments can be more successful in treating these patients, it is now clear that they should be given cautiously."
24406123,"A prospective cohort study is designed to predict the risk of sick leave for workers with shoulder pain during their first 6 months in primary care. The results of an examination, a series of sociodemographic factors, disease characteristics, and symptoms of shoulder disorder are used as predictors. In this paper, we describe the current state of knowledge regarding shoulder disorders and provide evidence on the efficacy of anti-inflammatory medication, corticostosteroid therapy, or physiotherapy. We also discuss the use of patient-reported shoulder scores, including the Oxford Shoulder Score, which has recently been extended to include patients with other shoulder conditions. This study uses the American Shoulders and Elbow Sturgeons Stand and Ardized Shouldar Assessment Questionnaire to assess the validity of the shoulder function assessment. It was found that the score was 6.7 points out of 100 possible scores. Furthermore, the Italian version of question naire had poor reliability and validity."
28196512,"This paper describes a lifestyle-based intervention for patients with schizophrenia. It is based on an eight-week program that involves group exercises, meal planning, and self-effacing. The main outcome measures are weight and body Mass Index or BMI. In this study, the primary endpoints were mean change from base in body weight after week 16 and clinical efficaciacy was calculated. Although no single agent has been found to correct multiple metabolic disturbances such as hyperlipidemia, inflammation, obesity,and fat distribution, we report that ramelteone 8mg/d adds significant weight loss and prevents or reverses the medical complications caused by antipsychotic drugs in people with sick mental illness. We conclude that there is little known about the extent of commorbidity in persons with severe mental illnesses in the United States. However, studies have shown that ""cognitious/behaavioral"" intervention can be more successful in preventing or reducing Type 2 diabetes than metformin, Troglitaze, or placebo. Furthermore, these studies suggest that patient-reporting outcomes may not be as important as those reported in controlled trials."
27738515,"In this paper, we describe a novel approach to improving adherence to the use of fixed dose combination drugs in patients with acute myomyocardial disease. We aim to increase fidelity to preventive therapy by introducing an environment-friendly routine and modifying patient beliefs about how to take the pills. This is important because most patients who have had their first heart attack or stroke do not take any type of preventative medication for long-term. Therefore, our study uses ""fixed-dose combinations"" to assess whether they can be used as effective secondary prevention agents in low- income and middle-class countries. Our main objective is to determine whether it is possible to use these antiplatelets, statins, and angiotension-converting-entzyme blockers as well as polypill strategies to improve blood pressure control in stroke survivors. The results of this trial are described in detail. Acute Myophycal Infa Rct Ion: Adherence To Evidence Based Cardiovascular Preventive Drugs After An acute Myofa Ction is Low After the First 6 months. Fix-Doe Combination drug for Secondary Cardioval Prevention ) was designed to date factors which interfered with appropriate acclimation to cardiovascular medicine after an acutely severe MI. Additionally, six95 patients from phase 1 were re-empowered into another controlled trial. These studies showed that using fixed dosage combinations could improve efficacy over time; however, no previous trials have examined the impact of such approaches on  adherence. Furthermore, there has been little success in reducing risk of stroke complications among patients treated at the point of surgery. Although most people with high-risk diseases receive only one or two prescriptions per year, many physicians fail to provide adequate care for them. For example, some patients suffer from hypercholesterolism."
22041335,"In this paper, the authors describe a small, single-centre study that suggests that atrial fillation can be treated with pulmonary vein ablation. However, it is not compared with an appropriate pharmacological strategy for patients with both left ventricular and atrium fiilation. The aim of the study is to identify shortcomings among the management of these two groups. Acute fibrillation and heart failure often occur in cardiology practices, and they frequently worsen one another; but little has been known about the efficacy or safety of this combination"
23219100,"Walking and riding to school are a common source of physical activity for pre-primertal children. This study examines the association between walking and bicycling in young boys and girls aged 7 to 9 years. The results suggest that walking or bibing to schools may be beneficial for improving bone mineral content and bone width. In this study, overweight and middle-aged children were compared with their normal weight peers. They showed that they had more physically active activities than their non-overly active counterparts. Overexcessiveness is associated with increased risk of noncommunicable diseases."
26546969,"In this study, we examine the effects of pravastain on exercise compared to placebo in a group of patients with hypercholestrolemia. After six weeks, there is no evidence of any reduction in exercise capacity or cortissol or catechoamine responses. The results suggest that simva statin does not significantly alter stress response and therefore must be investigated elsewhere. A prospective, idiogenetic study was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and toleability of loveastatin as an anti-hypercholesteroling treatment in young girls with heterozizygous familyal hyperphosphosterolemic. This study used randolescent females who were aged 10 to17 years and had been previously treated with diet alone or with lova Statin. They were then divided into 2 groups: one group received either 20 mg / day of solvastatn or placebo; the other group took 1 tablet daily. Both groups showed significant reductions in total and LD cholesterol. Their follow-up was extended for 10 years after their trial."
23796797,"In this study, we examine a pooled set of three population-based studies in Denmark to determine the association between smoking reduction and quitting. We find no significant main effects of either genotype or treatment type on abstinence at either ends of treatment or 6 months after their initial cesation attempt. Our results suggest that there may be some gender-specific differences in these relationship. For example, women carrying both A1 and DRD2 allele are more likely to quit than women with only one copy of the long allele. This suggests that different genetic variants may have different efficacy in different forms of nicotine replacement medicine."
27727432,"This paper focuses on the cost of depression. It uses population-based and economic evidence to estimate the impact of depressive disorder in Europe. The study is a mixed-effects, placebo-blind, double blinded trial with 100 outpatients from two sites. In this study, patients were treated with either S-ADENosyL-L MEthionine or placebo for 6 weeks. A significant improvement was observed in the treatment group when compared to control groups. Furthermore, there was an association between changes in plasma intermediates and change in Hamilton's Depression Rating Score as well as logistic regression. Serotonin responds better than any other treatment except sis-adenomethione. CSF levels were lower in vivofacinated patients suggesting that it may be disturbed by methylation; further studies are needed."

In this study, a prospective cohort of 206 consecutive patients who have had an acute episode of atrium fibrillation in the past three months are compared to matched historical control groups. Acute-onset atary fibrilation is one of most frequent disease states in emergency department medicine. Although there is no universally accepted treatment for this disease, physicians from the medical service and the Department of emergency medicine devise standardized approaches for treating these patients."
28477308,"In this paper, the authors present a number of recent studies on the benefits of exercise training after myomyocardials. They conclude that there is no significant difference in the rate of progress of coronary lesions between patients assigned to ""normal care"" and those assigned with ""multifactor risk reduction."" The results of these studies suggest that lifestyle changes can reduce the severity of angiographical atheroscian lessions. A group of light exercise regimens improves health-related life for patients who have been treated with conventional care. This study compares the effects of home-based heart-retrieval therapy to supervised physical activity in post-morbidity and stroke patients. After six months, both groups show improvements in blood pressure, body mass, and fitness. These results are not surprising since they indicate that women do not need any additional intervention."
11574449,"The aim of this paper is to determine whether the use of practice-based education in a controlled, patient-centered fashion improves quality of care for patients with asthma and Type 2 diabetes. This study compares three forms of follow-up: general practitioner care, i.e. shared between the General Physician and the Clinic; and conventional clinic care. In both cases, blood pressure and metabolic control improve significantly. Acute complications are more severe in the experimental group than those of the controls. An improved system of outpatient care was also found that increased frequency of scheduled visits were reduced by the intervention group. Another study examined the effect of using an integrated approach of treatment and teaching for adults with poorly controlled type 1 or Type 2, as well as the effects of additional training on nurse case management. These studies examine the effectiveness of routine care and physician education over the course of one year's time. Although these studies have not yet been published, they suggest that physicians may be better able to respond to changes in patient health when nurses and pharmacists are involved."
17846060,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to stroke prevention in elderly patients who have recurrent atrial fibrilation. They focus on two risk factors for stroke: 1) age and 2) history of hypertensity. The first is that older patients are more likely to develop stroke than younger patients. This study uses an extended follow-up period to determine whether warfarin can be used as compared to aspirin or other anticoagulant regimens in patients with high risk of heart attack."
26501062,"This paper focuses on the use of an instrument to predict patients' outcome in low back pain. It compares the performance of risk estimation with assessment using the Orebro Muscuoskeletal Pain Scoreing Questionnaire, the Lowback Pain Perception scale and a predicted rule for this purpose. The outcome was unfavourable condition: having no clinically important improvement after 6 months. A mini-intervention strategy was used to improve patient care through targeted treatment for subacute lower back discomfort in general practice. In this study, physicians were trained to assess andmodify prognostics factors and usualcare for patients with non specific chronic low Back pain who were not yet 12 weeks old. They were then asked to identify their own pain pathways and set specific goals as to how they would respond to these changes. These included physical symptoms, anxiety, somatizanation, and fear avoidance beliefs. Their results were compared to those of other patients suffering from chronic oblivious disease. For example, depression and anxiety are known to increase the risk of exacerbitation in patients treated by general practitioners. However, there is little evidence that such approaches work. Thus, this paper uses standardized questions to determine whether patients experience greater relief after one year than when they receive standard care."
26725071,"In this paper, we describe a prospective study of the effect of three different forms of topical cream on boys with pymosis. The first is ointo-doctored in two groups of boys aged 3 and 10 years old who have been suspected of having physis; the second group is placebo-controlled. After 30 days, all patients are assigned to one of these groups. Parents are instructed to use the formula twice daily for 60 days after their initial consultation. Aim: Phi Mosis is common papediatric urology disorder and often needs circumcision. We prospectively evaluated localsteroid therapy ""LST"" as the first option for such children. This treatment has been used since the time of Circumcision, but several published studies have suggested that more conservative approaches may be more effective in managing this condition. Preferred subjects were divided into four groups: 1) 80 boys from January 2004 to February 2008. 2) 70 boys between 4.1 and 12 years older with disease treated with either highly potent or moderatelypotent topicals. These boys were assigned by r and Omized choice. They were then given an appropriate amount of each type of preparation before they were subjectesed to application of either valerate or clobtasol butyrate. Boys were allowed to retract the skin gently without pain and apply the topically cream over the ostotic opening twice weekly for 4 weeks. If no improvement was obtained, parents were instructed not to remove the forenskin again. To further assess the efficiacy of both types of corticoteroids in boys, our study consisted of two sets of 20 boys every rated at retractibility. Each boy was assigned once daily to receive either betamethaone valetrate 0.2 %) or cabetatsone butychate 0.05  percent. Both groups received good results. Foreskins were graded d from 1 to 5 based on severity of disease. Pediatric surgical practice with unretratable foreseskins was considered phimosistic. Two groups included 40 boys age ranging from 4.0 to 6 years. One group had hyalurisondase applied directly around the predutial margin while the other had alcove cream. Results were very good. There was no side effects or problems after any treatment. Purpose Between 2 pp and 5 per child with persistent or path"
25300397,"In this paper, we describe the results of an irrational comparison of two patient-specific guide systems for knee arthrostry. The first system is based on pre-operative planning and the second uses surgical navigation as an Introductory control. This study compares the accuracy of three-pointer component alignment with conventional instrumentation in total knee replacement. We also examine the relative merits of different types of instruments to determine whether they can be used alone."
30293906,"In this study, the safety of combination treatment with so-lifenacin or mirabgron is compared with that of monotherapy in patients with moderate to overactive bladder. The results indicate that combination therapy reduces the relative risk of acute Ury retention, BPH related surgery, and clinical progression over four years in men at elevated risk for progression. A large dose-ranged trial explores whether combination treatments can improve health-regarding quality of life. Two preference-based tests of health status are used: International Prostate Score -- IIEF 5-L and OAb-q -- which are calculated by responseers. Solifeccain 5mg combined with Mirabegroan 25 or 50mcg improved efficaciousness in treating over active bladder; however, it was not found to have any significant effect on urinary symptoms. This study also examines how well alfuzosol and tatamsulonsin can be used as an overactivity bladder treatment in elderly patients. They were divided according to severity of symptoms and age group. After two weeks, they were assigned to either soli plus tocas or sildenalafil alone. These studies examined the effects upon urine flow rate, residual urinevolume, international prostate symptom score, sexual function, etc. It was concluded that these studies were useful for older patients who experienced greater symptoms than younger ones."
32149404,"Children undergoing complex heart surgery are assigned to either total circulationatory arrest or high-flow Cardiopulmonary bypass. The results of the study indicate that infants with transposition of great arteries have worse neurodevelopmentally outcomes than controls. In addition, children with hypophosphorus left heart disease have greater risk of developing permanent hearing loss after open heart surgeries. This is due to the fact that they have more severe congenital defects than healthy control subjects. A second study investigates the relationship between seipsis and neurocognition at age 2 years after conventital heart diseases. These studies suggest that patients with hyperphosphorous left hearts may be at increased risk for long-term brain development."
23360949,"In this study, we examine the efficability of individualized electroderofeedback in treating children with attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity disorder. All children complete the study and attend all study visits or training sessions. Parents are more effective than usual in improving home behavior in children who have attention-deficit/hyperactivité disorder because they are better able to control their own behavior. The use parent training for Early Intervention with Adhd children is discussed. Twenty- five boys age 7 to 13, with a diagnose of ADHD were assigned to either therapy group or support treatment control group. Results included parental and teacher scores of the child's behavior problem checklist-attention problem subscale, self-control rating scale, parent ratings upon the Modified Weiss activity scale and matching facial figures task. This study investigates the effects of essential fats on blood composition and behavior among children suffering from attention deficit/Hypteractivity Disorder. A double blinded placebo-controlled cross-over study was performed on thirty-five children; fifty-one children received either an Efa Mol ® or olive oil placebo. Children were divided into three groups: one group received EFFamol alone; another group took PFA plus micro nutrients; and finally two groups received both types of treatment. Both groups had significant improvements in performance but did not show any improvement in overt behavior as measured by parents or teachers. Two studies examined the effect of combined working memories and inhibitory controls training using EEG. One group showed improved results when compared to waitlist conditions while the other group saw no difference in symptoms. There are few empirically supported psychological treatments for children affected by attention Deficiency/Chilenging Hierarchies. Brain Snack: Many studies have found that brain function can be improved through neurofeedbrain training. For example, there has been some evidence that eating foods that provoke symptoms may lead to changes in mental health."
27489205,"The aim of this study is to compare the survival rates for amalgam and traumatic restoration treatment in primary smiling teeth over three years. All restorations were performed according to the Conventional Restorative treatment method, using amalgam, a trauma-restorative approach, and an ultraconvenient treatment. In addition, there was no significant difference in the cumulative survival after 3 years between the two groups. This study also focuses on the cost-efficacy of the Art-Amalgam technique as compared to conventional restourative treatments. It has been reported that it can be used as part of preventive or restoative programmes for older adults."
22992251,"This paper focuses on the association between maternal 'use of multiplevitamin supplements' and their babies' risk for congenital defects. It uses a case control study to examine the effect of adding n-3-fatty acids during the first half of pregnancy on placental growth and omphallocele in infants. The results suggest that additional dietary sources of fat during this period may lead to increased proliferating cell nucleus, which is associated with an increased number of pregnancies. In addition, mothers who receive only iron or folate during their pregnancy are at greater risk of developing neural tube defects than women who have been given folic alpha by other means. A double-blinded trial was conducted to determine whether periconceptal multivitains can prevent recurrent nerve defect in pregnant women. Women were divided into four groups according to their ante-conceptional status: 1) one group contained 0.8m of floric acid; 2) two groups contained seven other vitamins; 3) one included copper, manganesine, zinc, and another containing no trace elements; and finally 4) one contained either phosphorus or iron. Pregnay outcomes were measured in 500 female patients from two inner city cities."
29453672,"In this study, we examine the effects of fish oil on leptenin concentrations and adonosetin expression in rats. We also investigate the role of n-3) polyunstained fatty acids in Type 2 diabetes. A doubleblind, parallel-controlled trial was performed to evaluate the effect of omega-3 on circulating alpha-lipoic acid secretion as well as blood lipid levels. The results showed no significant changes in lelptine concentration or paraoxone activity. Most systematic reviews rely upon the assessment of method logical quality of trials. This study determines whether consumption of millerd flax can affect glyceric control, nicotrophin levels, and body composition in individuals with Type 1 diabetes mellitateus. It is concluded that flacseed oil does not affect these characteristics."
28063111,"Acute brain lesions, such as those caused by atrial balloon ablation, are common in patients who have asymptomatic atrium fibrillation. Although there is no concluding evidence for the safety of these procedures, it is suggested that they may be more successful than conventional methods. In this study, we compare the success of two different approaches: cryo balloon and point-bypoint radiofrequency ablation; and pulmonary vein isolated using either openirrigated or contact force sensing technology. The results suggest that both strategies can be used to achieve freedom from attic arrhythmies with little risk of complications."
30627080,"In this paper, we examine the influence of physical activity on risk of cardiovascular disease in overweight and obese adults. We use a prospective observational study of 257 14 adult men from Dallas, Texas who were aged between 43.8 and 10 years. The results suggest that moderate and vigorous activities are associated with better health outcomes than moderate or vigorous ones. This is an important finding because it supports the notion that vigorous exercise may be more effective in preventing type 2 Type 2 diabetes than milder exercises."
26912127,"In this paper, the authors describe a six-Item brief mental status examination that is used as an assessment of patients' mental health. They use it to assess their ability to respond to emergency care in patients who are experiencing agitation because they do not want to be observed by physicians or nurses. The results of this study indicate that haloperiddol and benzodiazapines are more effective in treating acutely psychoic patients than either regimen alone. A retrospective chart review compares the efficaciousness and safety of two antipsychotic regimens: quetiapopine with lithium or divalpropex plus Li/ DVP for treatment of bipolar disease. This study also examines whether mood-switching is associated with depression. It was found that there were significant differences between the changes on the Positive And Negative Syndrome scale from baseline to second hour after the first dose. Although no recent studies have investigated the effects of rapid tranquilizers on pacified patients, several new treatments have been developed since that time. Intramusculic drugs such as halopridola and ziprasidonare have recently been approved in the U.S; however, none of these new agents have yet been studied in general. Many psychiatrists still practice conventional neurolepts to treat patient suffering due to anxiety. There are few studies designed to evaluate the effect of short-term administration of epilepsy. However, many doctors still rely upon conventional nerve blockers like morphine and promethazin. These newer approaches include transcranial shock therapy, which involves electrodes placed into the brain at high pressure to induce seizure."
26917939,"In this study, we examine the frequency of headaches in a general population and determine whether they meet the 1990 international headache society's definition of  Cervicogenic headache. We assess the reliability and validity of the ""cervicoskeletal flexionrotation test"" to discriminate patients with headache caused by C1 dysfunction. This study also focuses on the use of hand-held instruments to evaluate headache severity. The results indicate that there is little difference between the severity of symptoms and those who suffer from cerviolegiatric pain."
26806655,"In this study, we assess the efficacity and safety of two different tadiclesins for treating men with lower Ury tract symptoms suggesting benign prostatichypoplasia. We also assess relationships of baseline severity and prostate-specific antigen to outcomes. A total population of 1,451 men aged 45 years with lumbar dysfunction were studied. The results showed that naive males who had no signs of erectil dysfunction improved significantly after taking either one of these drugs. Preferred treatment was not available in all patients. This study further examined whether the effect of both phosphodiesterrase type 5 and alpha blocker treatments were able to improve urinary function in men suffering from BPH. Although there is some evidence that they can be used as an alternative treatment, it is not clear whether or not their effects are influenced by changes in other laboratory tests."
24307487,"The safety and effectiveness of antihypersive agents for hypertensives have been questioned, but this study is the first to compare mortality and Morbidity outcomes among patients with peripheralartery disease. In this paper, we describe an open-label trial in which 24 patients were assigned to either captopriml 25mg twice daily or metopriolol 100m/d per day. This treatment significantly reduced blood pressure and improved walking distance. A further study was performed in 12 patients who had intermittent clacudication. These patients showed improvement in walking speed and painfree walking time. Two other studies examined the effect of beta blocker on blood flow in patients sufferingfrom peripheral arterial disease; one included a double blinded crossover trial wherein 28 patients received propranosoloL 80mG once daily as well as perindopurl 4mM per week. Although both drugs did not improve walking performance, their effects were greater than those of placebo."
29474713,"In this paper, we examine the use of short-messaging services to improve blood pressure adherence among Chinese patients with acute coronary disease. We describe an initial study in which we tested the efficacy of a short message service for improving medication abstinent among patients who received multiple doses of antiplatelet or statin regimens. The results showed that patients were more likely to follow instructions and take their medication on time than those who did not. A second study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an e-mail-based system for improved medication fidelity among older adults with cardiovascular disease whom no one had previously prescribed. This study examined the effects of two different approaches: 1) an ""electronic pill box"" and 2) an app on your smartphone."
26225902,"In this paper, the authors present a novel treatment for major depression. They describe two hundred fifty patients who received either munlessepristone as an antidepressedant or placebo and report that they experienced rapid and sustained improvement in their symptoms after seven days of treatment. The results are similar to those reported in other studies. A further study is presented on the influence of medication resistance on short-term recovery in patients with severe mental illness. Eighty five patients were included; twenty-seven were female and 24 were male. This was followed by another study regarding the efficaciousness of amitramine alone, perphenascazine only, or acetonine alone. These patients showed significant improvements in both the Hamilton Rating Score for depression and the Brief Post-Psychiatry Rating Scale. Moclobemidie was also studied in this study. It was found that it was superior to trimipramini in terms of its ability to suppress the hypothalmacmic-pitumary-abrenocortal system. Another study was performed on 100 depressed patients using ECT. After four weeks, these patients improved significantly in the outcome. However, there was no difference in severity between the groups. Finally, we examined the use of combination opium and sertraline in unipolar Major Depressive disorder. Both drugs were more effective than placebo in improving mood."
27113121,"This is a double blind, placebo-control study to determine whether vitamin B6, B12 andfolic acid improve response to antidopressant treatment in patients with DSMIV-TR Major depression. The results of the trial suggest that zinc may be more effective than either of these two treatments. In addition, it has been reported that omega-3 polynsaturated fats are associated with depression; however, little evidence exists regarding their efficacy in depressed patients. A recent study suggests that an amino acid mixture can be used as an add-on to Remeron's antidepressive drug regimen. It was found that all three active treatments were better than placebo in terms of improvement on Hamilton Rating scale for depression over time. Furthermore, this study investigates whether sensitivity to inflammatory markers could be involved in the effect of combination therapy. Forty-three subjects participated in one of four trials: 1) citalopRAM plus omega 3 fatty acids -- versus 2) monothérapie -- or 2) olive oil -- combined with 3) sertraline. All patients received either 1000mg EPA or 20, mg fluoxetine at the start of treatment. After eight weeks, they showed significant improvement upon Hamilton Depression Rating Score. Another study reports that tryptoplex might be beneficial in treating major depression because it increases blood levels of prolinein."
26626069,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effect of a walk-to school program on children's daily physical activity. The results suggest that walking to school can be an effective intervention for improving physical health in low- and middle-class American children. Anderson concludes by stating that there are few studies that have examined the effects of walking-school-buses on kids' daily activities."
30462233,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of an implantable heart-rate-defbrillator as a preventative measure against sudden death in patients with high risk of arrhythmics. He uses standardized patient treatment regimens to predict whether or not patients will experience inappropriate shocks during their first trial. The results of this study suggest that delayed therapy may be more effective than conventional therapy in reducing the number of prematurely pacing patients who receive ICD therapy. Anderson concludes by describing the German De Ville registry, which collects information about all patients receiving an Icd from various manufacturers. This registry contains 1,411 patients and is comprised of 3261 patients for primary prevention and 719 for secondary prevention."
21901722,"This paper describes the results of a study on quality of care among general practitioners in England. The aim of this study is to assess variation in patient satisfaction and identify factors that contribute to high quality care. It was concluded that patients with chronic diseases, such as asthma, angina, and Type 2 diabetes, had higher levels of satisfaction than those without these conditions. In addition, it was found that there were cost-effective strategies for smoking cessesation in general practices. A cluster-rand-omized treatment trial was conducted whereby physicians received payment for their services but did not receive any additional incentives. Two financial incentives were given: one for superior performance and one more for improved patient engagement. These incentives increased the number of children who quit smoking within the next three months. Another study was carried out using two organizational support methods: the provision of incentive for better performance by the availability of ""a patient's registry and prompting telephone support system"" and the use of cash rewards for improving physician practice behavior."
31166447,"This study aims to assess the level of 25-hydroxyvind D among healthy Arab Arabian women. The results indicate that 70 - 45 % of females have normal levels of this important mineral. In addition, there is no difference in the proportion of women who have low levels and those who do have high levels. Furthermore, the mean serum 25HD concentration is 86.5 ngmol/L for men and women of group 1 and 2 compared with 50.2 mmol per day for control groups. A total population of 186 Morocco women and 69 men were recruited prospectively. We found these in this study very high prevalence ofhypovitamin Osis D without any difference between men or women; PurposeThe main purpose of our study was to relate and compare the vitamins D status, parathyroide,calcitriol &phosphorus of healthy Morocco menand women aged fifty years and older:. Preparations are made for two studies one year apart. First, an experiment is performed wherein participants receive 500 mg daily doses of calcium as part of breakfast. Second, it is a double blinded study which measures the absorption of vitamin D at two levels by using morphine methods and commercialally marketed calcium pills."
23126575,"A prospective study evaluating the effect of weight bearing on total hip aoroplasty in patients with severe hip pain. The results are excellent, with improved pain scores from 9 to 17 at 5 years after surgery. In addition, there is no improvement in the severity of the injury caused by loosening either the acetular or hysterical component of an arthroplasty. Although the short-term results seem better than those seen in other studies, the long- term follow-ups for new prostheses must be continued for eight years and, if possible, should include 100 percent follow up. This paper describes the use of cemented single-femoral pieces as replacements during primary hiparthroplasty. It also discusses the effects of cementless stems on the performance of prometheus cups."
32322969,"This study aims to determine the effects of probiotics on blood glyceria and cholesterol levels among patients with Type 2 Diabetes mellitateus. The subjects were divided into three groups, each receiving either a control bread or an intervention that included Lactobacilus acidphilus, Bifodobacterialium bfidum, and Frocooligoscosaccharidas. After eight weeks, the subjects consumed either one or two shakes per day. In this study, we examined the effect of consumption of psymbiotic foods on weight loss in elderly patients. We found that the spherical form of the food was more effective than the placebo group at reducing hepatitic steatopsis and improving liver enzymes. Furthermore, it showed recurrent increases in stool frequency in the synmodic group rather than those in both groups. Non-alcoholic fat liver disease has not yet been well treated."
30057608,"The aim of this study is to determine whether the use of a tooth-extraction stent can be used to preserve the ridge that has been lost after tooth extraction. In this paper, we report on the efficacies of using such an attachment to restore the alveolitic crest following tooth removal. We conclude that it is possible to alter the shape of the extracted tooth by using Bio-Oxs, i.e., collagen."
25834275,"In this paper, the first author uses an enhanced soft tissue repair to replace a total hip in patients who have not yet undergone full-expansion of their muscles. The results are highly significant: A direct anterior approach reduces the risk of dislocation by reducing the rate of partial hip replacements before they are replaced; whereas, after the enhanced closed approach, there is no difference in the reduction of the overall dislocation rate. This study furthermore compares two approaches to total knee arthrostomies: one with an indirect approach and another with oblique approaches. It is shown that the direct approach leads to better pain scores and improved function during the initial post-surgery period. Furthermore, it has been reported that preoperative education can improve the quality of life for patients following complete hip surgery."
28577257,"This study aims to determine whether or not daily doses of Ca and D can reduce the risk of fracture in female military recruits during initial training. The results of this trial suggest that carol and vitamin D may improve bone health for young male jockies, but there is no concluding evidence that these benefits are due to increased blood levels of 25-Hysteriamin-D. In addition, stress fractures are common among soldiers who have low concentrationsof Vitamin D. Therefore, this study uses a double blinded, placebo-control design to assess the effect of daily dosages on muscle function and injury in men with low-25HhoD status."
31827125,"In this study, we investigate the effect of two fatty acids, n-3 Polyunstained Fatty Acids, on blood concentration of maloneddehydes and mocysteryle in patients with Type 2 diabetes. We compare the effects of three different types of fats: skim milk, 50 g per day; musfa, 3.75 ng alpha-Linoleonic acid; or MUFFA + 4.0 G both ecosapenteoic acid and docosolahexateenoiciacice. Pregnancy outcomes are improved when women receive a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lowfat dairy products. The Dash diet is richer in fruit, vegetable, full-grain, high-fiber, moderate-grilled diets than it is in conventionally high fiber regimens. This study determines the efficaciousness of four different omega-3 phospholipids in treating hypercholesteremic patients. It reduces fasting trigllyceride levels by up to 10 mmol for each patient. Furthermore, fish oils have been reported to improve small artery functions in vitro. These results suggest that fish oil may be effective in atheroprotective treatment of heart disease."
27611008,"In this study, we compare the recovery of patients who have had a nerve sparing prostatectomy with those who are not treated. After four weeks, they are randomed to double blinded silicdenafil 50 or 100 milligrams or placebo and followed by an eight-week drug free period before evaluation of their erectility. The results suggest that there is no significant improvement in spontaneous eryection after surgery. However, it is clear that Phosphodesterase Type 5 inhibitors can be used to improve penile function. A further study is presented for adult men with recurrent ear problems following brisk retropubic repertinent treatment. This study was designed to assess the efficaciousness of tame 20mg vs. placebo in improving fecility after radical retro pubic pratorectomy. We conclude that these two regimens will provide adequate protection against throbbing pain."
24149519,"In this paper, we use a real-world meta-analysis to predict the effect of weight loss in patients with obstructive sleep absorption. The results are quite similar to those seen in other studies. For example, an observational study suggests that surgery induces weight Loss may be effective for Type 2 diabetes. A prospective, i.e. laparoscopic adjustment of gastric bypass is used to assess the effects of long-term weight reduction on blood pressure and body mass."
24867198,"This study focuses on the use of pre-concusion neurocognition tests to predict recovery time for college and high school athletes who have had concussessions. The results suggest that there is no significant difference in post-consulsion symptoms between White and African American athlete groups, but it does not reveal any relationship between these two groups. A prospective case-control study examines differences in performance on flimsy brain scans between patients with mild or moderate traumatic head injury and controls without injuries. In addition, several studies have examined the value of using computed tommography in minor head trauma. These studies are divided into four groups: low-risk group, high risk group; prediction rule set up by age; skull fracture/posttraumatic vomiting group only; and motor vehicle crash control group. Predictive rule rules were developed to identify patients who had either a severe or mild head wound. ContextAvatable prediction rules used risk factors such as age, Glasgow Coma scale score, bone fracture, or posttraumatic nausea. All patients received blood samples within 4 hours after injury. Brain injury was one of the common injuries observed in western emergency centers."
28275892,"In this paper, the authors describe a prospective, open-label study in which they compare the effects of flunitatepam with haloperoidol for immediate control of acutelypsychic patients. Twenty-seven patients aged 20- 60 years who were undertreatment with neurolept agents were assigned on double blinded procedures to receive either five or one milliliter of halopridola every 30 minutes during an aggressive incident. The patient's agitation was measured by Overt Aggressive Score and the Brief Pedestrian Rating Scale. Both studies showed significant improvement in the treatment of patients with acute psychological illnesses. Although several trials have examined the effectiveness of these three approaches, none have been compared in vivo, doubleblind, multi-centre trial. Nineteen-eight patients were selected from the pool of emergency department patients at five universities or general hospitals. They were given 1 to 6 shots of the same medication within 12 hours; based on their need, each patient received1 to six injections of different drug within 24 hours. A total of 73 patients treated with psychotic or mental illness were randomly assigned to receiving either olanzepine, ziprasidene, half-promethazine plus midazzoam or haploridal alone. After 12 hour, only patientstreated with Haloperidolil Plus Midazolam experienced high levels of aggression and side effects. Sixteen other healthy volunteers were also administered midanzem as well as placebo. Results are described in terms of discsociating the amnesic and sedentic effects that benzdialescenil produces. This combination appears to be superior when studied in both double-blinded and nonblindind trials."
19300334,"In this double blinded placebo controlled trial, patients were given cefasolin at skin inc or cord clamping. The results showed that there was no difference between maternal infectious morbity and the severity of infection in women receiving either treatment. A prospective study at two hospitals examined whether prophylactic antimicillin is as effective for preventing post-cesarean delivery as periocular ampicillin. Eighteen delivered women who had late postpartus endometriitis seven to42 days after delivery received both cephalospoins and cefurosporin before their skin wounds. This study also included an assessment of the safety of extended spectrum regimens of antibiotics on postcesaren section. It was concluded that these treatments are more effective than conventional methods because they do not involve any risk of complications."
26120361,"A pilot study evaluating the acceptability of a modified group therapy for anxious children with high functioning autism spectrum disorder was performed. The results were promising and suggest that this type of treatment may be more effective than immediate or delayed intervention. In addition, there is evidence that family-based anxiety management techniques contribute to the effectiveness of the combined treatment approach. This study also suggests that parents are important factors in the success of anxiety-reducation treatments."
25721432,"In this study, we examine the effect of home-based exercise on gait quality in older adults. We compare three different home based training programs to assess their effects on measures of Gait Quality and Physical performance. The goal is to compare these three with regard to their efficacy on measure of gaits quality and physical performances throughplanned comparisons between: 1) tablet-guided, 2) individual andsocial motivation strategies, and 3) active and inactivated participants. This study uses a mixed modeling approach to determine whether or not balance training can improve health status among older people after stroke. Elderly subjects were assigned to either an intervention group or control group. After 12 training sessions, they measured Fes-I, balance performance, fall-related Selfefficacy, fear of felling, cadence, stride time, Stride length, verbal reactions time; and rates of response. A small angle indicated better stability performance under single task conditions. Although many studies confirm that the positive effect from cognitive and physically training on older adult's mental functions, few studies have investigated the effects of simultaneously performed physical training. For example, in one study there was evidence that dance video gaming could improve balance and gait performance in elderly people. Another study examined whether walking exercises could reduce falls in community dwellers aged over 65 years. Thirty elder individuals were divided into two groups according to age and gender. One group consisted of four weeks of traditional physical exercise and another of dance entertainment. Both groups showed significant differences in step execution during single and dual tasks as well as in backward steps. These results suggest that dancing combined with physical activity may be more effective in improving balance than other approaches. Two trials are also conducted for older patients with knee Ostarthritis. They show that both groups receive similar levels of strength and agility but differ in how fast they move. Finally, several studies evaluate the benefits of multi-component training including motion-walkering and cross-walking. Some studies report mixed results while others indicate that only one type of training has been found to improve gaital stability."
28236962,"The Diabetes Prevention program has shown a significant reduction in the incidence of Type 2 diabetes in adults with impairing glucose tolerance. In this study, we examine whether lifestyle changes can be used to prevent or delay type 2 disease in adult patients with preptibetes. We conclude that lifestyle change can reduce the risk of developing Type 2, but it is not yet possible to translate these lessons into routine health care settings. This study uses telemedicine as an intervention for overweight and obese adults who have been previously treated for Type 1, including those with pre-DigGt. It also compares the effects of weight loss on blood glucose, insulin resistance, and body mass Index."
27595415,"In this chapter, we discuss the effects of high-doses of vitaminD on asthma and cold symptoms. We also examine whether prenatal treatment with high levels of D can prevent or delay childhood wheezeing. This study focuses on pregnant women who are not pregnant at birth to determine whether they will develop asthma or allergic reactions in their offspring. A second aim is to investigate whether higher daily amounts of both ergocaliferol as well as calcecalciol could reduce asthma severity. The results of this study suggest that low-levels may be protective against asthma but that there is still uncertainty about whether it is possible to prevent asthma from developing."
29659440,"This study focuses on the reliability of the functional rating scale, FRI, for use in patients with back pain. The results indicate that the score is highly reliant on both content validity and patient response to the item. A significant difference in the scores between the two groups is found between those with and healthy levels of Back Pain."
23506544,"This paper focuses on the effects of an energy balance intervention for recent retires. It is a one-year program that involves physical activity, fiber intake, portion size, and fat consumption. The results show that the intervention is more effective than usual care in improving physical health. A comparison between two different types of exercise regimens is made. One group uses tailoring to motivate people to improve their physical activities; the other uses motivational calls to encourage them to change their habits. In this study, we examine the effect of lifestyle changes on weight loss among older adults. We conclude that these changes are not associated with increased body weight but rather with changes in physical behavior."
24879789,"In this paper, we describe a novel ablation strategy for patients with recurrent sustained tachicardia. We use femoral electrodes to map the site of the arrhythmic tissue in order to determine whether it will reduce the risk of sudden death from shocks. This is an important step in the development of new methods for treating torso-diseased ventricular thrombus. Our aim is to find out whether transcatheters can be used as an effective and safe method for ablusing venous fibers in these patients. The results suggest that transCatheter abling may be more cost effective than amiodradon over five years after treatment. A recent study suggests that electrical storm caused by VT may lead to sudden deaths in patients using implantable cardioverted defibrallators."
22513945,"In this paper, we describe the results of a study in which patients with atrium fibrillation receive second-line ablation as treatment for their symptoms. The outcome is improved by comparison to AADs. We also examine the impact of different factors on patient quality of life after two years of follow up. Our main aim is to evaluate the changes in frequency and severity of arrhythmic recurrances in patients who have paroxysmal atrial fibrilation. This study was designed to compare the effects of first-time PVI isolation alone or additional linear lessions together with an isolated PV isolation. It was found that these strategies were more effective than either isolation of large area around both pulmonary veinses. However, it was not clear whether they would reduce the rate of newonset left atary tachicardia. These patients had been assigned to either CPVA plus lung vein isolation or circumfferential pulmonary vein separation. They were divided into two groups: group 1 consisted of all pleurisal veins; group 2 included only segmental lesion isolation; and group 3 comprised only circumferential lanceions. After three months, no significant change in blood flow was observed."
28851509,"In this study, we examine the effects of a single site or double-port transumbillic laparoscopic varicectomy on boys with syphilis. We compare the results of both procedures in terms of length of stay, pain, complications, and satisfaction. The results show that the two approaches are more successful than the other."
28229164,"In this study, we examine the relationship between physical activity and risk of atrium fibrillation. We use a population-based cohort to follow 14352 women who reported leisure-time physical activities for the risk that they had atrial fibrilation or if they were involved in an incident of AF. The mean age was 54.6 years; the mean body mass is 26.0 / kg/m2, 26.5 p.m. with hypertension. This study uses medical records from 1997 through 2010 to analyze the association of blood pressure among 12 acute and long-term cardiovascular diseases. Our aim is to assess the different manifestational disease in contemporary populations and estimate the lifetime risks up to 95years of age and cardiovascular disease free life-year's lost adjusted by other risk factors as ages 30, 60, and 80"
26806817,"A pilot study evaluating the efficacy of an eight-week program of physical and mental health education in people with Parkinson's disease. The results suggest that this program may be useful for improving symptoms, functional deficit/degradation, and quality of life in patients with a chronic disease known as Fibromyalsgia. In addition, the study uses fMRI to investigate pain modulation in subjects with fibrojaalgya who have been treated with restorative practices. This study also uses risk-of bias assessment to determine whether gentle Hathak yoga can reduce fibromyosis-related symptoms."
31722229,"In this paper, we examine the effects that a single dose of methylhypni date on children with an attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. We compare the effect of two different forms of stimulant in eighteen children who are age-matched to controls: one group is treated with MPH and the other is not. The results suggest that M Ph may be useful for improving performance in these children."
21276215,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the results of two controlled trials. The first trial was designed to compare the effect of glass Ionomer-Fuji III on caries prevention in children aged 7 and 10 years. This study involved 179 children with newly eupted permanent morals who were not susceptible to carries. After five years, both types of sealants failed to perform well. A second trial examined the effects of different kinds of cements on preventive teeth. Both materials showed good retention but no improvement in the number of tooth that became carous or filled. Another study used fluoride as an anticoagulant for patients with acute myocarious infavoration. It found that the use of resin-impressed fissure sealedants did not lead to significant reductions in blood vessel function."
29594349,"In this paper, we describe the results of a series of controlled trials on restoatives published from 2005-2015. We examine the performance of direct composites in Class I or II cavities and compare them to conventional filling techniques. The results indicate that most of the replacements have no protective layer, but some have sufficient depth to provide adequate protection. A second study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of two different approaches for treating posterior teeth: 1) an incrementally placed bulk-fill material and 2) an ""oblique"" method. This study involves the use of single-compartment selfetching adhesive to form the final restoration. After three months, the patients receive two class 1 restorations with either one of these two methods. They are then evaluated by two blinded observers after 1, 2, and 3 years according to the modified US Public H Service criteria. These studies were used as evidence against other treatment strategies."
30770235,"In this paper, we describe the latest developments in the field of systematic reviews. We present a double blinded crossover trial of long- acting injectable antipsyotics for patients with Bipolar I disorder. The primary outcome was time to regain normal mood and proportion of patients who had recurred any mood episode. Risperdone appears to have no prosphylactic effect on bipolar patients. This is an important first step in understanding the use of newer forms of antipsychotic drugs in treating biphosphorous patients because it is the first available form of therapy that can be used as long term treatment."
23737033,"The effects of conjugated estrogens on vaginal symptoms, urinital atrophy, and sexual function in late-postmenopaausal women have not yet been reported. In this paper, we report the results of a doubleblind, placebo-control trial that compared the effect of two different doses orally of Estradiol over the course of 12 weeks in patients with mild to severe menopause. We conclude that both regimens are safe and efficacious; however, there is no evidence for long-term use of estrogen as an effective treatment for these conditions. Women's health initiative trials suggest that using estrogen replacement therapy may improve mood, cognition, quality of living, sleep, etc. However, their results do not seem to improve mental health."
12917933,"In this double blind study, we compare the effect of adrenocent blockers on pregnant women with pre-pregnancy hypertension. We find no differences in blood pressure between groups after 10 weeks and that there is no difference in glyciemic levels after 12 weeks of treatment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of antihypensive drugs on pregnancy-induced hypotension by comparing maternal blood flow before and after receiving either drug. After nineteen normal pregnant patients were treated as controls, they were divided into three groups: A) hydrallazine or propranolel; B) atenosolol or low sodium meal; and C) labetalioll or methyl dopa. Both regimens significantly reduced blood tension but did not cause any side effects. Women with mild chronically hypertensives were assigned either rand omily allocated to either medicine or be in control group. There was neither significant change in birth weight nor mean gestation age. Pregnancies complicated by pregnancy are followed prospectively throughout pregnancy. Twenty-four women had evidence of uninheritable disease during pregnancy who were followed prospectively throughout their pregnancy for several months. No changes in outcome were seen in both groups. Although bloodpressure control was similar amongst the two groups, coupled therapy with hyalazie and pin dazed monotherapies was superior to conventional methods. Fetal growth was also improved in the combination of these two treatments. This paper discusses some of the recent studies concerning the use of beta blocking agents in pregnancy including an open trial whereby pregnant mothers were given either metopropolic or aldoparoline. It found that although it was more efficacy than placebo in terms of control of hypertention, there was no risk of premature labor."
31860749,"This is a double blinded, placebo-control trial that aims to determine whether iron therapy will improve symptoms of patients with heart failing. In this study, 459 patients were treated with iron as Ferric carboxymoltose or placebo for 52 weeks. The results showed improved symptoms in both groups. Aiming treatment with I.v. iron would improve the symptoms and functional capacity of chronic heart failure patients who had left ventricular fraction  45 %. Methods: We enrolled 42 patients from New York City Heart Association class II orIII, validated Left Ejection Fraction between 40 %) or less; iron deficitiency was ferritin at 100 ngg/mL If transferrin S saturation was 20 0%. Patients were assigned one dose of Intrvenous Ferrric CarboxymalTosses or Saline over four weeks after HF stability and before discharge. Results were improvement in 6Mwt distance over 12weeks. Iron supplementation may improve exercise capacity in patients suffering from acutely decompensating heart fail. However, there is little evidence regarding the efficability of IV iron in treating anemia. Three studies have examined the effects ofIV iron on restless legs Syndrome. One uses FCM but does not show any significant change in fatigue. Another uses monofer ® which has been shown to be more effective than either solution in improving haemogen levels in subjects with severe irondeficiencies. This study extends the previous trials by using iron sucrose instead of ferric Chloride. It also compares iron management guided only by serum ferritsin and transferrein saturation to control blood transfusion requirements. These studies aim to assess the safety of different IVI formulations while considering the potential for adverse side effects."
25605408,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to exercise in warm-water. They describe an eight-week regimen of hydrotherapy for patients with chronic chest failure. The results are quite favorable. A prospective, open-label study has been performed on 104 children aged 1 to 14 years who were assigned into either two groups of treatments: 1) balnotherapy or 2) topical corticsosteroids. This trial was designed to assess the safety and efficacy as well as severity of life in asthmatic patients. It is concluded that both treatment methods have significant positive effects on lung function and quality of airway inflammation. Balneo therapy has also been used in several other diseases, such as rhinitsis, nasal polyps, and acute and chronic sinonusitis. However, no studies have examined the efficacity of these particular treatments. For example, one study suggests that ""inhaled salt bromide-Iodine Thermal water"" may be beneficial in treating upper and lower pulmonary disease. Another study compares weight loss from bMI over 'one year' using utmost control. Finally, they conclude that spa therapy is superior to conventional medicine in terms of improving health."
31007780,"In this study, we examine the efficacy of a single-chamber catheter ablation for patients with persistent atrial fillation. We compare the effects of two different methods on left ventricular function: 1) by using pulmonary veins isolation and 2) by medical rate control. The results show that both methods work well in treating these patients. Atrial Fiilation is one of the most common heart failure problems. Antiarthrotic drugs are effective but have not been shown to be as effective as they should be. Catheters are more advantageous in terms of blood flow than drug-based regimens."
27820712,"In this paper, Barlow focuses on the cost-effectiveness of adult abductionsm. He reports that men aged 65 to 78 years have lower mortality rates when they are invited to have an ultrasound examination and follow-up. Cost effectiveness for these events is estimated at $ 19,500 per year. The study also discusses the use of age-recognized routine reminders as an aid in preventing patients from having an aortysmm. This paper describes how it was possible to improve patient compliance with routine preventive care tasks by using an automatic electronic medical record system."
24847960,"This paper focuses on the association between vitamin D and hip fracture in patients with a form of Parkinson's disease. It compares the prevalence of this condition with that of healthy controls, and then describes the setting of the study. In this paper, we examine the relationship between bone mineral density and the risk of fracture among elderly women with or without PD. We evaluate the use of thiamin MK-4 as an adjuvant to prevent hip injury in older women who are not treated with this treatment."
18348591,"In this study, we investigate the risk of falls among older adults in a large community-based hospital. We found that men and women had different levels of physical activities, stroke, arthritis of knees, and increased bodies sway. Men were more likely to fall than women because of changes in their body size and strength. A comparison between two flooring types -- carpet and vinyl -- in the bed area was made. This study also showed that leg exercises could be used to prevent falls in older people. The subjects underwent assessment of quadriced strength, reaction time, neuromusculic control,and body shuffle on two occasions prior to beginning an exercise program. After completion of the trial, they showed improved performance at the tests of Quadriceps Strength, Reaction Time, Body Sway on 'firm surface with the eye closed ; and / compliant surface With the eyes open"
21810228,"Back pain is the most common cause of early retirement for German patients. Therefore, there are measures being developed to help patients with back pain get back to work. These include a multi-disciplinary approach that involves physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals. A prospective long-term follow-up study was conducted in order to determine whether breast cancer affects work experience. It was found that women who had been treated for breastcancer were less likely to be discriminated at work than those who did not have the disease. The results showed that an ""integrated care program"" combined patient directed and workplace directed intervention was superior to usual care in terms of improving quality of life. In addition, studies in the U.S. showed improved functional restoration after 12 weeks of treatment. Major depression has many consequences for work function and absenteism. Some studies suggest that adding occupational therapy to treatment may improve outcome. However, these studies do not prove cost effective."
22789023,"In this study, we examine the effects of early behavioural treatment on weight gain among first-epsyode patients with schizophrenia. The results show that patients in Ebi's group gained less weight than they were assigned to routine care during the intervention period. This is an important finding because it suggests that there may be a role for early behavior in preventing or reducing weight gains in people with mental illness. We also note that many studies have found that early behavioral treatments are more effective than other approaches for addressing weight loss in individuals with schizofid disorder."
21203852,"The Comparison of Optimistic Medications For Tolerability Questionnaire is used to assess the efficacy, safety, and satisfaction of topical antiglaucanes in patients with open-angle orifice glimmering. In addition, the questionnaire measures patient satisfaction, physician ratings of pressure control, side effects, as well as satisfaction with the medicine. A Swedish translated version of the national eye institute visual function question naire has been used for this study. It was found that there were significant changes in quality of life between the severity of symptoms and the relative scores on both the visual disability scale and an early visual field. This study also included a prospective observational cohort consisting of 100 fifty-five Japanese patients who had newly detected open angle gliucoma. They were randomized to receive either Betaxolle Plus Laser Trabeculoplasty or no initial intervention. After two follow-up visit visits, they completed the Sickity Impact Profile at the final checkpoint. These studies examined the reliability and consistency of these questions using multiple methods. The results showed that Brimonidine reduced IOP by 8.2 mmHhg when compared against other monotherapies; however, it did not improve overall performance."
28640907,"The purpose of this study was to describe the patterns and pattern of screen-behavior, and to examine the relation between screen based sedential behavior and blood pressure risk factors in representatives of Korean children and teenagers aged 12-18 yr. In this paper, we assess the association between physical activity and cardiovascular disease risk factor in representative Korean young people who are age 12 or 18 years old. We use a cross-sectional analysis of 12,812 U. S. boys and girls over the age of 10, 8, and 11.2 hours each week as measures of change in physical activities over time. Physical activity is best modeled at 'a quadrative function of age' increasing until early adulthood and declining after 13 years. This study uses observational longitudinal methods to assess changes in body composition and health in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. A total of 104 children were recruited from an asthma control group and had assessment performed on biaxial accelerometry for 7 days. Children with active asthma appeared to be similar to those with no wheezeing in the past 12 months. However, they had lower moderate/vigorous physically activity than their peers. These results suggest that there may be some relationship between exercise and muscle function in adults with type 1 hyperglyceemia."
25994094,"In this paper, we describe the results of a country-wide survey on the prevalence of both rheuumatoisd arthritis and sprained knees in France. We estimate that there is an age-and-sex-specified point prevalence for each disease. A follow-up cohort study among 114 women who were free from cardiovascular disease or RA was conducted. The proportion of patients met public health recommendations at moderate intensity physical activities were significantly higher than those of the IT group; however, vigorous activity was not associated with any significant change in patient's quality of life. An 8-week patient education intervention was designed to effect behavior change regarding modifiability of CVD risk factor in people with early-onset rash. This study compares two treatment groups: one received self-effacing education and another received motivational coaching. After six and 12 months, the control group received only exercise training but no other changes in their habits. These changes were compared to the effects of three different types of exercises: 1) home-based exercise 2) aerobic exercise 3) strength training. Both studies were highly regarded as promising approaches to improving patients' health."
21109400,"The aim of the present study is to determine whether continuous infusions of 0.5 percent bupivivacaine intothe iliac-crest harvest site provide pain relief that superior to the relieve provided by systemically narcopioidic pain medication alone. This paper presents a method for presenting the proportion of responseers over 'a full rangeof possible cut- off points as if it were valid for their population'. Although antiinflammatory drugs improve postoperative painful relief after cesarion delivery, they carry potentially side effects. Perioperatic cyclonoxase inhibitors show comparable analgesick efficacy than nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory drug in many surgical designs but have not yet been studied after cearean delivered. A single-centre, 5-week, 1-weekrun-in, 4-week treat was conducted in patients with multiple scratches and central pain issues. Methods: We conducted one-centered, 5 week, 1 week run-and-omized, doubleblind, placebo-control, parallel group trials in 66 patient with MS and Central pain states; 59 Dyseststhetic / Seven painful spasams ; seven painful Spasms -- CBM -- containing delta 9-tetrachydrocanol. Cannabidial, THC, and CBD are delivered via an Oromolucosals spray as adjunctive Analgeic treatment. Quality of life instruments are frequently used as primary outcome in numerous r and Omize trials. One of these studies is evaluating the significance of change in quality of Life instruments by calculating them to mean change on a seven point likert scale. In this study, we examine the effect of lidocaines on concomitants evoked or nociceptative pain in spinalcord injury. It is reported that gabapanentin reduces pain after total knee replacement surgeries. There is no evidence that IVRA will prevent pain from occurring after surgery. Pain intensity is often measured on an eleven-point pain intensity numeric ratingscale where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain. To date, there are only data driven estimates about clinically important differences between pain severity scales used during chronic pain studies. These results relate to changes in pain measures which are most strongly connected with measurable difference in symptoms."
18493163,"This paper describes a five-year study between the Astratech Implants Dental Systems and the Brenemark system. The aim is to compare the two systems primarily regarding bone level changes, and also other factors of interest. In this case, the patients are divided into two groups: 1) patients who have ligature inflammation; and 2) patients with no periodontal Ligature infectment. After 3 months, all the implants are installed except for the Iti Dental Implant System which has an ommed order. He then examines histometrical and ultrastructurally periimplants at menium-term Brinnemarked implants. Histometry shows signs of advanced gingiviis lesion while group B shows more sign of healthy gingivia in the connectively formed epithelus. At 3 years, 97.2 percent of the implant survives. No further changes are observed in pocket depth or tooth mobility after 1 year. Biographs show that crestal bones change significantly under these conditions. All four types of implants have different size/denture attachments but there is no significant difference in bone loss among the four designs."
22947230,"A long-term follow-up study of a prospective cohort of 101 male children with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder is presented. The results suggest that treatment with medication, behavior therapy, and behavior modification improves academic performance in the short term but do not lead to significant changes in later life. However, there is evidence that these effects are permanent. In this paper, we examine the effect of drug treatment on classroom behavior and school performance among children who have been treated for at least three years."
30022830,"In this paper, the authors describe a large-scale study of children with autism who had severe behavior problems. They found that rsperidonoe was more effective than placebo in improving their symptoms. The results were quite similar for adults and children alike. For example, in one study, dandy showed significant improvement on the Autism Rating scale after 6 months. In another study we examined whether combined treatment with psoriasis and parent training was better than medication alone. This trial included 124 children aged 4 to 13 years with PDD's. We concluded that early intervention in these disorders appears promising; however, it has not been well studied in pre-school children."
26692005,"Iron-deficient anemia in chronic kidney disease is frequently required parenteral replacement, but existing treatments often require multiple doses. In this first study, we compared iron sucrose with ferric caroxymaltosese in patients with low levels of ferriin concentration. The primary safety endpoint was all-caluse mortality, nonfatals myocardia infamy rcticion, congesive heart failure, arrhythmies and hyper-and hypotensives. This study compares the efficaciousness of single-ddose Ferric Caroxymoltose to iron surose in treating fatigue during premenopause. Fatigue decreases during the initial six weeks by 1. In the iron group than 0.7 inthe placebo group P =.0007."
26717446,"This is a prospective, observational study of the effects of either diet alone or diet with an inhibitor of stomach absorption on obese women. The subjects were divided into two groups: one group was assigned according to the Type of intervention; the other group included women who had received orlistate as well as hypocalorous diet. After six months, the patients were measured in terms of body weight, body mass-index, waistcircference, and fat mass. In this study, we examined the effect of different types of weight loss regimens on blood pressure, anthropomorphometric parameters, viscerally fat, insulin resistance, homeostassisis model evaluation of insulin resistin levels, C-Reactive Protein, glutathone peroxidese and isopropstane. We also studied the impact of three different weight reduction regimen's for leptine levels in obese ladies. Twenty-five obese females were assigned to either 1) or 2) exercise-induced weigh loss -- OWL -- n=8, 3) or ""orlistat plus EWL"" -- after 16 weeks. They were then compared with those who did not receive either treatment. Their mean age was 45 + / 9.0 years and mean BMI was 36.4. Thirties hypertensives were selected from 18 to 55 years old and were asked to receive 1,400Kcal/day food plus vitamin E 800 IU daily with orwithout oristat. These subjects completed the study. Forty-three overweight subjects with biopsy proven Nonalcoholic Steatohepatis were remized to receiving 3,000 Kcal day diet plus vitamine E800 iu ) daily without ortaxat, 120mg three times daily at week 36"
29776983,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective study on patients with late infection after total hip surgery. We compare the risk factors for early infection in patients who had received conventional or robot-advised total knee replacements and those who did not have an infection during their followup period. The aim of this study is to prospectively compare outcomes and complications of both surgical and non-surgical approaches to determine whether the new technology can be used to improve patient outcome. Acrobot milling has been shown to be more effective than manual arthrostry in reducing bone loss. This study also focuses on improving the accuracy of the short stem placement in total shoulder reamment."
24123139,"This paper describes the development of a new, validated motor function measure for measuring the impact of muscular disease. It is based on an observational study of 100 patients with suspected and confirmed Duchenne Muskellunge disease in Nice, France between 2005 and 2007. The aim of this study is to establish the reliability of the motor functions measure in determining the severity and progressionof neuromuscular disease as well as the need for mechanical venturing. In this paper, we describe solitary myosis caused by ""sporadicclusion body myostis"" and its treatment using IVIG. A multi-clinic, collaborative study was designed to evaluate the natural progress andefficacy of treatment for Duchesenne muscular Dytrophy."
30338697,"This paper focuses on the use of patient reported outcome measures to assess ankle pain. It is hypothesizes that frequently used proms have early ceiling and floor effects, which are important for evaluating patients' health status. The authors conclude that self-assessed symptoms and functional status questions are more sensitive to clinical improvement in patients after carpal bundling than traditional physical assessment measures of strength or sensibility. In this study, we examine the relative response to change of general versus disease specific and unweigheded severity scores in carpel tunnel syndrome. A prospective cohort study was conducted among 8,714 patients with hip impairments who were receiving treatment in 31 states from January 2005 to June 2007. We examined the relationships between preoperative Patient-Reported Outcome Measures, Physical Function Item Bank v1, Pain interference and Depression Scores. These values were calculated using a Body-part-Specific Computerized Adaptive test."
28542867,"In this study, we examine changes in motor control between a sixteen-week period of active video game use and 16 weeks of usual activities. We compare the child's perceptions of physical performance between AVG and Non-Aggressive conditions. Twenty-one children were confirmed at risk of developing developmental coordination disorder by being assigned to either conventional neurological treatment or ommed and controlled trial. The purpose is to evaluate the effect of conventional neurological treatment and an exercise program on eyesh and coordination for children with spatic diplegicia. All children score below the 16 percentile on one standing test of motor abilities and balance skills. Both groups improve on all tests; both groups have significantly improved on their motor proficiency scores. This study was designed to assess the reliability and deterministic validity of the ""American Academy forcerebral palsy and demental medicine"" methodology for conducting single-blinded studies. Four clinicians evaluated 24 articles for quality and reliability using AAcDM methodology. They also examined the efficaciousness of Wii Fit training on motor function in children who had spastic brain injuries. Children with cerebral palspisity were divided into two groups: 1) Neuromotor task training 2) Nintendo wii fit training 3) and another 50 children served as controls. After five weeks without intervention, no significant differences were observed between testing occasion for any of these balance measures investigated. Brain injury patients often undergo acute rehabilitation after head injury. These studies aim to compare different types of therapy used to improve motor performance in adults and children. Although there are limited evidence available regarding the effectiveness of such devices, it is clear that they can be used effectively in improving motor skills and behavior in young children suffering from developmental delay."
22820555,"In this study, we examine the efficaciousness of a novel sleep-promoting drug, modafil, in treating patients with mild to moderate psychosis. The effects of 200mgmodafinil are modest and have no significant effect on executive function or memory. Modavirl is also shown to improve neuropsychological tasks in healthy volunteers as well as adults with attention deficit disorder. We conclude that it is possible that modalfinill may be useful in the first few weeks of an episode of schizophrenia when symptoms are malleable."
24723255,"In this study, we examine the effects of a combination of Lactobacterium acidophilus and Bfidobacillus on infants who are very low birth-weight. The results indicate that both groups have significant reductions in the risk of developing necrotizing Enterocolitis when compared to control groups. A double blinded, placebo-control study was conducted on 231 premild babies weighed from 750 up to 1499g at birth. This study showed that probiotic use had little effect on the incidence of Necterizing enterocotis in preterm children. However, there were some reports that it was more effective for early-onset disease to be treated with probiota than by feeding alone. We conclude that these studies suggest that using Probiotics may reduce the severity of neonates' nosocomic infections."
17394228,"This paper focuses on the relationship between a general health status measure, the Nottingham Health Profile, and the clinical changes in the European core data set of RA. Two hundred patients with relapsed rhumatood arthritis were recruited. They had mean age 58. 9 yr; mean disease duration 11  years. The Functional assessment of chronic Illness-therapy Fatigue scale was used along with other measures previously validated in arthritis. In this study, we examine the effects of low- impact exercise on fatigue as well as disease activity. We report that subjects who received more frequently reported reduced fatigue while those who did not reported an increasein fatigue. A double blinded crossover trial compares the antiinflammatory effect of analgesia and tolerabilityof diclofennac sodium Voltaren or ibupropen. Thirty outpatients with both types of pain were included. After treatment, no differences were seen in their quality of life after the intervention."
28743192,"This is a small, cross-sectional study comparing the effects of an eight-week intervention on obesity in African American and Latino children. The results suggest that diets with high fiber and sugar content may be effective for weight loss. In addition, this study suggests that interdisciplinary approaches can be used to improve blood levels of glucosin, phosphorus, and other important inflammatory markers in obese children as well."
27837440,"African Americans suffer from disproportionately high blood pressure and complications, but few studies have focused on improving their control. There is little evidence of a combined approach to care for patients with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. A nurse case manager was assigned as the primary care provider in this study. The intervention consisted of monthly self-care support and quarter-month medication management facilitations. In addition, the intervention improved changes in blood sugar concentrations, haemologlobin levels, and lipoprotein content over 12 months. Latinos who had Type 2, or ""t2D,"" face major health access and diseasemanagement disparities. They receive usual care; an intense diet intervention; pedometer driven activity; and daily physical activity. At three years' follow-up, no differences in results are found between the two treatment groups. This study evaluates the efficaciousness of ongoing group-based diabetes self manage education for type 2 patients. Although there were no significant differences at six months after the start of the study, it was concluded that the program was effective in helping patients reduce fat consumption and increase lifestyle physical exercise levels. It was furthermore examined whether the effectiveness of telephone call-retrieval by practice nurses could be extended to patients without additional training."
27623982,"The effect of the prebiotic freezed dried powdered inulin type fructans on glucose, lipidmetabolism, and intestinal transit was investigated in elderly people. In this paper, we examine the relationship between cholesterol reductions and total mortality rates and the risk of heart disease in patients with high-risk background. We also investigate whether early gut composition can guide fat loss throughout early childhood. Children were selected from an international obesity task force as well as maternal age, body mass index, mode of birth, probiotic supply, duration of breasting, use of antigens during infiection, frequency of atopy diseases and sensitivity to sensitization. Early bowel microbiotastic composition was examined by fluorescent insite hybridization with micronic and flow cynography detection and by quantimetric real-time Polymerase Chain reaction. This study is designed to assess the effects of short chain fructooligusaccharide on blood glucose concentrations, lipoprotein content, triacylglucerol concentration; it is further studied in Type 2 diabetes. It is concluded that adding short chains of fiber to food may reduce fasting blood levels and improve insulin resistance in healthy subjects. However, there is no evidence for any beneficial effect on atherosculosis. A low-fat meal has been suggested as preventing atheroclerosis because it lowers plasmacholesterol but does not increase faster blood glyciacemia or serum total cholesterolconcentrations. Fructoolics have been used to lower fastening glibness and serum alcholestrol concentrates. These studies are followed by two doubleblind crossover studies: first, eight healthy men receive either gluttonous feed or sucrose over four weeks; second, twenty-two young male volunteers receive both placebo or long-chain fructogenes respectively. They are then divided into two groups: one group receives ""pillow-enriched"" cookies while the other controls ""control cookie."" After eating these cookies, the subjects rate their feelings of hunger and cardiovascular risk factor. For example, they score higher than control cookies when they are eaten alone. Another study compares consumption of foods with known hypocholsteric properties such as propionate and SDAFFACH which have proven effective in reducing elevated LDL level. Finally, another study evaluates the efficaciousness of combination of diets with recognized cholesterollowering properties"
11687163,"A study is performed to evaluate whether the medical literature is misleading as result of a combination of selective published trials and results showing significant treatment effect. In this study, 25 patients with spasm-prone spondies were followed for three years after an intense course of physical therapy. They reported improved pain severity, stiffness intensity, and function during the initial course but did not report any changes in pain or stiffening at the end of the course. The effects of unsupervised exercise on pain was studied in 105 patients who had ankylosizing sternoid disease. Sixteen patients received experimental treatment and 19 received control treatment. Long-term improvements were observed in spinal mobility, vital capacity, fitness, health assessment, patient'sglobal health score, finger tip-to- floor distance. Cost effectiveness was examined in terms of cost per patient. This study showed that home-based exercises were more effective than conventional exercises in improving symptoms of anaklosing stench."
32307935,"This is a first-in-man study to determine whether the levels of vitamin D are associated with symptoms of menopause. The results suggest that there is an association between 25-hydroxyvitamine D levels and overall number of womenopausals, but this effect is not clinically significant. A second study investigates the effects of daily doses of either calcium or vitaminD on vaginal growth and dryness. In this study, we examine the efficacy of two different forms of treatment: 1) long-term transdermal replacement therapy; and 2) short- term depressant treatments. We conclude that these studies have important potential applications in the early postmenopalausal period."
32152747,"The aim of this study is to compare the results of total knee surgery with that of a parapatellarian approach. In this case, patients are assigned either sturdy or conventional approaches and follow-up studies are performed on each patient. A significant increase in blood loss occurs in the mini-meditally invasive approach; however, there is no difference in range of motion at any time during the follow up period. This study also focuses on the effect of Patella Eversion on functional outcome measures in patients who undergo complete knee arthrosis. It was found that the patellar approach resulted in less pain for patients but more rapid recovery from straight leg raise than the traditional medial Parapatascar Approach. Furthermore, it showed that both groups had improved their performance after two years of post-opsiemization."
25031196,"This study focuses on the relationship between knee load and the outcome of patients with knee osteoartritis. It is a prospective, observational study that compares the effects of two different types of insoled shoes on knee pain. The first type has been shown to improve symptoms while the second has only been found to reduce the risk of disease progression. In this study, we examine the effect of three-dimension gait analysis on changes in knee joints after weight loss over 16 weeks in people with severe knee or hip osteoarthrits."
29317216,"In this paper, we examine the effects of auditory-sensical information on a visual task and relate it to the performance of children with autistic disorder. We also discuss the role of the social response scale in predicting the severity of an individual's response to certain stimuli."
30154381,"In this study, we examine the association between blood levels of 25 hydroxyvindal and C-Reactive Protein in a population-based cohort. We use genetic variants to predict risk for Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. This study is designed to find out whether patients with hypovitaminiosis have increased insulin resistance. It is aimed at finding out how individuals with pridiabetes are affected by their vitamin D status and to determine the relationship between these two factors. The results suggest that there may be an indirect effect of low-25Hydrexvitamin D on type 2 disease."
31582860,"In this study, we examine the effects of conjugated lipoprotein acid on body composition in a group of overweight patients with high risk of heart disease. After 1 week, 42 subjects were assigned to either CLA groups or placebo-controlled trials. The safety and efficacy of the studies were not evaluated. All subjects received 3.4 gram Cla/d in each trigllyceride form. Circulation lipostocytes and thrombrocyte levels increased in all men. There was little change in fast blood glucose. Conjugatd lioleic Acid is shown to reduce atheroscy in animals but has not been studied in humans. This study investigates the effect of conjugated Linolesic Acid on immune function in healthy humans by comparing the doses of different types of caduceus alphonse that have been used for antitumorous purposes."
21146772,"This paper describes a workplace health promotion program that is designed to improve cardiovascular disease risk factor factors. Its primary outcome is the percentage of employees meeting the recommended amount of physical activity. The study also examines the effects of stretching and rest breaks on workers' performance. In addition, it shows that teachers use active lessons more frequently in order to achieve greater student results. A school-based Physical Activity Against the Curriculum intervention is used to determine whether increasing amounts of moderate-intensity exercise will reduce gains in Body Mass Index. Both groups show significant improvements in students' physical activities. However, there are still some concerns about the appropriateness of exercises in the classroom. For example, children who do not participate in recess tend to be less physically active than those who engage in other forms of exercise. Although many studies have examined the effect of walking or jumping on bone mineral content, few have attempted to apply these principles to children's lives. Thus, this study uses omization as an opportunity to evaluate the effcacy of pedometer-like exercises for improving body mass index."
25271203,"This study focuses on the effects of postural difficulty on quiet posture in subjects with low-back pain. It compares the changes in posture during one-footed or externally disturbed stance between healthy subjects and patients who have chronic back pain, as well as those who do not have pain but are depressed by it. A cross sectional study is performed to determine whether there is a relationship between body balance and spinal perturbation in patients with high back problems. The results show that there seems to be an association between spine perturbations and poor control of motor control in both groups. In this study, we examine the effect of two-handed tasking on posturoception in people with no backpain. We find that these tasks are associated with lower trend in Anteropostrophar and Mediolatéral directions in individuals with LBP than in healthy participants."
20482475,"This study focuses on the effects of combined endurance and muscular strength training on patients with chronic, heart failure. It is shown that exercise training can improve both physical and mental health in these patients. In particular, it has been reported that resistance training may be more effective than other forms of exercise for improving central hemodynamics in patients who have congestive-heart failure because of the potential for an increase in peak oxygen consumption. However, there is little evidence regarding the effect this type of training has on quality of life or function among patients suffering from heart failing."
19508728,"This study focuses on the effects of a two year early intervention pilot program for back injured nurses. The aim is to determine whether this program can reduce the incidence, morbidness, time lost, and cost due an injury in the 250 nursed wards employed at ten target high-risk subjects. Injuries are tracked continuously until return to normal work. A psychological return-to-work focused program has been used to treat patients with sub acute back pain. It was found that patients who had long-term sick leave were less likely to recover from their injuries than those who did not have them. An exercise program was also shown to improve the rate of return after six months. Another study was performed to assess the efficiacy of multimodal cognitive behavior treatment for patients suffering from chronic lowback pain: grade d activities were more effective than usual care in treating these patients."
28627214,"In this study, we examine the effect that green tea extract can have on body weight. It has been reported that it can increase energy expenditure and improve fat burning in humans. The results of this trial are as follows: subjects receive a high content of green-tea extract at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. After three days, they consume either 378mg or placebo. They show resemblances between the effects of both treatments. A double blind, placebo-control study is performed to investigate the influence of Green Tea Extract on Body Composition and Fat Distribution in Overly Obeyed Thais. Forty six obese patients were assigned to receive 3,79ml of GTE or no placebo for 12 weeks. This study compares the changes in body composition after two months of treatment with those of control groups. There was no difference in any of their hormone levels measured before or after treatment. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in all of the biochemical and bodily measures measured prior to and aftertreatment in either group. These results suggest that consumption of red tea may be beneficial for weight control."
21690453,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of weight loss after gastric bypass in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The results are very similar to those obtained after laparooscopic adjustable gastrinb and a high-fat diet. He concludes by stating that it is not possible to predict long-term health consequences from these results. However, his study does suggest that ""low-energy"" diets can be used to prevent or delay excessive weight gain. Anderson then proceeds to describe the use of an energy-restricted low-carrying diet for treating obesity. This treatment has been shown to improve blood glucose control in type 2 diabetism. Although many patients fail to recover after the operation, there is some evidence that this treatment can reduce their risk of complications."
23913339,"In this study, the authors describe a method for determining cup-migration in patients with hips that have been implanted with porous tantalum. They report that after eight years of follow-up, they have seen an average increase in cup size from 1 to 2 mm. The results of this new technique are described in this paper. For example, over nine years, there has been no significant change in cups from one cup to another. This is due to the fact that many of the cups have already been replaced by other patients."
23337783,"This paper describes a new approach to reporting evidence in the medical community. It uses an observational longitudinal study to determine whether or not patients receive better care after traumatic fracture and how it compares to routine care. The authors present ten studies that describe the use of observationals as ancillary tools for evaluating patient outcome. These studies include: 1) A prospective, open-ended analysis of the effect of physician education on hip fracture treatment; 2) A case manager intervention designed to increase the rate of appropriate treatment within six months of hip brokenness; 3) A comparison of usual care and ""case manager"" intervention; and 4) A Markov decisionanalytic evaluation of cost-effectiveity of this intervention over time."
30787096,"In this prospective, omization-controlled study, patients with shoulder pain who have difficulty returning to normal activities are compared between the Danish version ""Disabilitys of the Arm"" and the English Shoulder Score. This is the first time that such a measure has been used to assess patient responsiveness in shoulder patients. The results of this study indicate that the minimal clinically important change in the modified constant score can be as low as 0.5 points. A comparison of these two measures is made using an anchor-based method which uses mean changes in scores to calculate the significance of each change."
30799194,"In this study, Wu et al. investigates the association between dietary habits and total mortality in Chinese women. The Shanghai Women's health study is a cohort-based study of 73,942 females age 40 to70 years at the start of recruitment. This population-base study collects detailed  diet information using validate d, quantitative foodfrequency question naire. It was divided into six groups: 1, 2, 3 g of Cinnamon daily; 2 p.m. or 4 pp. per capsule; and 6 h. placebo capsules. There were no significant differences in blood glucose levels among patients with Type 2 diabetes. A double blind, randomed placebo-controlled study was conducted on 60 patients who had type 2 disease. They were divided according to their BMI. After two months, they were assigned either one gram of cinnamon or another. Their results were mixed. Both groups showed marked improvement in fasting blood pressure, body massindex, and waist circumference. Furthermore, both groups improved Hba1c values significantly. These results suggest that these changes are not related to other risk factors for heart attack."
21059667,"A prospective, randomed controlled study is designed to determine whether preoperative chest exercise affects the risk of post-operative complications in patients scheduled for major artery surgery. In this study, we assess the effects of short term pulmonary rehabilitation and compare it to moderate continuous training on peak oxygen uptake at two different timepoints. The results suggest that short-term physical therapy can improve quality of life in heart failure patients who undergo elective resection. Preoperative education and exercises are especially important in these patients because they may lead to delayed recovery."
22437353,"In this study, we compare the results of a six-month follow-up period after mitral and biatrial maze surgery with that of patients who had permanent atrial fillation. The outcome was improved by antiarrhythmical medication. All patients were treated with warfarin. A prospective iv/omized study compared patients with atrium fibrillation of more than six months duration after Mitral Valve surgery plus Biatary Modified Radiofrequency Maze Procedure using Medtronically Cardioblate system. After 6 months, all patients received war farin; in both groups, sinus rhythm restoration was achieved by intra-and postoperative DC heartversion and classIII antiarctic medication as required. Both groups received epicardial cryoablations for their primary endpoints: regaind sinus rythme and restored left ventricles. This study also examines the use of ""salineirrigated cooled tip"" ablation to treat permanent arrhythmian fibrilation in patients under open heart surgery. It is reported that it has been used successfully for treatment of permanent convalescent attrition. However, there are no reports of its efficaciousness in treating permanent or chronic attributable disease."

Aim Atrial highrate events are defined as an acute episode that lasts more than 24 hours and can lead to stroke. The aim of this study is to determine whether pacemakers or heart failure devices can predict the severity of strokes in real time. This study uses a novel algorithm to predict stroke risk from home-monitoring technology."
26180255,"The effect of calcium-Vitamin D on hip fractures is compared with that of a placebo-controlled, double blinded trial. In this study, the effects of two different types of vitamin D regimens on parathyroid functions are investigated. One group receives 1,200 mg of dailycalcium and the other 1,800 mg/d each; both groups have similar results. This study determines whether or not high levels of Vitamin D in the blood lead to Type 2 diabetes. It also examines changes in body mass and fat in older women. There are significant Age-related declines in Fat Mass and Body Composition as well as increases in Total Body Fat, Percent Body Mass, and Fat-free Mass. Cautionary Ergocaliferol does not seem to prevent falls in elderly women living in sun climates. However, it has been uncertain whether it will work in patients who live in community in sunnyclimates where there are many risk factors for falling. A possible role deficion in contributing to winter increase in heart disease is investigated by testing its effect on blood pressure during winter."

The aim is to determine whether weight loss, combined with improved quality of life, can reduce the risk of heart disease. In this study, we examine the change in body mass at one year after bariatic surgery in patients with morbidly obesity. We conclude that it is not possible to predict the future risk from these changes because there is no evidence of long-term effect."
29718689,"In a two-year study, overweight adults with Type 2 Diabetes lose weight and improve their blood pressure. The results are similar in terms of weight loss and improvement in other measures of health. A Mediterranean diet has been used to treat type 2 diabetes but little is known about its efficacy. This study compares the effects of low-carbidohydrate diet on body fat and gycemic control among overweight people who have type 1 or 2 disease. It was found that high-monunstained fat diets were better at reducing blood flow than high carbohidrate diet's. However, this study did not find any significant differences between the two groups."
31367297,"In this study, we examine the effect that ezetimbe and simva statin can have on oxidation stress in patients who have Type 2 diabetes. We compare the effects with placebo on six markers of oxative stress: 1) lipoprotein concentration, 2) lipid peroxicity, 3) antioxidant activity, and 4) endotheal function. The results are mixed. Simvastain reduces blood concentration ofcholesterol by inhibiting HMG-Glutaryl-CoenzymeA reducitase, which is responsible for cholesterol synthesis. These results lead to an increase in taurine concentration throughout the therapy. This study also investigates the relationship between Pon1 activities, hypercholestrolemia, or antioxidant enzymes among patients with non-alcoholicfatty liver disease. It was found that there was no difference in the amount of taurine concentration in either group. A further study was performed on 50 patients without nichospheric disease; 20 patients were assigned to either treatment alone or two different regimens. Twenty-three patients received atorvarstatin in individual adjusted dosages once daily for 12 weeks. Thirty patients had type 2 diabetimic Egyptians with or without Nephropathy. They were treated with both types of medicine. After three days of treatment, LDL reduced by 11.9 percent with a subsequent decrease to 29"
24977635,"The aim of this study is to determine whether epidural Anesthesia and Post-Opiatry reduce the incidence of fatal complications after colorecian surgery under controlled postopatra care. Thirteen patients with colonic cancer were assigned to either patient-controlled Analgesis with Intrvenous Morphine or Epidual AnalsiA with a mixed mixture of fentannyl and bupivivacaine. In general, there was little difference between the severity of pain and the length of recovery in both groups. Acute hip surgery for fractures was performed under spinal anaemia without general anesthesia. There was only one patient who died from causes not related to the anamnesis; two patients had brady heart disease and hypotension. Forty older patients undergoing acute major abdominal surgery were given atr and Omly either spinal Anaesthesia with Bicuvacine 0.75 %) or general Anestical With Diazepum, Fentanly, and N 2O/O2, respectively. Mortality did not differ between groups but they were shorter than expected. No persistent improvement in mental function occurred after acute hip surgeries under Spinal Antenions: no persistent impairment in mentally function was found After acute knee surgery Under Spinary Anthropose. The efficacious and sideeffects of post-operative analga with three pain regimens were studied in ninety patients during major abdominal surgery. For elderly patients, it was important to see how the type of anisthetic administered effects per-and-postoperative morbidities and mortality as well as the duration of hospitalization. It was vitally important that we see if different types of ansesthetic administration affects blood loss, volume replacement, etc. As long as these patients are treated according to their pre-existing medical conditions, they should be treated appropriately."

In this study, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either a double blinded treatment or placebo. The results revealed significant improvements in both parent and teacher's satisfaction with their treatment. Children also reported improved health-related qualities of life than those receiving active medication. A multi-site controlled study was conducted among adolescents with Attention Deficits/Hyteractivity Disorder. Adolescences were rand Omized for two weeks to identify doses of OroS methylphini date that increased symptoms to predetermined criteria. Subjects completed the dose TTration phase; they tolerated and replied to the protocol. Treatment efficacy was measured by investigator, parent assessment, and adult assessment of ADHD. Meta-analysis showed that combined treatment did not result in superior functioning but continued over two years. Furthermore, all treatments failed to lead to superior function. However, there was improvement across all trials and continued until 2 years after completion. Another study examined the safety of dexmethylphenidate extended release as compared to other stimulants in children who had attention-defiant/hyperactivité disorder: ADHD. It was found that patients responded better when titrated to either fast or slow dosing intervals. Both groups maintained benefit during the acute period.

22574624,"The aim of this study is to determine whether a daily iron-folic acid regimen can prevent the overgrowth of children who have epilepsy. In this trial, 267 children with anemia were divided into 5 groups and given either one or two different treatments. Iron content was 20 g/ml, iron+foliic acid supplement, Ifs, Mms; multiplemicronutrient supplements were mixed up in porridge powder, FCF & FW respectively. Hematogloin concentrations were measured at base and after four months of treatment. A double blinded crossover test of folate and placebo was performed in children aged 6 to 15 years who had been on PHT for more than six months. They were excluded because they had preexisting bleeding problems, use other folicid antagonists such as leucochovorin, or Maccytic Anemia. This study investigated the effects of additional folic acid and vitamin B12 on mental retardation among Down's Syndrome patients. All infants initially received iron and iron according to accepted standards but were then assigned to receive either 1, 2, or 3 doses of each type of intervention. After 12 months, all babies were treated with either 3, 4, or 5 milligrams per day. These results were not statistically significant except for the effect of blood pressure reduction when compared to controls. Furthermore, these studies showed that hyperhomocousysteinemia may be associated with cardiovascular disease and hypochondriacal disease. To assess whether antioxidants, fulvic acid, nor both improve the psychomotor performance of sick children, we conducted twelfth-year-olds with trisomies living in the midland and south west of England. Children were fed breast-fed or formula- feedted with adequate amounts of food. No differences were found in haemologlobin levels, haevamogroin level, weight, and length between control and nonsupplemented subjects. There was no significant difference in mean red cell folation levels between those who received maloprim vs chlorproguannyil or placebo. Endotothelial functions were studied in Type 1 diabetesmellitus by means of endothelal function. Folate increases both serum and Red cell Follate levels and saturation is also increased. Thus, there is no association between the anticonvulsion action of pyreth"

The first group receives no antibiotics; the second group is given only one pre-operative dosage of metirondazole 10mg/kg. This group has a significantly lower rate of infection than the third group. After an emergency apppendicectomy, patients are randomed to receive either placebo or prophylactic antimicrobials after 7 days of outpatient treatment. Wound wound irrigation with 1 percent cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide was not effective in preventing post-operation wound infection. A doubleblind, placebo controlled trial of short-lived metronidrazle spreads against postoperated wound infections was performed. No significant differences were found between the treated as well as control groups: ""There was no significant change in the incidence nor severity of wound contamination betweenthe treated and control subjects.""

32225172,"Oropharynic priming after birth in premature infants has been shown to improve weight gain andmodification of theoral immunomicrobial environments. In this study, we examine the effects of octopically-administered probiotics against ventilator- associated pneumonia in preterm newborns. We conclude that orophatoryngeal treatment will reduce the risk of developing ventilater-associated pneumonia by reducing the severity of disease attributable to the use of procotinous feeding. A prospective, open-lated, rand and omezed controlled trial is performed to determine whether or not OAC can be used as an anti-venture-related pneumonia preventive measure. The efficacy of either regimen was found to be superior to placebo in terms of reduction of mortality and length of stay."
29341831,"The aim of this study is to determine whether or not a single-dose morphine can be used as an effective treatment for patients with monoclonic gammopathies. In the first phase of the trial, 54 patients were treated with zoleldronic acid 4mg iv. At 0 and 6 months, their bone mineral density was assessed using double-energy x-ray absorptionsorptometry scans in thelumbar spine done at screening; at 13 months after the final soliloquy, they were able to assess their results. The MedicalResearch CouncilMyelompa IX trial examined traditional and conventional regimens followed by IV zoedronic alchemy. Osteopenia and osteoporoseis were also studied. Overall survival had been similar between the groups. A safety study was performed on thalidide and zealous phosphonates in patients who received maintenance therapy. Both showed no significant differences in overall survival. However, there were imbalances between group with respect to risk characteristics. This study investigates the effect of bisphosphoenates on clinical outcomes in newly diagnosed multiplemyelloma. It was found that basphosphorylated agents reduced the risk of disease but did not increase the rate of recovery."

He uses rand and ommized blinded, double-barred, parallel-over study to determine whether or not it can be used to treat patients with spina bashidas. This is an open-label, two-part trial in 15 men aged 19 to 35 year old with spinal cord injury who are assigned to take four sets of tablet, 5 tablet per set. The first part was designed to assess the efficiacy and safety by taking one dose of Sildenaf 50mg or placebo over 28 days. Part II examined the effects of single doses of Sildennasol on penile stiffness. After completing all three parts, the results of goal-directed therapy were compared among 460 patients from September 1991 until March 1995. Short- term and long-time results were obtained; patients preferred medical treatments but satisfaction was highest with surgery. A further study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of alprosteadil in treating recurrent earthroaches in men suffering from various causes: organic, psychogenic, mixed causes."
23190278,"The survival rates for tooth restorations are calculated after examining patients' dental records. In the first three trials, the survival rate was higher than that of other material treatments. For crowns, amalgam, composite resin, or glass ioonomer, there was a significant difference in the success rate. A fourth study is presented which compares the performance of different restorative materials to amalgam in primary teeth. This paper reviews three published papers on the use of these new and improved materials in treating children and adolescents. It also discusses how the clinicians select the best material for each patient. All studies had practice-based design; the surgeons were assigned what material s should use in r and Omised matter. After four years, they were free to choose the most appropriate material. Results and Conclusions: Resinmod glass IonOmer RMGI and compo Mer showed similar longevity as AM, while conventional GI restores showed considerably shorter survival time. Purpose The objective of this clinical trial was to examine the effectiveness of traumatic restourative treatment -- Art -- in primary morals. To evaluate the efficacy of two different types of glass cements with the ""Atraumatic Restoration"" technique in permanent dentition. Both cement groups have good results. However, both cement methods cause pain during caries treatment. These studies suggest that an ART approach may be more comfortable for older adults because it involves less trauma."
23937401,"In this study, we examine the strength and sealability of glass fiber-posts in combination with a cement that is both strong and light-binding. We conclude that these posts are superior to gold-alloy-based posts because they can be used as cores or postecs without losing any tooth structure. This paper also discusses the use of different types of cements for bonding endodontic crowns. It shows that there are two kinds of glues available: 1) glassfiber-reinforced posts; and 2) single-rooted posts. The first is an epoxy resin material called GFREP, which is more flexible than either of these materials."
30823873,"This study focuses on the validity of a question-naire that measures lifetime physical activity in older adults. It is based on self-reports and does not depend on recall. The main purpose of this paper is to compare the reliability of the VAPAQ, which was originally designed as an interviewer administered by the World health organization, with the original approach of asking subjects directly. A sample of 112 patients who met the pre-wear time requirements were included in this study. In addition, the results of detraining after strength training are examined in patients with recent-onset arthritis. After six months, they returned to their previous physical activities; at baseline, there was no significant change in the shape or force-time curvature of all muscles groups. Physical activity assessment has been difficult because it relies on repeating questions over several weeks. However, one survey, called the Modifiability Activity Question Observation, uses both self administration and interviewers to assess past-year exercise performance."
27820218,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of group-based education on patients with type two diabetes. He describes a five-year controlled trial in which all patients were assigned to either groups or individual care. After six months, only one patient dropped out of the study. This is an important issue because there are still many studies that have not been done regarding the efficacy and cost of treating Type 2 patients. Anderson concludes by stating that it is necessary to develop new approaches to treatment for patients who do not yet have adequate access to medicine. For example, ""Group Care"" is used to treat Type 2, non-insuline-treated patients as well as those who have severe complications. The results of this study suggest that group care may be more effective than individual management."
22005864,"A double-blinded trial compares cruciate bearing knee replacements with posterior-strummed knee arthropys. The results show no significant differences between the two types of prostheses, but there is no difference in range of motion or pain during the first year after surgery. A prospective i v r and Omized study examines the long- term survival of patients who receive cemented or cementless fixes for total kneearthroplasty. In this study, we assess the effect of fixed bearing on knee resurfacing. There are no major differences among the patient groups regarding age, body mass, and severity of arthritis. This study also evaluates several different means of fixating tibially components during total hip arthrostry. We conclude that all knees are implanted to either hysterical bearing or rigid bearing. Both methods improve knee function and recovery. However, they do not result in improvement in knee performance over time."
30017172,"In this study, we examine the effects of two different forms of reveratrol on Type 2 diabetics. The first group receives a placebo-controlled intervention and the second group is given randolous treatment. After nineteen patients are assigned into two separate groups, one receiving pAkt ratio and another receiving placebo. A total of 19 patients were randomly assigned to either group. Before they began the trial, their blood chemistry was examined; before and after thesecond and fourth weeks, insulin resistance orsensitivity, Creinine-Normalized Ortho-tyramine level in Urine sample s, as if oxidative stresses were measured, incretn levels and phosphaterylated protein B kinases B:protein kinsaseB:Akt Rat ratio in platelet were assessed and calculated. At the fourth week, reasverate significantly reduced insulin resistors and urinary excretion while it increased phosphorylation at platelets. This study investigates the protective role of alcohol in myocartal ischemia-reperfusion injury. rats were exposed to both types of infection. Both groups showed improved cardiac function, reduced inflammation, and reduced malondialdesehyde levels. These studies also investigated whether drinking renseratable grape extract could improve the efficiacy of lifestyle changes in patients with coronarry artery disease. We investigated dosage-dependent effects upon stable patients treated according to now accepted guideline for secondary preventance of cardiovascular disease."" Methods In three-blind double blinded, quadriatic pilot clinical trial where 75 stable adults received 350mg / day of placebo, red wine polyphenol plus 8 mg repverratrol or conventional grape Extract lacking Resversatlor during six months. Biomarkers were then analyzed. Heuristic analysis was performed using moarrays"
22354262,"This is a prospective, sfolk-based study to investigate the effects of an anti-angiotensine-converting enzyme blocker on mean blood pressure and cerebral blood flow in hypertensesive stroke patients. Twenty-four untreated patients were randomized to receive 4mg perindoprim every day or placebo for fourteen days. The results showed that peridopril had pronounced effects on both mean arterial blood force, central and glomerulular filtration rates. In addition, it was shown that this drug reduced the relapse of stroke in patients with severe internal carocid arteries. A double-blinded, placebo-control study was performed to determine whether angiotin-conversion inhibitor such as pedigopil could be used as hepardy preventive therapy in post-stroke patients who have moderate to severe inner carotidian artery disease."
19370593,"The Women's health initiative trial of combined equin estrogens was stopped early due to an increased stroke risk and no reduction on risk of heart disease. In this paper, the authors describe the results of their breast-cancer risk assessment and compare the effects of conjugated Equine Estrogen with placebo in women who had begun menopause. They conclude that use of progestiners may reduce risks of chest disease, stroke, and total death. However, they do not find any overall reduction in rate of coronary Heart Disease among postpausal females with CHD. This is because there is little evidence for the effect of these two regimens on cardiovascular outcome. Although statins are well known for their anti-angiographic effects, little is known about how they affect mammography. Mammograms have been measured in many different studies. Estradiol has been shown to improve short-delayed verbal recall by older women with mildly impaired brain function. These studies also suggest that using progesterinates might prevent lung cancer from developing."
30926250,"The purpose of the present study is to determine whether or not a comprehensive gaeriatric assessment can predict long-term survival in elderly patients. We assess the association between Geriatri assessment results and severe disease toxicity after first cycle of drug therapy in older patients who have diffuse large B cell lungoma. In this study, we evaluate the use of an extended geriatry assessment as compared to standard measures for prediction of mortality in old patients with cancer. A prospective observational study examines the effect of nursing case management on treatment of older breastcancer patients; it was found that nurses were more effective than advanced practice nurses in reducing the risk of complications during surgery."
28831565,"In this paper, we describe the results of a novel endoscopic inguinal Hernia procedure. We compare the efficacy of laparoscopic or tension-free methods for hernism and conclude that they are superior to conventional open techniques. This study is designed to evaluate the role of proinflammatory mediators after Lichtenstein tension free herinioplasty using polypropelene prosthetic materials or Bassiny hernial repair. It was found that patients with LH showed higher levels of fibringen, alpha1-antitryppin, and interloquyn-6 than those with BH. The objective here is to determine the most appropriate treatment of indicated hernesius. A prospective multi-centre trial has been performed between 1992 and 1998 on 181 eligible men with primary or first time recurrent shenians. Both methods have been used successfully in trials but have not been evaluated by objective parameters. These studies suggest that either technique should be used when there is an urgent need for pain relief. However, these studies do not show any significant differences in duration, pain severity, time to recover, cost, or systemic inflammation. Although many surgeons still perform suture repairs, it is difficult to find out how effective this technique is in terms of long-term results."
31664495,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates the efficacy of an eight-year-old patient-adherence program to improve postoperative outcome for patients with coloncancer. This study compares the benefits of improved recovery after surgery with conventional care in patients treated with open colectomy and laparoscopic coloanal reseccts. A fast track clinical pathway is designed to reduce length of stay and hospital costs for many surgical procedure. The aim was to develop a reliable and valid checklist for evaluating both pre- and post-elective procedures for colon cancer. It was developed using evidence-based methods and validated by three experienced reviewsers. After two years, the program has been used in over 1,500 patients. Costeffectiveness studies are performed on all patients who undergo elective color cenectomy."
20078374,"Caffeine increases blood pressure, but the relationship between habitual drinking of caffeinate beverages and incident hypotension is uncertain. In this study, we examine the effects of artificial sweetness on glucose, insulin, and glutagon- like peptide in humans. The subjects drink either diet soda or high- fructose corn Syrup for three weeks to improve weight loss. Both groups lose about 10 g/m2 during active weight reduction. Type 2 diabetes Mellitus has become an increasingly serious disease among African American females. Although there are no studies on the association between sugar sweetened drinks and increased risk of type 2 disease, our aim is to investigate whether consumption of sugarsweetened beverages can be used as a preventive measure against overweight children."
29290882,"In this study, we examine the effects of combined lid-warming and massage on meibomean gland and dysfunction. We conclude that it is possible to treat dry eye disease by using topical fatty acids such as alpha-aminoics or cyclosposoline A in combination with mechanical therapy. This treatment has been shown to be safe and efficacious for patients who have severe dry eyes. The authors present two novel studies: one on the use of heated eyelid warming devices and another on preservative free artificial tears. These studies are designed to assess the safety andefficacy of these new devices in patients with mild to moderate dryeye."
23001018,"The aim of this paper is to assess the cost and efficacyof warfarin, as well as other antithrombotics in patients with acute atrial fibrillation. We use a Markov decision-analysis model to predict the costs and quality adjusted survival of different anticoagulation regimens. In addition, we calculate the incremental health benefits of each regimen by comparing the results of the Re-LY study to 'a lifetime life horizon'. A Canadian population of 50000 patients was simulated at moderate risk of Stroke or death among them. Costeffectiveness was determined using an event-simulation model. This study included calculating the cumulative gain and incremental cost for dabigaran compared with adjustment-dose warforin. It also examined the effect of stroke on older patients who had nonvalveular atrium fibrillation; they were assigned either aspirin without prior stroke or ascipin alone or combined with low-ineffective doses Warfari. After evaluating the effects of age on blood pressure, stroke, and severity of bleeding, it was concluded that women are at greater risk for stroke than men. These studies have been conflicting about whether women should be at higher risk because of their increased risk from thrombotic treatment. Antithrobolic management in atary fibrilation is currently largely based on evidence of potential ""fine-tunting"" with transophagal echocardiograms but have not yet been proven safe. Riva Roxaban, an oral Fact Xa inhibiter, may provide better consistency and predictable antiblood poisoning thanwarfarn. Although these studies do not explicitly address stroke risks, they suggest that there may be certain risk factors associated with stroke in elderly people whom at least one has experienced."
26435098,"This study consists of two parts: 1) an exercise trial to determine the effect of walking with ski poles on patients with intermittent leg pain; and 2) a prospective observational study to assess the effects of home-based exercises on walking ability in people with peripheral arteries disease. The first part is designed to compare changes in performance and daily activity in patients who have intermittent clacudication due to his or her own disease, while the second part examines the effectiveness of ""supervised"" exercise training for improving quality of life after one year's follow-up."
24635850,This paper focuses on the use of an electrode-based device to assess spastic response in patients with stroke. It uses a motor driven system to track the velocity of the muscles and then uses surface electrodes to measure the changes in the muscle during stretching.
22984894,"This study focuses on the accuracy of the prosthetics in total kneearthroplasty. The aim is to compare the accurate technique of component alignment with two conventional methods using an Intramedullaary Guide for the Femur and either An Intramullary Guidance or an Extramedual Guide For the Tiba. In this study, we examine the results of three different surgical techniques: 1) conventional surgery; 2) computer-asisted navigation; and 3) conventional procedure. We find that both procedures result in better patient outcomes than those performed by conventional surgeons. A further study investigates the use of Doppler devices to track the signal intensity of single trackers in the imageless navigator system in patients who undergo complete knee replacement. Although there are no significant differences in blood loss between the two approaches, it is clear that the newer technology can be used to reduce blood losses."
19588332,"In this paper, we report the results of a large-scale, long-term study of elderly patients who have had reversable focal ischeic attacks. We conclude that these patients are at higher risk of developing stroke than those with other risk factors. This is an important finding because it suggests that there may be some benefit in lowering blood levels in people with elevated risk for heart disease. The main endpoint of the study was ""a composite of Coronary death, stroke, or myo Cardiol infa Rct Ion"" which means that all three major events occurred in the same patient group. A significant number of patients were treated with either prava statin 40mg/day or placebo. These patients showed improved outcome after their initial attack and reduced their risk by 24 percent. They also reported that they had no history of stroke or cardiovascular disease but did not experience any fatal or new strokes."
27258214,"The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence and severity of atrial fillation in a population aged 70 or over. This study will compare the efficacy of different approaches for detection of these disease, including targeted methods or whole population-based screening. In addition, it will assess the value of echocardiograms as additional risk stratification tools for stroke. Atrial Fibrilation has been recognized as an important independently risk factor for death and morbidity in older people. A multi-centred cluster-rand-omized controlled trial was set up with 50 primary care practices in the Westmidland and s; patients were assigned to systematic or obportunistic screens. All patients received education about the importance of ECG interpretation and electrode assessment. These subjects were divided into three groups: 1) intervention practice 2) control practice 3) routine practice. They were all selected from their respective populations. Each group was given one general practice that was allocated to either random or systematic rounds of testing. The main outcome measure was newly identified atrium fibrillation. Background Attractive fibrilation had been recognised asan important independent risk factors for thrombroembolic diseases such as stroke because it provides five-fold increases in risk. Therefore, this aim aims to identify the baseline prevalence by various strategies and in do so evaluate the incremental Cost-effectiveness Of different screening strategies --including targeted or entire population screen -- compared with Routical clinical practice's. Methods To determine whether the accuracy of General practitioners, practice nurses, and interpretive software on the use ofdifferent types of electrocorticogram to diagnoseatrial fibriliac. As many patients who have chronic AF need rapid, accurate Opportunely Screening, there is now new technology available to detect this condition. It is necessary for physicians to perform mass opsonistic tests using electrodes rather than conventional ones. There are also several other studies which suggest that men and women may be more likely to suffer strokes when they have attriotic atarrhythmia. Most studies indicate that heart failure and stroke occur with attributable causes but few studies report the exact cause of stroke except for two large European cohort studies. One of the most recent studies suggests that early detection can help prevent stroke in elderly persons. Another study reports that pulse palpations improve the ability of older individuals to recognize atary fibrilsation without increasing the risk of fatal stroke among them."
11074683,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective study on patients with lowback pain who have not been treated for at least one year. We use multiple regression analysis to identify factors that predict future outcome in these patients and compare the effects of Chiropractic and Physiotherapy on these factors. This is important because it will allow us to see whether the new technology has any effect on repeatability. A comparison between two different treatment strategies is necessary since there are many different approaches to treating back pain. One approach involves using correlations to determine prognostics. Another approach uses graphical techniques to calculate how much each measure changes over time. Finally, an alternative approach based on simple calculations is used to assess repeatableness. The efficaciousness of epidal corticosterroid injections does not seem to be related to either function capacity scores or work status. An Epidural Comtic Steerforth-Alarm Question-Question was used as an assessment of sciatica. It was found that the score did not relate to both functional capacity measures or physical function. However, the performance assessment and capacity testing were more sensitive to change than the other two methods. Thirteen subjects with lower back discomfort were followed up after treatment by six researchers. These studies investigated the relationship between centralization of low Back Pain/radiculopathyand the subjects' Rating of Functional Outcome. All patients received follow-up questions 6 months after their initial visit."
28599375,"In this double blinded, placebo-control study, 44 patients with Type 2 Diabetes were randomized to either consume probiotics or conventional yogurt for eight weeks. The subjects consumed 300 ml of probiotin containing LacTobacillus alphaphilus La 5 and Bifodobacteri lactisBb 12 in control group. This was the first study to assess the efficacy of Probiotic Plus Yogurt on Lipid Profile in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Although several studies report beneficial effects of proscribing these conditions, little evidence is available regarding the use ofprobiotic capsules in newly diagnosed Type 2, diabetic patients. Thirtyfour type 2 patients aged from 25 to 70 years were selected; they were divided into four groups of intervention: 1) consumption of prebiotic bread; 2) consumption only of synbiotic food; and 3) consumption no more than 200 g/day of conventional bread. Blood sample samples were collected after six weeks at the start of each experiment. After six days, blood sample specimens were tested for baseline sugar, insulin, TG, total cholesterol,LDL-C,HDL- C, malondehydes, high sensitive Crp, and I. 6, after which time blood samples are retested. A procriteous shake consists of Lactoicillin acidophilus L. acidophus NCFM, Bfidabacterium britum and fructofooligoscosacchardes. It has been used as an aid to treat Type 3 Diabetes mellitateus but it has not been reported to have any positive effects on blood glucose or lipoprotein profiles."
20011929,"In this paper, we describe a prospective study of the effects of mild peri-operative hypothermisa on blood loss and Transfusion requirements during major surgery. We assess the effect of forcing air warmers on core temperature, bleeding, transfusion, and post-surgement. The results of this study suggest that mildly heated patients may be better able to avoid hypothremia than those who are warmed by conventional blankets or forced air warming systems."
30921478,"A double blind trial comparing the efficaciousness of two different drugs in patients who have panic disorder is presented. In this paper, we report that all three groups improve during the first two months and then continue to improve over the next six months without significant change in dosage. The results are similar for both alprasolam and imipromine. This paper also discusses the use of serotonine-selective reupTake inhibitors as treatment for panic disorders. We examine the influence of depression on anxiety outcomes in a study of 304 patients with panic disease. Alpra soliloquy was found to significantly superior to placebo in the treatmentof panic attacks, phocbic avoidance, anticipatary anxiety, and general anxiety. These results were not evident for finishers; however, they suggest that there may be an advantage in using sertraline instead of placebo in treating these patients. Another paper describes the effects of short-term clonal therapy on quality of life and work productivity in subjects with severe panic problems. Although no prior history of mental illness has been reported, it is not known whether such conditions are due to distinct or more serious reasons. It is believed that physicians' pregnosis will predict outcome in drug treatments. However, studies have shown that patient response to medication can vary greatly depending on the severity of the patient's condition."
26578956,"Fabuless is a new food ingredient that has been shown to improve energy and appetite in patients with prostate cancer. In this study, 24 healthy subjects were assigned two groups: control group and yogurt treatment group. The first group consumed only one cup of commercially made Yogurt for three months; the second group consumes two cups of conventionally produced Greek-style dairy products for 10 days. This study examines the effect of plant sterol mixture on serum cholesterol when mixed with low fat dairy product in subjects with mildly hyperchosterolaemia. A parallel double blinded study was conducted in three different places in Finland and. Thirty thirty-two healthy females aged 16 years and 18 years were given either control or yogurt treatments. They were then divided into four groups by their age. After consuming preloads of high-fat, low-carbodyic content, they were asked to eat breakfast at each meal. At lunchtime, after breakfast, women were allowed to snack. On day 4, all the volunteers came back to the laboratory to consume an ardized dinner."
17285783,"In this paper, we report on the effects of a three-month trial of testosterone replacement in older men. The results suggest that lower levels of total testosterone may lead to improved health and function in elderly men with low blood levels. We conclude that age-related changes in body mass, muscle strength, and endurance may contribute to declines in growth and osterogen deficiention in women. However, there is no concluding evidence for the efficacy or safety of these treatments in old men; however, some studies have suggested that they might be more beneficial than others. For example, one study suggests that GH and Sex therapy may improve bone mineral dentition and reduce fracture risks. A further study reports that although there are beneficial effects from gynesterin and progestin treatment, recurrent adverse effects occur after 26 weeks"
25392297,"This paper describes the results of a European-wide, patient-centered, evidence-based approach to improving self-management for patients with Type 2 diabetes in the 28 European Member States. It is based on an eight-step model that predicts how well people will respond to changes in their lifestyle and health. The aim was to determine whether this education program would improve eye care among type 2 patients who had no knowledge of diet or medicine. In this study, we examined the effect of ""basnef"" belief, attitude, subjective  norm, and enabling factors"" on eye management among patients without any knowledge about disease. We also investigated the efficacy of two-week long educational programs for Chinese patients suffering from Type 2, which were divided into three groups: control group, intervention group; and experimental group. After receiving informed written consent, the treatment group received an education within three weeks. On the basis of HbA 1c and Fb1c levels, they compared before and six months after the intervention. Diabetes has grown rapidly in India since the past decade. Patient education can be very effective in relieving the burden of complications caused by poor awareness and lack of exercise. A Chinese peer-led medical practice called ""Project Dulce"" uses trained lay leaders as an alternative strategy to support patient Self-Management. Although there are many studies examining the effectiveness of such 'peer-lead' approaches in low- income Mexican American patients, these studies have not yet been validated."
29420704,"Transcathet aortics are becoming more and more common, but few studies have looked at the safety of second-generation heart valves. A prospective study is designed to evaluate the efficacy in patients with moderately severe stenoses who undergo transcatheliter repositioning or permanent pacemaker implant. The results of this study indicate that the Lotus Valve can be used as an alternative to surgical replacement for severely symptomatic men with severe acute ostosis. In addition, it has been shown that third- generation transCatheter Heart Valving devices may be more successful than first-gen devices because they do not involve conduction defects. This study also focuses on the use of newer generation prostheses to improve patient outcomes. It was reported that there were no published headtohead comparisons between these two devices. AIMS These studies aim to assess the performance of the next generation SAPIEN-3 transathector heartvalve system when used in Routine clinical practice. All patients receive Tavi with the sapien 3 system via directfemoral/transapical route; however, all patients received TTIV with either the self-extp and ING transcarhetic heartvagnation system. After evaluating the outcome of both methods, the French National Trans Catheters Aortic Varve Implantation registry includes over 300 patients from January 2011 until October 2011. Conduction disorders such as permanent Pacing Machines are known to cause complications during transcateheder augmentation. Predictors for post-PM implantation are still debated, although many studies suggest that PPM should be avoided in order to reduce the risk of complications."
29596495,"The effect of pharmacist-led care on the preventative, detection, and resolutionof medication-related issues in high- risk patients in secluded areas was studied. In this study, we examined whether an intervention to improve blood pressure could be more effective than usual care for patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. We found that even in higher- performing health systems, some patients have poor bloodpressure control because of poorly medication adherence; however, there is evidence that such treatment can lead to improvements in these patients. This study also examines whether ""clinical inerty"" -- inadequate intensification of medicine by the provider -- could contribute to improved A1c levels in patients who have type 2 disease. It is reported that case management has been associated with improved glyciaemic control and behavior in older adults with type 2, but it is not clear whether this model will work well in younger adults."
24698343,"The aim of this study is to determine whether a high-florose feeding induces changes in the body's insulin binding and sensitivity. In healthy subjects, there is no significant difference between body weight or fasting concentrations of blood glucose, insulin, and ketones. Fructoses are more effective at reducing both of these effects than glucose. A crossover design was used to examine the effect of consumption of low-fat foods on plasma fatty acid levels. It was found that men with hyperinsulinemia had higher total cholesterol and lower lipoprotein content than those with normal response."
10716002,"The results of a five-year study of posterior composite restouratives are presented. Thirtey patients with four or more lesions receive one restoration of either Ketaic-Fil, finished immediately, Chelonic-Fil, and Cerveident; eighteen patients return for their 10 year examinations. In this study, the effect of different clinical factors on the replacement rates of class-III amalgam restorations is examined. After ten years, 188 restoration remains intact in 89 patients, while 78 have been replaced. A group consisting of 70 patients who have had an overall restoration failure rate of greater than 40 has been divided into two groups: those with high failure rates and those without. This paper reports that the performance of the various types of high-compose dental amalgams used in the worldwide program of clinical trials were found to be superior to those using low-cocontent material."
19025503,"This paper describes the quality of evidence-based physiotherapy practices and compares the efficacy of an ""active strategy"" with a ""stand and ard dissemination"" approach. The results indicate that patients are more likely to follow the treatment plan than those who receive no active strategy. A cluster-regression analysis is used to assess the effect of this intervention on physical function, coping strategies, and beliefs about low back pain. In this study, twenty-two therapists collect patient data from 174 patients who received an active therapy strategy in which they were assigned one of two groups: 1) group receiving the guideline for acute ankle injury; 2) group using opinion leaders to educate their patients about the condition; or 3) group sending out the handouts of the new guidelines."
28942899,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of peer assessment to improve physical therapy practice. He uses a cluster-randomed control trial to compare the efficacy of an eight-day university education course for physical practitioners in treating patients with chronic back pain. The results suggest that it is more effective to use evidence-based practice than traditional methods such as case discussion and pre-testing. Anderson concludes by stating that ""Clinical practice guides are important for dissemminate new evidence about practice and thereby facilitate the application of Evidence-Based practice""."
10796834,"A prospective, i.e. single-blind, study is designed to assess the effectiveness and safety of laparcooscopic nerve ablation in women with severe endomiesis. The efficacies of both methods are similar, with the exception of a slight increase in the rate of pain relief at three months' follow-up."
30627441,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to treating scars using fractional photoneedling. They describe two different approaches: 1) an ablative bipolar fractionally radiofrequency device that uses electrode pin tip to deliver high energy; and 2) non-ablatic fractionals laser devices that use pulsed electric current. The first study compares efficacy with safety of conventionally used methods for treating acne Scars. Atrophic scarring has been reported in several studies, but no new treatments have been developed. For example, there are few studies comparing the effectiveness of single-pass Precise Pulsed Resurfacing with multiple-session Fractional Lasers or Carbon Diode Fractal Facial Screelation. This is the first report of such treatment in skin types I through VI."
24841177,"In this chapter, Anderson focuses on the use of prognostics as a tool for predicting future events and improving the quality of care given to patients with knee pain. He discusses two studies that have recently been published in peer-review journals. One is an attempt to determine the effects of strength training on people with painful knee osteoarthrits. The results are compared with those from healthy subjects. This study also uses machine-learning to predict changes in pain and function over time. A second study examines the effect of behavior-graded activity on symptoms of knee Osteoartritis. It is shown that BGA has some beneficial effects on certain sub-sections of patients but does not affect other characteristics."
12804458,"This study focuses on the effect of attending to patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes who have poor blood glucose control. The patient's satisfaction with their care is measured before, after, and after six months. In addition, the patient receives group-based psychological well-belief in order to improve their quality of life. These groups are divided into four groups: intervention group, control group; support group for 6 months; and no intervention at all. A paper describes a new type of self-evaluation program that uses an iPod touch as he/she learns how to manage his own diabetes. Both groups show significant improvements in their knowledge. They also report that they spend more time on education than conventional education. AIMS evaluates the effectiveness of ""automatic telephone disease management"" with nurse follow up as part of improving treatment processes and outcome in patients suffering from poorly controlled Type1 or Insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus. It was found that this method improved both length of stay by using phone calls and home visits. However, it did not lead to improvement in other measures of health."
27374001,"In this paper, Wu et al compares the functional outcomes of a novel walking device to those of an arthroscopic total knee replacement. The patients who receive the device spend more time up and down with their therapists than they do with the conventional walker. A direct anterior approach to total hip surgery reduces pain and improves quality of life in both groups. Another study examines whether pre-opportunity training for patients after total shoulder surgery can result in improved function and satisfaction. This study also focuses on the use of patient education to prevent dislocation following primary complete hip replacement using an anterolilateral approach."
28589531,"In this study, we examine the effects of a group-based self-management program on physical activity in Type 2 diabetes patients. Ninety two patients aged 62 years and 69 p.m. were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or control group. This was followed by another trial that examined whether physicians provided brief health lifestyle guidance to patients with Type 1 diabetes during usual care visit. The results showed no significant change in patient behavior. A further study was performed to determine whether telephonie disease management could be more effective for patients who had been previously treated with conventional care."
29219092,"This paper focuses on the relationship between children's early exposure to physical activity and their later behavior. It uses a telephone survey of 1,000 parents as controls, and then uses an observational approach to determine whether or not this association is true. The results are that children with more physical activities have greater frequency of interaction with their parents than children without physical involvement. In addition, it suggests that there may be some risk of premature weight gain in young children who watch more than three hours of daily entertainment."
30388164,"This study aims to investigate the relationship between activity intensity and body composition in a healthy Scottish population. The results indicate that moderate-intentional walking is associated with increased body mass, fat, waist circumference, blood pressure, and total cholesterol. In this study, we examine the association between physical activity and neighborhood safety as measured by step counts and time spent sitting at work. We conclude that there are three possible outcomes for these measures: 1) an increase in step count; 2) an improvement in health status; and 3) an improved quality of life."
26164054,"In this study, we examine the effects of benzazepine on patients with posttraumatic-stress disorder who have undergone mechanical ventilation. The results suggest that sedation may be more effective in treating PTSD than other treatment approaches. We conclude that there is a strong association between physical and mental health in patients following acutely ill conditions. Posttraumatic stress disorder has been identified among many patients in the ICU after they have had to undergo mechanical venturing. This paper describes an observational study designed to explore the relationship between psychological and physical changes in patient's memories of the irrational care unit and their use of drugs for reducing relapses into delirium."
22079932,"This paper describes a nine-month intervention program for older adults who have significant health, function, and qualityof life benefits atattributed to preventive occupational treatment. It also discusses the cost of such services as home visits and bereavements. The purpose of the study is to examine the long term effects of an evidence-based parenting program on children's lifecourse and child abuse or neglect. In this paper, parents are divided into three groups: 1) families with conduct problems; 2) families without mental illness; and 3) families that receive regular home visitation. Although there is little evidence of effectiveness in these groups, it is believed that they may be more cost effective than other forms of care."
23739312,"This paper describes a novel, web-based treatment for depression. It is described in this paper as an ""integrative, Web Based program deprexis,"" which covers various approaches such as behavior activation, cognitive restructuring, mindfulness/ acceptance exercises, and social skill training. The authors assess the effects of family-centered psychoeducational treatments on patients' relapses. They report that families receive more positive face to face interactional behavior after 9 months than those who receive only one type of multiple-famiable group. In addition, they report improvements in patient satisfaction with their group experience. Brain Snack: Depression is not always treated well; there are many studies reporting how long it takes for people to recover from depression or how effective these treatments are. There are few rand and ommized controlled trials designed to treat adults with unipolar mood disorders. Some have suggested that using hypnosists or other forms of psychological intervention may be more effective than usual care in treating patients with recurring depression but little has been published about the efficaciousness of these types of treatment."
19148113,"This paper focuses on the effects of infant care given by a mother-to-child interaction program. It is shown that mothers are more likely to respond to their babies' cues than they are to react to other children's, and this suggests that early intervention may be an effective strategy for improving child development. In addition, recent federal laws have made it possible for parents to receive multiple-disciplinary evaluations and assessment of suspected prematurely born births. The study also compares the services of two different types of early childhood care systems: the Chicago Child-Paternal Center and the traditional discharge/follow-up services provided by neonatal intensities. These studies do not report any long-term positive effects on academic performance or crime. However, most studies of late childhood educational intervention are of demonstrations rather than large scale public programs. Most studies show no effect on school performance but affect on education attainment and criminality. Preparations for fifteen years of follow- up in matched group cohorts of 1539 poor-poor children were conducted in 25 sites with 989 children. A center-based pre-school and school-informed intervention program was used to improve the mental and physically development of very low birth-weigh infants at less than 32 week gestational time. All surviving newborns were assigned either to normal or risk groups onthe basis of naivete; both groups were divided into intervention or nonintervention sub- groups. Both groups received high-quality center support in their second and third year of life. At age 3 months, 80 lowbirth-Weakborn Infants had been assigned to Normal or at-Risk groups according to the Bayley Scores Of Infant Development at one year corrected age. For those with higher participation rates, these estimates were calculated with new methodologies that found suited comparison groups within the follow Up group for those who had high participation rate. After five years, only 187 out of 284 unpremature babyhoods died before eligibility. Early hospitalization of Very Low-Bear-Wound infant girls has been recommended by Als al as an efficacious means of improving several medical outcome variable such as time upon ventilator, time to feed, the durationof hospital stay, better behavior on Assessment of Post-Term Idcap -- Brain Function and Structure, APIB -- and improved neurodebratory outcomes. Although many studies document how families adapt to being pregnant when they experience "
31210136,"This paper presents an estimate of the costs and benefits of a novel, evidence-based approach to treating heart failure in patients with documented chest disease. It uses hazemodynamous waveforms to predict events that are unlikely to lead to fatalities and suggests that the intervention could be more cost effective than other approaches."
24099581,"Elderly patients with a spinal cord injury are more likely to fall than others, and this may be due to decrements of their executive functions. This study focuses on the effects of an exercise program on falls in elderly patients who have fallen. The training group has 10 elderly people who participate in two tasks; the control group is 11 elderly who do not practice physical activity regularly. These studies include the Clock Drawing test, Frontal assessment battery, Berg balance scale, Timed up- and-Go test as well as several other tests. In this study, we examine the effect of supervised exercise on gait, balance, strength, memory, etc. We conclude that there is no way to predict falls for people with multiplesclerosis. A cross-sectioned mail survey was sent to 221 persons with incomplete spinalcord injury from reputable sources. It was then collected through surveys, interviews, performance testing, observation, medical records. There were also few functional measures used to assess falls among patients suffering from SCI. Walking ability was measured by the timed down and go test which quantifies how quickly one can fall. However, it was found that TUG time had negative association with Muscle Strength and Mobility scores. Thus, these studies aim to determine whether or not the Berg Balance scale can predict falling in patients without any known cause."
28202713,"In this chapter, we discuss the effects of high-dosing vitamin D on asthma and cold symptoms. We also examine whether it can reduce the mortality or morbidity in low birth weight infants in poor income countries. This is a very important issue because there are no rigorously designed trials that have examined the relationship between blood levels of 25HhD and acute respiratory infection. A double blinded trial was conducted to determine whether daily doses of 1,500 IU of ""cholecalcifyerol"" would prevent influenza from occurring in schoolchildren. The results showed that children who received 1,000 iu/d were less likely to get pneumonia than those who did not receive such treatment. Furthermore, studies suggest that higher levels may be associated with increased risk of upper lung infection; however, these studies do not support the use of large dose amounts of vitamin C as an effective strategy for preventing disease."
26777297,"In this study, we examine the relationship between drug use and symptomatic behavior in patients with recent-onset psychosus. We find that mild and heavy abuse of cannibalism is associated with more severe relapse than non-abusers. This association becomes stronger when mild or heavy alcohol abuse is distinguished. Although many studies have examined the effect of using cannics in psychiatrious patients, few have investigated the impact of their use on patient outcome. For example, there has been no evidence for a strong association between early onset symptoms and long-term use of drugs. Aim To determine whether change in Cannabis use affects psychological outcomes in people with established mental illness. Methods were used to assess the effects of acute doses of Cannabidial, C. Sativa, and Delta9-Tetrahocannabine on regional brain functions during verbal learning. The results showed that cannabis use had an increased risk of first-epsyd psychotic symptoms but did not increase the severity of these symptoms. Brain Function was also affected by changes in the frequency of consumption."
28919929,"This study focuses on the effects of an exercise program for older adults. It is shown that aerobic exercise can improve blood levels of growth factors, such as BDNF, IGF1 and vegf, while it can also improve motor function. The results are similar to those seen in animal studies. In this study, we examine changes in temporallobe functional connections between the parahippocap and the middle-temporal gyrius during learning. We conclude that exercise has a beneficial effect on brain function because it increases both physical and mental functions."
20374659,This paper focuses on the use of mignobustion as an alternative to conventional treatments for patients with a myelodramatic disease. It is shown that this form of treatment can be very effective in relieving pain and improving quality of life.
27082571,"The Swedish Trial In Old Patients with hypertension was a prospective, doubleblind, intervention study designed to compare the efficacy between active antihypersive therapy, three beta blockers and one Diuretic in reducing frequency of fatal or non-fatual stroke and other major cardiovascular death in elderly patients. This paper reports that blood pressure is reduced by 9/4mm Hg over an average follow-up period of 25 months. It has been five years since the European Society for Hypertension's publication of the 2010, hypertensively treatment guide; there have been new evidence about the management of this condition. A total patient population of 1627 were recruited from 116 health centers throughout Sweden. They met the entry requirements of three separate recording sessions during 1 month placebo run-out periodof sytolic bloodpressure between 180 and 200 mmHhg with varying diastonic pressures of at least 105/120 mHg. The total length of trial was 65 months, and the average duration in the studywas 25months. Since the previous edition of these guidelines had not yet been published, there are many new studies reporting on the effects of different types of drugs on various diseases. For example, the American Society of Heart Physicians publishes their latest report on heart disease in March of 2013. There are also several recent studies regarding the use of peridopril as an antithropetic agent against stroke. These include the Anti-Stimulatory Drugs for Vascular Demention: A multicentre, prospect I ve r and Omized controlled trial in 18257 patients with high risk for stroke who were assigned either Amlodipines 5 - 10, adding perindops 4 x 8 mg as needed or Atenol Lol 50  -- 100 mg adding Bendroflumezide 1.75 & Pot as required. After comparing the effect of both agents on mortality and severity of stroke, we conclude that they would be most effective in relieving the risk of severe myomyocardial injury. We furthermore describe the results of two additional studies concerning the effectiveness of candidian and epistasis in older patients suffering from mild to moderately hyper tension."
27495104,"In this double blinded, placebo controlled trial, 638 children were assigned re and ommly to either probiotic strains or no live cultures. Two primary outcome was assessed: incidence of common diseases and change of behaviour because of illness. The first was determined by the parental report. A second was established for the purpose of evaluating whether Lactobacilus casei DSM-114001 could reduce outbreaks of infectious diseases due to influenza in infants. This study included 6,38 healthy children aged 3 to 7 years old who suffered from three or more episodes of acute ear, nose, and throat disease during the previous year. All emergent illnesses were recorded by parent reports in a daily diary. Probiotics have been shown to be effective at preventing epidemics in young children. For example, one study showed that long-term feeding of proliferating milk can reduce fever and coughing in children under stress. Another study examined the role of lactobacterus GG in preventing nosocomic gastrointestinal and lung tract infections in hospitalized children as well as on immune function in sick shift workers. These studies investigated the effect of two different species of prosicillin on the prevention of cold and influenza like symptoms in healthy childhood. They concluded that proicrobials such as Lactopbacillus animalis subpsp may reduce the burden caused by infection in babies and toddlers but did not improve the severity of these conditions."
28459121,"We examine the physical, visual, health, and cognitive ability of 1,656, older adults as prospects i v predictors that self-re reported driving cessations over a five-year period. Age, heart failure, slowness of processing are significant risk factors; however, they do not seem to be associated with driving ceasesation. The Short Physical Perception Battery is used as an assessment of performance in older patients who have congestive hearts failure or other serious medical conditions. In this study, we use the Maryland and Older drivers project to determine whether older drivers' performance is related to motor vehicle crashes. This study also uses the Long-Term Cognitive and Functional Performance Measure to assess the effect of exercise training on older people's performance. Although there is little concluding evidence for the effectiveness of such exercises, it is suggested that they may reduce the risk of death from motor accident."
29392334,"In this study, Wuthering Heights demonstrates the efficacy of a progressive walking program in patients with advanced lung disease who undergoes resection. The results show that patients receive better physical activity and improved recovery after surgery than those in control group. This is an important finding because lung diseases are often associated with morbidity. Wuthringley concludes by stating that ""breathlessness"" is common among lung cancer patients and that it can be easily eliminated through exercise."
29762708,"In this paper, we examine the impact of an unconditional cash-transfer program on school attendance and child enrollment in three different districts of the poorest country in Africa. We conclude that the government's child grant program does not have any significant impact on early marriage, pregnancy, or sexual behavior among young women. However, there is evidence that such programs may have other beneficial effects on children: for example, they can reduce child labor in recipient households. This paper also discusses the use of conditional cash loans to improve health outcomes in sub-Africa. It uses cluster-randomized control experiments to assess whether household wealth affects financial stability and delayed entry into the program. The results suggest that poverty- targeted cash transfers can have positive effects upon youth transitions from childhood to adulthood; however, existing research has only limited evidence from small scale schemes in diverse geographical and cultural settings. A national unconditional Cash transfer program, the Kistolu Cash Transfer for Poor Children, was initially implemented in seven districts in central Malawi. Although it reduced the risk of pregnancy by 5 percentage points, it did not significantly increase the likelihood of getting married or having a child. Another study, conducted in Kenya, investigates whether the Government ""Chambound"" social cash transfer pilot scheme could reduce the risks of HIV infection among vulnerable children. There is little evidence regarding the effect of these programmes on mental health in African countries."
24633256,"In this paper, we examine the association between stroke risk and atrial fibrilation in patients with a prior history of stroke. We conclude that women are at greater risk for stroke than men because of their higher sex, hypertension, and previous stroke or embolilic events. Furthermore, studies have shown that female gender is more likely to be associated with an increased risk of heart attack than those of men."
30151552,"The aim of the trial is to compare the effect of a combination of physical activity and self-regulatory therapy on patients with chronic fatigue. In this paper, we describe an eight-week treatment program for patients who have been suffering from chronic fatigue for more than six months. We conclude that exercise can be used to improve symptoms in patients without compromising quality of life."
31337389,"In this study, we investigate the acute effects on blood glucose tolerance and reduced dietary energy consumption in patients with Type 2 Diabetes. We compare two Paleo-type diets: one that is ""Old Stone Age"" style and another that has been used for centuries to improve health. The results of these studies suggest that a paleolithically-styled diet can be more effective in improving blood sugar control than an all-out Mediterranean-like regimen. This study also reports on changes in satiiety during meal times. It was found that weight loss was associated with improved brain function in overweight women."
27157250,"In this paper, we describe a novel combination of red yeastrice extract, 500mg berberin, and 10 milliliters of policosols in patients with moderate-risk hypercholestemia. This treatment is especially effective for patients who have been previously treated with statins because they are not tolerated at low doses. The study concludes that this new approach to treating hyperchoesterolemia may be more successful than other approaches since it reduces the risk of heart attack and mortality. A recent study suggests that an astaxanine-containing diet can be used to improve blood lipid levels in subjects with mildly elevated lipoprotein concentrations; however, there is no concluding evidence regarding its efficacy or safety. Nutraceuticals such as Armolip Plus, Red yeast Rice Extract, Berberine, Folc acid, Coenzyme Qu 10, and Asthaxantehin have also been studied. They have shown promising results in reducing high-densitity lipodyphosphorylation but do not show any significant changes in total cholesterol or trigllycerides."
21791456,"This study aims to examine the association between exercise training and clustering of risk factors in young children from three different European countries. In this study, nineteen overweight children are assigned to an eight-week program of physical training. The results indicate that exercisetraining improves blood pressure and body weight in overweight girls. A further study is presented on the effect of school-based physical activity on health knowledge, health behavior, and risk factor for coronary disease in urban girls aged 9-16 years. It is shown that there is a significant relationship between physical fitness and heart disease risk among these subjects."
24314347,"In this paper, we use functional magnetic resonance to investigate the effect of a daily dose of dopamine on brain activity in patients with attention-defit/hypteractivity disorder. We examine whether the doomate increases induced by the drug are related to long-term treatment response. After 20 adults with ADHD were treated before starting treatment, they were then followed for 12 months after their initial treatment. The results showed that there was no significant difference in brain function between the two groups. Brain regions involved in time perception were also examined. Acutely methylphenis date increased temporal and cortical timing in children with hyperactive disorder but did not lead to improvement in other brain functions"
27150167,"The purpose of the present paper is to improve physicians' behavior in treating patients with osteopororosis. It consists of five quality circle phases that include: 1) training and baseline data collection, 2) first educational intervention and first follow-up studies, 3) background information, and 4) patient education. In this trial, 4264 people age 50 years old who have recently fractured or had no recent bone mineral dentition testing or treatment were asked for reminders about their fractures. This study was designed to assess whether sending reminder messages to physicians leads to improved post fracture care. A clustered R and Omized trial was conducted in Canada whereby 1,021 general practitioners from 75 practice practices were divided into three groups: group 1 receive usual care; group 2 has mailed notifications regarding the fracture sent by their primary care doctors; and group 3 has received both physicians and clients. All men and women over age 55 years were identified to be risky for Osteoprasis-related Fractures. Methods To evaluate an intervention to reduce xray visits and increases giving advice to Stay active for people With acute Low Back Pain in general practice. We test the impact of evidence-based medical education on individual care as well as patients' quality of Life."
29858467,"This paper focuses on the effects of mindful walking on patients with high perceived psychological distress. It uses a combination of self-regarding measures, such as step counts and health parameters, to examine the relationship between physical activity and mental health in older adults. The results suggest that walking is associated with improved health and well being for older people. A walk program has also been shown to be effective in reducing anxiety and depression among older women."
29325567,"In this paper, we describe the use of a validated 7-point clinical scale to predict death and need for hospitalization in elderly patients. We also examine the impact of fatigue on postoperative outcome in older patients with mild or moderate physical decline. This study uses the Timed Up and Go test to determine whether functional decline is associated with increased risk of complications after major open heart surgery. The results suggest that patient empowerment may reduce complication from hip fractures. A prospective cohort study describes an inpatient trauma consultation service designed to prevent and manage age-related complications and improve long-term outcome. Preoperative evaluations include medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and assessment of physical and mental function using the specific activity scale and the telephone interview for mental status. These studies are followed by re-evaluation of the Nutrition Screening initiative which was developed to identify low, moderate, high nutritional risk score scores among Medicare beneficiaries."

It is a first attempt at using this scale to assess the degree of severity of bingeing in overweight subjects. The results show that the scale successfully discriminates among persons judge by trained interviewer to have either ""no moderate or severe"" binges. In addition, the study uses the Spinal Cord injury Rehabilitation Evidence as heuristic evidence for improving the health of patients with spinal cord injury."
25380104,"In this paper, the authors present a prospective study of patients with recurrent symptoms after decompressive surgical treatment. They assess the efficacy of two different surgical techniques in treating Chiari I Malformation Type I: sutureless DuraGen and suturably Dur-Guard. The results indicate that thirty-four patients are enrolled in this study. A total age ranges from 38.7 to 12.2 years, mean SD St and arc Deviation; and 80 % of women were female. This study is an attempt to determine whether or not cranioccervical surgery will improve pain in patients who have had syrungomyelia. It was reported that it has failed in about 10 percent of these patients. To further characterize the severity of pain, we developed 'The Chiaris Symptom Profile'' which uses item analysis to predict how well the patient responds to various measures of function."

The treatment group showed greater gains in intelligence, language, and adaptive function than the eclectic group. This study also reports on a short-term effect of focused playtime intervention on young children who had been assigned to either parent-mediated or community-based treatment. A further study is presented that uses reciprocal imitation training to improve imitation skills in young adults with autism. Children with severe delusions of imitation are more likely to respond to these treatments than children without any apparent learning difficulties."

The primary endpoint was change from base to end in the Western Ohio and McMaster universities OsteoArtis Index pain sub scale score. Both groups had improved their knee functions, knee score, and pain scores. A total of thirteen95 patients received treatments. Three pilot studies were pooled; three pilots which were Poole's for a Meta-analysis comparing the effect of single application of-25mh ketoprofened in Digactin vs. placebo for thetreatment of pain caused by eccentric muscle contractures. This study concludes that topical anti-inflammatory drugs are safe and efficacious in treating acute pain but may have serious side effects. It is recommended that older patients be advised to take topicals or oral NSAids as they are more likely to cause systemic adverse events."
27568654,"In this paper, we describe the results of an rand-omized and a truncal trial comparing standard and hypofractional treatment for localized prostate disease. We report that men with elevated levels of PSA in their blood have better survival than those with normal levels. ADT improves overall survival among men who receive short-term therapy before and during surgery. The European Society of Prostate Oncology's study of screening for prostatecancer has shown reductions in mortality after nine years and eleven years of followup. Men with high PSAC are not recommended for routine or opported testing because they may be overdiagnosed. However, there is no concluding effect on long- term survival when compared to conventionally dosed regimens. Furthermore, radical prostaticide reduces death among patients with localizeed prostate cancer but important questions regarding longer-lived benefit remain unanswered"

In this paper, we examine the effect of an eight-week intervention on improving social function in patients with severe autism. We conclude that horses can be used to treat these children because they exhibit greater sensory seeking, sensing, and motivation than other types of treatment. The results suggest that treating animals with imitation may lead to improved social functions in children who have mild to moderately severe Autism."

It is an observational cross-examination of 420 general practitioners, 154 surgeons, and 110 ynanaec physicians practicing in France. The study was designed to assess physician-and patient-rated treatment comply with Osteoprarosis treatments; to evaluate factors that influence compliance. In this paper, we examine the effect of ""education"" on women's knowledge of osteoperosus. We conclude that it is important for women to be educated about their condition so that they can make informed decisions about how to treat them. A multi-disciplinary education program has been developed for postmenopalausal women who are at risk for fractures. These women were divided into two groups: one group received specific pharmacology treatment and the other group followed a controlled regimen of four weeks. They were then taught self-reporting changes in health behavior using kh Gr. Two studies have been published regarding the effectiveness of educational methods for improving bone mineral dentition. One study showed that there was no significant difference in quality of life between control and intervention groups. Another study reported that educating older women with hip fracture could reduce their risk of fracture by 55 %). Finally, another study examined whether pharmacists could improve testing and treatment rates of elderly women suffering from osteoporoseis."

It is shown that physical activity is important for children's health, but little is known about how it is influenced by gender and body mass. In this paper, we examine the effects of parents' active play on young children during their early childhood days. We use an accelerometer-based instrument to track time spent in vigorous and light-intentioned activities. The results suggest that there are significant relationships between moderate and vigorous exercise in children at different ages."
20969769,"This study focuses on the needs of physicians in order to determine information needed about management of Osteorosis. The results of this study indicate that family physicians are willing to share information about treatment and care for patients with fractures. A survey is sent to 1000 family doctors in Canada in May of 2000 asking them about their experiences with hip fracture, as well as their preferred methods of treatment. In addition, the study uses time-motion studies to calculate costeffectiveness of an intervention against usual care. Although there have been many controlled trials of treating osteoporoseis in men, no large trial has been performed. There have also been no long-term studies of how best to treat bone mineral dentition in postmanopausals. For example, one study showed that risedronate could reduce the risk from vertebral injuries in women with established or pre-existing knee pain. Another study examined whether a patient education program could improve the qualityof care given to older adults who had received glucocolaticoid therapy. It was found that elderly people were more likely to be treated with alendronates than those with placebo. Finally, we report that our ""case manager"" intervention improved the rate of appropriate treatment within six months when compared with standard care; it was able to increase the percentage of primary care physicians who attended to patients after they had regained their health."

It compares three different types of physiotherapies to determine whether they can be used to prevent or delay these complications. In this study, we examine the effects of incentive breathing exercises and physical therapy on lung function after elective thoracomy. The results show that there is no significant difference in the amount of time required for improvement in both groups. We also discuss the use of blow bottles as an alternative to standard chest exercise for patients with severe atelectaticsis."

The results of this study suggest that lower dose HRT may be more protective against stroke than conventional treatment. This study also suggests that raloxiferene reduces the incidence of stroke in different patient groups. In addition, it is reported that progestine increases bone mineral density in elderly women who have been treated with estrogen or escorts to an outpatient center for four years. These studies are followed by two further studies designed to determine whether breast-cancer risk is increased by using conjugated Equine Estradiol as a contraceptive. They conclude that there is no association between elevated levels of serum Uric acid and coronary disease among postmenophausal women taking hormone replacement therapy. Women's health initiative has developed several trials to assess the benefits of long-term maintenance of bone mass and function. Although these trials do not prove to be highly beneficial, they provide some evidence that use of short-lived cordial estriol can help prevent heart disease."

A model is developed to estimate the costs of depression in terms of both dropouts and efficacy. In this study, patients with major depression are assigned to either pharmaccotherapy or ""interpersonal psychotherapy"" provided in'st and an ardized frame'. The cost of treatment is calculated. This study also augments another controlled trial to examine the cost-efficacy of two different approaches for treating major depressive disorders relative to each others. These studies include primary care patients who meet DSM III-R criteria as well as those who are not in active therapy.

It is a novel approach to improving patients' health by focusing on patient education and self-reporting. The authors present evidence that patients are more likely to adopt physiotherapy than other forms of exercise, suggesting that this form of treatment may be more successful in relieving pain and improving quality of life."
31073341,"The majority of elderly adults do not get the recommended amount of physical activity in their daily lives, and this may be due to their overestimation of their exercise intensity. This study aims to determine whether using an accelerometer as an intervention can increase time spent walking at moderate intensity by older adults with chronic disease. In this single-blind trial, we divided participants into two groups: control group received 8 hours of walking per week or the intervention group was assigned to receive either one of two controlled interventions. We then used minimization for age, sexe, FEV1, percent predicted ; and baseline exercisecapability andphysical activity levels. A physically active life is essential for health, but there are conflicting evidence about its efficacy. Walking has been shown to improve step counts and moderate to intense intensity physical activities in older people. However, many older women track their exercises on a device known as ""Palm,"" which uses electrodes to track steps and paces while they walk. These devices are inexpensive and easily used, making it possible for older patients to accumulate more than adequate amounts of movement."
23235671,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed description of the predictor and modifiers that are used to predict response to morphine in patients with severe depression. They conclude that it is necessary for them to use multiple regression methods to identify potential predicters and moderators of patient response. The results suggest that both drugs are more efficacious than placebo in treating major depressive disease. A double- blinded trial compares amitrapine, amitritine, and mirtrazine in outpatients with major depression who have been assigned either short-term treatment or two weeks later. Both treatments produce significant improvements in severity of symptoms. However, there is no difference in improvement on Hamilton Rating scales for depression and the ClinicalGlobal Impressions scale."
28635182,"The effect of partially dietary replacement with alpha lipolenicic acid on plasmalipids is investigated in twenty nine healthy young men. After two weeks stability period, subjects were assigned to either group with low-carbohydrate intake; GriceLC, 35 %of carbohidrate and 60 gram of raw rice per day; and GfLaxLC: 32 p.g. of carotenic fibers. Blood pressure, anthropometry measures and serum values of isopropstane, C-Reactive Protein, glucose, blood profile, leptosis, and insulin were calculated at baseline and after the intervention. Flax seed has received attention as an anti-inflammatory but antioxidant. This study investigates the effects of fats enriched by vegetable oils on blood fatty acid concentrations in older adults. A double blinded crossover study was conducted with 110 older adult subjects. Both groups receive nutritional guidance and are supplementated for 180 days with monthlyblood collection for biochemistry analysis. In this trial, firefighters were divided into six experimental groups receiving either flax oil, fish oil or sunflower oil. They were then divided according to their age and body mass. Each group consumed three different diets -- a low fiber control diet ""Control"", one with coconut oil that contained 20 g whole grain/d, or one without wheat bran. These subjects had similar energy expenditure and weight balance. Fats were measured in blood samples before andafter each period. Biochemical analysis was carried out using blood drawn every two wk. The results showed that both groups maintain their diet high in Alpha Linolnic acid and low in Li Linolesic Acid. Their consumption also increased the levels of total phospholiphose content of red blood cell cells. As part of this study, we examined how flaixseed could improve the health of prostate cancer patients. Prostate disease affects only one of six people during their lifetime. Dietal factors are postulated to influence the progress and progression of prostatectomy. Consuming flacs seeds may offer potentiallyprotective strategies. Plasma inflammation markers such as CRP,TNF-,and IL-6 show signs of hyperglyciaemia. Type II diabetic patients were given supplements from fist cream or corn oil which contained 5.49 m."
31768318,"Transcutaneous electrical nerve therapy improves colonic transit for children with slow transit constipations. In this study, we examine the effect of transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation on overactive bladder symptoms in children aged 7 to 12 years. The results of both treatment groups show good efficacy. Urotherapy is the most common voiding disease in childhood, and its primary manifestation is Ury Urinary Incontinence. A double blinded placebo-controlled trial was performed in 16 children suffering from over active bladder. Parasalcral Transcutive Electrical Neural Stimulation was introduced as another alternative for the treat of detrudersor over activity in young children; but treatment protocol described to date required several sessions per weeks or long lasting sessions making it difficultfor the child to stick to the treatment. This study focuses on sixteen children who suffer from Overactive Blading Syndrome. Prior to medical therapy, a three-week lifestyle advice was established. Peptipoetry We evaluated the effects of percutaneous electrodes on vouching dysfunction in patients with therapy resistant, nonnuropathic bladder stench dysfunction. Purpose We evaluate the efficiacy of so lifenacin in adult overactivity bladder conditions. Prevalence and natural history are determined among schoolchildren at age 11 - 13 years old. Schoolchildren reported daywetting and nocturnal anuresis when they were younger. Percutaneous neuromodulating was used to treat urinarry urgency and urge disorder in adults with nonNeurological bladder Dystomy."
28941967,"In this study, Wuthering Heights demonstrates that patients who follow an ""accelerated rehabilitation"" regimen after a fracture are better off in the long run than those following stand and ard therapy. This is especially interesting because it shows that there is no difference in patient-rated wrist function between patients with or without comorestable injuries. The aim here is to investigate whether there will be definite differences in Patient-Rerated WristH and Evaluation scores between people with and without conorbidities. There was no significant difference at all in either group. A distal bone fracture is one of the most commonly treated fractures. It is often immobilized for several weeks leading to loss of range of motion, weakness, and changes in motor skills. Early mobilization produces less pain and stronger grip. However, there was not significant improvement in final rangeof motion. Immobilization for six weeks does not lead to greater reduction of injury. Instead, it leads to reduced movement of muscles and joints. After two different methods of treatment, the effect of exercise on the healing process is described. One group receives conventional short arm plaster casts while the other uses flexible casting. Functional recovery is assessed by measures of grip strength and ankle function over three years. Twenty patients have been divided into two groups: one group has physical therapy only and the second group includes exercises designed to improve functional recovery. Osteoactive exercises were used as part of their rehabilitation program. Women with low Bone Mineral Density were excluded from the study. They were assigned to both groups; they received physical training only. Their results were measured at three months after the initial cast removal and then at six months before the end of each session. Both groups had similar results. Postmenopaual women with high bone mineral densitivity were included in these studies. Although many studies have examined the effects of such exercises for women suffering from osteoporoseis, few trials have evaluated the efficaciousness of combined physical/occupational therapy in comparison to physical activity alone in patientswith conservatively treated dital radius fracture. These studies showed that early mobilisation resulted in faster recovery but did not improve shoulder function. Later, we investigated the effectiveness of manual edemastic mobilizations in treating minorly displaced disculsions using modified mechanical forces."
24862702,"In this study, the effect of determining the working length of an endodontic patient with an electrode-apex-locator is compared against the use of conventional methods. The results indicate that the method used by the Tri AutoZX produces superior results in obtaining a precise final work length."
22071397,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the efficacy and acceptability of an after school team sports program to reduce weight gain among low- income overweight children. He uses a pilot study to assess the effects of physical activity on girls' health and suggests that it is important to use these predictors in future studies. The results suggest that girls are more likely to participate in community sports, selfefficacy toward overcoming barriers, enjoyment of education physical education, race, white than black, and perceived mother's activity levels were significant predictrs of vigorousness. Anderson concludes by examining the association between energy gap and leisure activities among African American and white girls from different weight groups. This study compares the affective response of young girls with those of control subjects for further intervention. It is concluded that although childhood obesity is increasing rapidly, treatment options remain limited and that involvement of other sources of society such as sports clubs can be effective."
23369854,"Heart failure treatment guideline emphasizes daily weight tracking in patients with heart failing. However, this practice is not supported by a controlled trial. In this study, we determine whether daily reports of weight will reduce re hospitalization and mortality rate despite aggressive guidanceline driven heart failure care. We use OptiVol technology to track impedance measurements in 335 patients who have had an implantable Cardioverter-Defibrilator alone or with cardined cardiac rsynchronization therapy. All devices feature sensitivity and negative predictive value for predicting if the patient has worsening left ventricular function. The European InSync Seistry Observationsal Study was designed to assess the utility of device-based intrathorac fluid monitoring for detection of heart fail condition. This study included 3,35 subjects with chronic heart failed who had underwent implantation of either an ICD or baptizer defidebrillator. Each device featured spectral values that could be used as predictors of changes in blood pressure and/or heart rate. These were validated in three studies: 1) Acute Heart Failure Syndromes; 2) Nurse-Directed Heart Failure Disease Management; and 3) Home Telemonitoling. Our aim was to identify whether ""home telemonitory"" improved outcomes compared against nurse telephone support -- NTS -- and usual care -- for patients at high risks of hospitalizing or death. Hamilton's group received the Span-CHF heart disease management program, which consisted of self-management, guided medication, and follow-up visits. They also studied 1820 patients treated with tachiarrhythmics and heart fails. After 4.5 years, they followed 1801 patients from New York Heart Society class I or III. Their primary end point would be death from any causes or nonfatal heartsfailures event. Heart Faulure events were adjudicated by physicians who knew of the treatment assignment but they were assigned by their committee unaware of assignments."
28447854,"In this study, we examine whether a visual cue can influence an accurate portion size without altering the estimated amount of food consumed. We conclude that it is possible to use self-re refilling soupbowls to increase appetite without changing either estimated intake nor satiation. The results of this experiment are presented in two different ways: first, by using ""an accurate visualcue"" of one type of bowl and second, through omization of serving size with varying degrees of volume. This study also uses observational methods to assess whether Mediterranean-type foods may reduce the risk of heart attack after initial myomyocardial injury. A secondary prevention trial was designed to test whether diets from the Mediterranean style could reduce death or major secondary endpoints after completing 27 months' follow-up. After three composite outcomes, which combine either cardiac deaths or nonfatal MyoCardinal Infactorion, were studied. Although increasing evidence suggests the importance of practices in explaining health behavior, many studies remain solely on predictions that emphasize the roles of conscious intentions. To test their importance, their Role in Explaining Unhealthy Snacking Behavior in Counties N= 1,113; they compare four different strategies for improving WillingnesstoTaste disliked vegetables. First, all participants receive the same information treatment but then both groups engage in self regulation techniques. Second, women between age 30, and 50 years old participate in another 24 month rand comparing two short interventions. All participants received only information intervention while those in the information alone group learned brisk self regulate techniques that integrate mental contrast with implementation intentions"". Finally, subjects in both directions ate more fruit and vegetables than at baseline levels during the first four months after intervention. These results suggest that reward circuitry might be involved in future increases in blood oxygen content."
24749160,"In this paper, the authors examine whether sleep-deprived individuals are able to use stimulants to improve their performance on certain tasks. After 44 hours of awakeness, they receive a double blinded dose of either one of three stimulant drugs or placebo. The results indicate that there is no significant effect of drug on memory span, spatial working memories, rapid visual info processing, or attentional shifts. A mesmephalic dophin system for reinforcementlearning and an error-retrieval system associated with right frontoskeletal circuitry are described. This study investigates the efficability of modamfinil for improving response inhibition in adults with ADHD. It is unclear whether these effects stem from placebos, which may have been important factors in initiation and maintaining nonmedical uses of prescription medication. Although many studies have examined the effects medicinal salts such as MAS seem to have some positive effects on healthy young people, it is not yet clear how they can be used to treat mental illness."
27997982,"This study focuses on the effect of post-bleaching treatments to prevent resteaining, improve enamel surface hardness, and reduce tooth sensitivity. Thirty healthy patients were divided into four groups and submi was ttered to a one-45 minute in-office Bleacher session with either 20 or 35 %) hydrogen peroxe. The patient's color was evaluated by the value-orientated shade guide VIA Classical at various periods up to twelve months after bleachering. In vitro studies examined the effects of home-bleeding and laser-assistant in office bleaching on white spot lessions. Forty Bovine teeth were selected and implored to immerse for 12 weeks in demineralize solution. Enammel blocks were formed and assigned to seven treatment groups. Each group was assigned an appropriate 10 % carbamide peroxidic bleach agent. A control group underwent ""home use"" BleakCloth,"" which was used for 8 hours daily over two weeks; another group received ""colgate Platinum"" as well as ""starbrite."" All subjects were exposed to fluoride during this period. These experiments were carried out under laboratory conditions."
26655787,"The aim of this paper is to determine whether a diet-based weight loss program can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in Type 2 diabetes. In this study, overweight or obese patients with Type 2, who are not receiving adequate exercise, lose their weight and improve their blood pressure by attending regular physical activity consultations. This results in greater weight Loss for the intervention groups than that of control conditions at 1 year. Glycemia control markers and total body fat decline in the treatment group compared with controls at 3 months. However, there is no significant difference in heart disease risk between the two groups. Aim/hypothetical To investigate the efficability of an intense lifestyle intervention on promoting health in people with type 2 Diabetes. Methods: A total of 1,033) eligible Japanese menand women aged 40-70 years were rected and omedized to 'conventional treatment'; which continued to be received the usual care'. An intervention group consisted of education on lifestyle changes regarding dietary habit, physical activities, andadherence to treatment through telephone contacts, collaborative goalsetting, as well as routine medical care. Results: Although status of controlled major cardiovascular risk factors did not differ among groups during the trial period,the incidence of stroke was significantly lower in both groups after 8 years. Purpose: To evaluate the effect of ""collaborative case management intervention"" for patients without poorly controlled type II diabetes on general health, intermediate cardiovascular risks, satisfaction with practice, etc."
17356688,"In this paper, we compare the efficaciousness of a combination of carbamagepine, pacramine, and veproate in children with tonicclonic seizures. Children receive no significant changes in their intelligence or behavior after eight to twelve months of treatment; however, there are detrimental effects on memory for which serum levels influenced scores and in comprehending, in that long treatment time affected performances. The use of mephobbital as an anticonvulsionsant has not been well studied in developing countries because of reported side effects. A double blinded study is carried out using single daily dose of either phenomepravaine or carbamamaze pine to prevent recurrent seizures following an initial seizure. This trial was conducted in three different groups: 1) patients who had first convulsed during fever were given diazeparam or hypobarbiton; 2) patients treated with placebo were then given prophylactic drugs; and finally 3) patients received valproates or other antiepilsants. Although these regimens did not lead to improvement in patient health, they showed signs of improving performance."
30690935,"In this study, we investigate the effects of intransal oxtocin on depression in women with post-natal depression. We find that opium induces an increase in anxiousness over the treatment session and that it is also associated with increased maternal anxiety. This paper furthermore explores the role of Oxt in mothers with Post-Negrative Depression. It was found that when mothers were treated with OT, they were more sensitive to cry sounds and were less likely to take harsh caregiving strategies. Gossesip is another social behavior that seems to be related to its evolution. The aim here is to evaluate the effect of gossipping on cortisole and oxytonicity. Twenty-five female students were assigned to gossip conversations or to emotional nongossiep conversation. All participants underwent neutral conversation upon the second day after the study. Flares in the designs, conduct, analysis, and reporting can cause the action of an intervention not to have been underestimated nor overestived."
24300225,"This paper focuses on the relationship between physical activity and low back pain. It uses a population-based survey of Danish patients to examine the effect of exercise on their pain over five years. In this paper, we aim to explore the association between changes in physical activities and the way people perceive and behave when they are suffering from lowback pain as well as the impact of these perceptions and behavior on physical movement. We use telephonic surveys to assess the extent of chronic low Back Pain in Denmark. A representative sample of two thousand and people aged 30, to 50 years was selected. The main outcome measure was number of days with Low Back Arthritis during the pastyear. Preferences Questionnaires were used to determine whether or not patients benefited from an exercise program.

17258623,"This study focuses on the seal of two endodontic restoratives, using single-rooted bovine root canals. The teeth are instrumented in two groups and then removed with either Scotch Bond or Panavia 21, as bonding agents. In addition, the dentine bonds are bonded by nail varnish. Smear layer removes the barrier between the tooth and an adhesive, but does not prevent direct contact between them. Aim To compare the performance of three different types of sealing agents: Prime and Bond NT, PromptL-Pop, Cleanfil Se Bond, and Ebs-Multi. Inside the pulp chamber, they are treated with five % Naocl for 1 min. Finally, this study examines how well the guttapercha sealer is able to resist leakage from coronal direction. It is found that there is no significant difference in the amount of hole at the gumtal cementum/dentin margins when used with light-cured glasses. However, it is suggested that the use of thermoplastic techniques may be advantageous since they can achieve better sealability than conventional methods."
22895954,"Systoic Hypertension in Olderly Program This study focuses on the effects of treatment on stroke and death by type, subtype, and timing of stroke. The outcome of this trial is that there is a 36 percent reduction in total stroke in active treatment group. In addition, there was no significant relation between mortality or stroke with body mass index in the placebo-controlled group; there were u- or Jshaped relation in both groups. A comparison of blood pressure changes among mild hypertension patients who receive low-dosed diuretics and those receiving calcium antagonists has been made. Two studies have been carried out to determine whether different doses are effective for reducing symptoms of acute coronary heart attack. One of these studies uses an endpoint determination to assess the effect of antihypersive therapy on risk of fatal stroke as well as nonfatal complications. Another study compares the incidence rate of cardiovascular complications from two different drugs: bendro fluazide plus amiloride combined with hydrocholorothiachide. These results suggest that either combination of drugs may be more effective than one alone."
32292049,"In this study, we investigate the effect of coffee on blood pressure and endotheal function. We compared two different forms of ingestion: caffeination-coffeine and decafinated coffee. The results suggest that consumption of both types of drinks may lead to reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Acupinating coffee with antioxidants can also improve blood vessel function; however, there is little evidence yet regarding the effects of these compounds on other body systems."
31522379,"In this study, we examine the effect of ad-libitum, low- carbohydrate diet on body weight. We conclude that it is possible to lose body fat by increasing the amount of protein in the diet while maintaining the high-carb content of the food. Appetite and caloric consumption are measured in 19 subject placed sequentially upon the following diet: 'a weight-Maintainting diet', / an isocaoric diet"" ; thyme-based diets for two wk or 12 h; and an Ad Libitum diet for 12 weeks. Blood was collected frequently at the final phase to measure blood concentration under the plasmaconcentration versus time curve. The results of these studies suggest that ""reproduction has been associated as an importance factor for long term weight gain among females."" A previous trial had successfully produced post partum weight loss but needs further evidence. Women were assigned to one of three groups: 1) adherence to the New Nordic Digestion program; 2) escorted by hypnotists; or 3) instructed to follow the prescribed diet plan. After six months, all women received either the NDA or average Danish diet. They were then followed for 26 weeks with no further guidance. This paper discusses the role of excess fat in heart failure and suggests that there may be some basis for increased fat accumulation in patients who are overweight."
32162242,"This study focuses on the use of neurocognition testing to predict whether high school andcollegiate athletes who have been injured during a recent concussession experience significant changes in their performance. A battery of pre-concurssion assessment and cognitive tests is used to assess post-injuy symptoms and function in patients with mildtraumatic brain injury. Although previous studies have suggested that mild trauma may lead to delayed recovery, this study has not yet been performed. The aim of the present study is to determine whether there are differences in pre or post injuries between white and African American college students. In addition, it is hypothesizes for the first time that head injury can compromise attention and executive functions in young adults. Brain injury occurs frequently during contact sport, and current guidelines recommend no return to play until an injury is confirmed. However, many studies suggest that early signs of brain damage following mtbi may be associated with increased risk of long-term memory loss."
17526675,"In this study, the authors examine the effect of a simple needle-to-balloon technique on the function of the peripheral muscle in patients with mild to severe chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease. They compare the results of two different methods: one using syphilis and the other using Bergström needle technology. The subjects report no pain or very much with either method. We hypothergesize that patients suffering from moderately severe obstrutive pulmonary disease develop contractile fatigue during cycle exercise. These patients have characteristic features that may increase susceptability to fatigue. This study aims to investigate the relationships between skeletal muscles, fiber type composition, functional respiratory improvement and exercise tolerance among patients who have moderate to severely chronic obstrucive pulicy disease such as COPD. A group consisting of 22 patients and 10 control subjects is studied. Carbon monoxide concentrations are reduced; arterial oxygen tension is normal or slightly changed. Dysfunct muscles contribute to exercise intolerability in acute plebeiaded psoriasis. Men with chronic lung disease have high levels of low testosterone, which may lead to muscle weakness"
26732899,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights discusses the use of surface EMG to classify subjects who are in low back pain. He uses a fatigue-based test protocol that has been used successfully for patients with chronic lowback pain but does not apply to people with acute pain because their muscles are too weak to perform erect lifts. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of continuous ultrasound plus exercise on paraverteblastic muscles of patients suffering from chronic nonspecific low Back Pain. Aim This study was designed to examine the effect of constant ultrasound and exercise over the endurance of Paraverterebral Muscles of Patients with Chronic Nonspecific Low Back Arthwork. It was performed by 22 patients treated with 10 sessions of physical therapy including continuous US Plus exercise. Mass Grad was consistently displayed p' 05, giving an improved relationship with endurance times for the task. Furthermore, the rate of decline of the surface Emg power spectrum was evaluated for its usefulness in monitoring the Fatigability Of the Erector Spinae Muscules during the performanceof submaxial isometric exercises. There was no significant difference between mean Emmg values recorded from right and left arm muscles at either lordonic postures or at lumbar level. Bidding further investigation into the validity of using surface electrodemyography as an assessment of back muscle fatigue, Wollstonecraft focuses on two important areas: 1) whether dynamic back muscles induce more fatigue than hip extenors in normal controls as well; and 2) whether there is sensitivity to paucity/type I fiber content in the patient's leg muscles. These studies will help us understand how we can use our new technology to assess pain in patients without any specific disease."

In this study, 24 patients were divided into two groups: one group was treated with ""sulphuruous"" water and the other was bathed exclusively in warm water. After four weeks, both groups had different results. Both groups showed marked improvement in pain, range of movement, tenderness, and scores on the Oswaldry Index. A further study was carriedout by 60 patients who had chronic low back Pain. This study examined the effects of spa therapy on knee pain; there was no significant difference between the treatments except for pain score.

20451780,"This study demonstrates the shear strength of orthodontic braces bonded to an enamel surface with a fluoride release system. Forty human premorals were divided in four groups, and each group was tested at varying crosshead speeds. The results showed that the bonding process was more effective when the teeth were etched with 37 p.ric acid than when they were stained with 35 % peroxide. In this study, two different self-etched primers -- Assure and Meith -- were used to bond tooth samples. Shear bonds were measured at 1 mm intervals and the failure rate was calculated by using the remnant index. Two experiments were performed on these same specimens: first, one experiment treated with dilute saltic acid; second, another experiment applied with silicone sulphate. Both experiments proved satisfactory for all groups except Fortwo clinical trials were carried out on 24 hours later. Bonding tests were conducted on six types of metal brackets as well as on three different type of enamel surfaces. These studies examined the performance of both adhesives while comparing the success of the conventional and selfligating bracket systems. Thirty patients entered the test and 607 new braced teeth had been cured. A comparison between the standard and Self Ligating Bracketed Systems was made. All thirty subjects were collected and divided into five groups. Each group consisted of twenty teeth. One group used lightcured Adhesive and Primer Transbond xt with St and Ard stainless steel braclets. Another paper was published discussing the effect of BisCover on the resistance of single-layer resins to debonding forces."

They report that it is possible to train people at an early age after their stroke without disrupting their daily activities. The aim of this study is to determine whether repetitive walking exercises are as effective as conventional therapy for post-stroke patients. This trial uses omization and blinded observation to assess the effect of repeated walking exercise on the modified MotricityIndex scale. After six weeks, results show that both treatment groups achieve similar improvements in performance."

Thirty girls with fagital pain were assigned to either exercise therapy group or control group, and their results were measured by the Fibro myalgic impact Question naire, Beck depression inventory, tender point scores, short form 36 question ennedment, health survey, self-efficacy scale, etc. After eight months of training, the exercise intervention group improved in terms of physically function, pain, stiffness, anxiety, depression, fibromyal GiA Impact Question Annex score, Canadian Aerobic fitness, H andgrip Dynamometry, 10-M walking, 10 step stair climbing and blind one leg stance. Aims To evaluate the benefits of pool-based exercises on pain during and afterwards as part of an overall multimodal Physiotherapy program for women with Filiargis Syndrome. Methods Forty-five subjects were re-employed to whichever group was best; they were then divided into two separate groups. They were evaluated at the start but after 12 weeks: VAS, Number of tender points, FIQ, SF-18, PSQ I, BMI, Tender Point count, Patient Global Assessment Score, Evaluation adherence levels. In this study, we examine the effects of swimming bathing on patients with feverish musculoliskeletal pain. We find no significant difference between these two groups except for the change in pain scores.

27730178,"A novel exercise training program has been developed for patients with severe obstrutive pulmonary disease. In addition, the patients are given resistance training to improve their health-related performance. The results of this study indicate that both groups of patients show improvement in their exercise capacity and strength. This is an important finding because it suggests that exercise can be used as a preventative measure against exercise-induced hyperinfliction. Another study was conducted on 29 patients who were not hypoxic but had high oxygen tension. These patients were then assigned to either endurance training or resistancetraining. Thirteen patients each received one of three different types of training: endurance plus strength; endurance alone; or ""sham"" training. Both groups showed significant improvements in physical function and health related quality of life. Two other studies examined the effect of long-term positive pressure ventilation using breathless breathing. One study investigated whether lung regeneration could be improved by adding L-Carnitine to another whole-body/repair training regimen. Sixteen subjects were divided into three groups: group A receives upper limb exercises, group B receive lower ones, and control group C receive both upper AND lower leg training"
22211304,"This study focuses on the effect of different tooth-extraction techniques on alveoolar ridge reduction. The aim is to compare the results of three different methods: 1) magnesium-enriched bone allo Grafts, 2) Calcium Sulfate-filled sockets; and 3) flapless extraction. In this study, we evaluate whether or not an application of clot can prevent or reduce the resorption of the extracted tooth. We conclude that it is possible to use a polylactides-polygloxide sponge as graft in fresh socket after tooth extraction without any elevation of mucousal flaps. A pilot study was conducted to determine whether various bone augmentation materials could be used to preserve the integrity of teeth following tooth extractors with either hard tissue replacement or conventional bone material. It was concluded that these procedures were superior to those performed using membranes because they did not compromise the patient's natural bone structure. Furthermore, there are no reports of success in preserving the original bone volume immediately afterwards. Although many studies exist regarding the effectiveness of immediate implant placement for improving the appearance of new bone, none have been published. For example, histomorphic changes at the extraction site may lead to problems for implanting endosseous prostheses due to defects in the buccal wall."

In this paper, we examine the effects of back school on patients who are suffering from chronic back injury. The results show that both groups have significant improvements in their pain and disability over the course of the first year of treatment. This paper also discusses the use of education to prevent back problems from becoming chronic. We conclude that back schools can be used as an education program because they address both physical and mental health issues."
30657077,"This is a first-in-man study to evaluate the effects of an eight-week exercise program on patients with famiably malformed bowel disease. The results suggest that strength training may be more effective than stretching in improving pain and quality of daily life in patients who have fibromyallygia. In this study, we examine the effect of resistance training on muscle strength and health status in women with fibromyal GiA. We find no significant differences between the two groups; however, there are significant improvements in pain severity and function after treatment."
31140441,"In this paper, we describe a cross sectional study of older adults who presented to the emergency department with no specific complaints. After complete follow-up, two outcome assessmentors judge whether the initial patient is presenting with drug-regular problems and compare their judgment with that of the first patient. This approach will improve communication between trials and epidemiologists in order to better understand how to use biases as an instrument for evaluating treatment effects. The Wente West General Practice Pharmacocist project has been used to improve medication risk management among general practice patients. A focus on this study is to identify and categorize DRPs detectable by pharmacist activities within different general practices. It was commissioned by the WentWest Geriatric Care Improvement program to develop ""system-based riskmanagement theory and action"" research method. These studies were conducted in three primary care settings: home care, the public health center, and 'a private community Pharmacy'. They included 198 elderly patients aged 63 years or older who had lived in the communities during their stay at the hospital. Their regimens were changed from one day to another after discharge. We examined the frequency of readmission across the entire population of patients age 18 and over. Our aim was to assess the effect of integrated medicines management on improved patient safety and quality of life. Furthermore, our intervention was designed to address the threat of drug related issues post-discharge."
25149678,"The purpose of these studies is to determine the effect of a ""home-based, balanced and agility"" exercise program on symptoms among persons aged 50 years with knee OsteoArtritis. Forty four persons were assigned to eight weeks, three times per weekKinesthesia, balance and agile exercises; resistance training, KBA+ RT, or control. After six weeks, no change was observed in pain after exercise cesation. Purpose This study compares the efficaciousness of an aquatic exercise regimen against 'l and /based exercise' in patients with Knee Oarthritises. In addition, there are other measures of quality of life that can be improved by exercise. For example, one study has found that physical activity may prevent falls in older people with osteoarthrits. A second study investigates whether short-term electric shocks combined with active passive motion will improve functional capacity in elderly patients who have been suffering from knee arthritis. It is concluded that this type of exercise does not lead to improvement in their health."

In this paper, we report that the Prodisc II-L patients record improved pain scores and function in comparison to the control group. The results are similar for both groups: P = 0.051, P value 0.0036. This study suggests that smoking does equally well when ProDiscADR is used as a therapy for debilitated  Lumbar Spondyllosis. Intral discal annuloplasty is an effective treatment for painful disc disease because it can improve pain score and pain disability index. It also reduces the need for additional fixation by using two cages instead of one. Back pain is particularly painful due to internal disc dissection. There are several different approaches to treating back pain, including 1) minimally irritated surgical methods 2) intrathecal electrothermal absorption 3) conventional mechanical treatments 4) or ""radiofrequency posterior annullation"". These techniques have not yet been thoroughly studied."

30135903,"This paper focuses on the efficaciousness of patellal taping in subjects with pain control, pain reduction, neuromusculomotion, and knee pain. Its primary aim is to identify predictors for poor recovery at three and twelve months after intervention. Thirteen measures were collected from 310 patients with patelefemoral painful syndrome. The results of these studies indicate that those with poor prognosia are likely to be misguided about their treatment. In this paper, an observational analysis is used to describe proportions of persons with Patellofego pain syndrome with an un favorable recovery over 12 month. A detailed description of the patient's condition is described. Twenty-three patients have been recruited through two rand and ommized trials. They all report good or poor outcome during the first three months of follow-up."
24065550,"This paper presents a controlled trial of physical activity for patients with newly-diagnosed breast cancer. The results suggest that exercise may improve quality of living in the patient's condition, but there are no scientific evidence to support its efficacy. In this study, we examine changes in physical function and qualityof life among women who have been treated for their diseased telomeres. A home-based program is shown to improve health-related qualities of life in breastcancer survivors. We also describe an eight-week swim program for breastcancers as well as other studies on fatigue and sleep."
18682540,"The effect of pharmacists' care on the detection and resolution of drug-retrieval problems in patients with high risk for heart disease was studied. In this study, 69 patients were assigned to either an intervention group or a control groups. After analyzing the results of the patient population, it was found that there was remarkably little difference in the magnitude of reduction in serum cholesterol levels for patients who received lipid- altering pharmacy when clinically trained pharmacist are actively prescribbing and adjusting their drug therapy comparing to other medical practitioners. This study was designed to determine whether there is any significant difference between blood pressure reduction from pharmacist-controlled versus usual care when laboratory-based records are searched. A multi-year prospective trial was conducted at Walter Reed Army Med center of 200 people aged 65 years old taking at least four chronic medications. It was concluded that ""poor medication adherence diminished the health benefits"" of pharmcotherapies. There was no clear evidence for efficacy by lowering lipoproteincholestic levels; there had been deficiencies in its real world application."""
23327448,"This paper focuses on the effects of progressive strength training and megester acetate on older patients with recurrent falls. The study is based on two arms: one group receives low-resistence exercises plus 800mg per day of medicine or bristol, while the other groups receive either exercise alone or in combination with another drug for 12 weeks. In this trial, subjects receive both exercise and medicine for 15 weeks before and after their intervention. Acute falls are tracked continuously throughout the entire trial. After an additional three months follow-up, the results of the study are reported. Failings were also observed continuously during the whole period. To determine whether moderate intensity exercise can be used to prevent falls in elderly people, studies have been performed. However, there has been little evidence that such exercise regimens can improve physical function as well as reduce the rate at which they fall. For example, several studies suggest that vigorous resistance exercise may be effective in preventing falls; however, no further research exists regarding its efficacy."
25345440,"In this study, we examine the effects of three different milk fats on blood lipids. The first is composed of ""R-TFas,"" which are trans fatty alphas and have a negative effect on lipoprotein content. Second is an experiment in which subjects consume three dairy fat diets for four weeks to compare their effects on heart disease. After two weeks, the second group continues to consume butter, dessert cream, and cookies made with only one type of fat. This results in increased levels of transfat in the third group. Finally, after eighteen days, all the subjects continue to drink dairy products that contain 72 g of SFA/2.285 % Ri-Tfa. Eighteened subjects are fed for two consecutive periods of four wk strict control isoenkräftec test dies with 40 percent of energy out of total fat and equal content of cholesterol in rand and ommized studies with crossover design.

28493887,"The purpose of the study is to compare a three-year lifestyle change program against usual care in people with prediabtes. This will be followed for six months and then follow up for twelve months. Since the Diabetes Prevention project has demonstrated that lifestyle changes can reduce the risk by 58 percent, several studies are translating the DPP method into public health friendly contexts. In this study, we examine the effects on fastingblood glucose, insulin sensitivity, body weight, waist circumference, and blood sugar levels in men who are at risk of heart disease. A group-based intervention is used to deliver brief counseling alone or through the Young Men's Council as well as two groups of 692 overweight adults who have been assigned to either diet or exercise regimens; they lose more weight than control groups after 12 months but do not improve their scores on the modified physical performance test. They also report that there is no evidence for changing food habits among overweight women without any other risk factors. Their results suggest that an alternative approach to conventional diets may be more successful in preventing Type 2 diabetes in Latinos because it does not involve large amounts of fat. However, these studies show little effect on improving leptine and aponectin response in elderly men. Although commercial weight reduction programs provide treatment many patients fail to perform well in long-term studies. These studies focus on primary care practices rather than treating patients with obesity. Women over 35 years old are divided into four groups according to their body mass index. One group is assigned one of three different diet strategies: 1) low-fat/high-protein diet; 2) high-carburohydrate diet plus exercise; or 3) no lifestyle change control. After 18 months, all subjects receive the same daily meal replacements except for those with elevated lipoprotein content."
22411372,"A randomized, double-blind study comparing the effects of an eight-week lowcarbody diet to a six-month fast on weight loss in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The results show that subjects on both diets lose more weight than they do on the high-fat diet. Insulinsensitivity is also improved by the low-calbohydrate regimen. Although this study has not yet been published, it does address the issue of whether or not reduced fat or reduced carbogen diet should be used for weight control in type 2 patients."
25472463,"In this study, we compare the effectiveness of two different methods for administering the self-retest instrument, the International Severity Questionnaire, in a controlled trial. The results suggest that both versions have acceptable internal consistency. This paper- and pencil-based version of the instrument is used as an intervention for insomnia. Forty three adults with insomnia complete either version during pre- or post-intervention. For both editions, there are significant differences between scores. Although low response rates among physicians can threaten the validity of surveys, it is possible to use web-delivering technology to increase response rate. We develop if using Web-behavior could increase the respond rate to an international question. After conducting evaluative studies, focus groups, and key informed informant interviews, for whom we used sampling techniques, these studies were further examined. They found that people report lower social anxiety, selfesteem,and social desiration when they were on the World-wide Web or pen and pencil, but that they also report higher social anxieties when their questions were conducted in the real world. Furthermore, participants reported lower levels of social anxiousness whenthey were using the Net than when them were practicing paper instruments. These results indicate that the ""equivalency"" between the two approaches is not necessarily true."

The subjects are divided into three groups and receive either plain Doogh: a py ; dy -- 500 iuv vitamin D plus Calcium-fortify Yoguh; or VD+calcitriol yogurt drink twice per week for 12 weeks. In this trial, sixty subjects were divided between two groups to get either PlainDoogoh ""containing 170 Mg Ca"" and no Vitamin D/150 Ml.. Or B-3-Fortification Yoggh."" A total of 60 subjects had type 2 Diabetes. They were assigned to receive one plain dose of dookh that contained 1,70Mg ca and 500 IuV vitamin EPO. Two groups received placebo but each group received an exercise program including strength, agility, and flexibility. These results suggest that there may be some association between low levels of serum-25H dihydroxyvitamine D and insulin resistance. Furthermore, these patients have significantly different blood concentrations than the placebo group."
32220527,"This study focuses on the mid-term results of standed and anatomical prostheses in patients who have primary osteoarthritis. It is a prospective, observational study to evaluate the effect of preoperative changes in the severity of pain and function after total shoulder replacement with hollow screws. In this study, we examine the relationship between pain threshold and strength at rest and activity during the first two years of follow-up. The results suggest that stemless prosthetics may be more effective than conventional prosthesis for treating primary Ostearthritis. We also investigate the influence of muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration on post-opportunity."
27459705,"The Diabetes Prevention program, or DPP, has been shown to reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes by half in people with prediabtes. However, there is little evidence that this intervention can be delivered in a community setting. In this study, we examine the effects of lifestyle changes on weight loss among overweight adults who have pre-disease and/or metabolic disease. We conclude that an eight-week lifestyle change program can prevent up to half the rate of type 2 epidemics in highrisk populations. This study also describes the costs of its delivery. It shows that it takes more than three years to achieve results."

The children are divided into two classes, according to whether they receive either one or the other type of treatment. In the first group, there is no improvement in survival rates; in contrast, the second group has better survival rate. This study also examines the effect of different types of tooth preparation on the success of glass-Ionomer Cement restorations. It is concluded that this technique will be more cost effective than traditional restorative treatments because it does not involve electrically driven instruments."

This is a prospective, open-label study designed to determine whether or not etancept can be used as an effective treatment for patients who have moderate to severe disease. In this single-blind, random-experimentation study, we assess the efficaciousness of either 25mg twice weekly subcutaneously or placebo in patients suffering from advanced forms of psyllolitic arthritis. We conclude that these patients may be suitable candidates for enzymatic therapy because they are susceptible to tumour necrosus factor alpha, which has recently been shown to be involved in the development of both psoratic and non-spondylitic diseases."

It compares the reliability and validity of the Risk of bias tool with that of an effective public health practice project quality assessment tool, the EPHPP. Both tools assess the methodological quality of twenty-rand and omolized controlled trials. The objective is to determine if household-based exercise intervention is effective as reducing energy consumption and increasing physical activities among Aboriginal families during their pregnancy. In this study, pregnant women were given regular diet counseling, physical activity lessons, and other activities to improve their health. Their mean age was 24.3 years at the end of each treatment period."

We compare two groups of infants: one group receives 15mg/kg of vancomycin every 8 hours; the other group is assigned to receive a placebo solution. All babies were treated with gentamacin sulphfate at least once during their first week of birth. None of these babies developed Necropizing Entrocis. A comparison of bowel colonies and incidence of enterocololitis in newborns admitted to an intensified care unit is described. Neonages of less than 35 weeks gestationally age required mechanical ventilation for respiration distress syndrome were divided into four groups: oral IgGG or oral GentaMICIN. The results of the trial indicate that either group significantly reduces colonization with enterogeneae but does not completely eliminate the risk of developing NEC."

17054174,"In this paper, Lithium is shown to have significant acute antidepressive effects in patients with recurring affective disorders. It also has an effect on menic-depressed patients who are not treated for medical reasons. A double blinded trial of sixty-six depressed females was conducted and the results were very similar between the two groups. The first group received either lithium or imipramin; the second group had more efficacy than either treatment. Forty one out-patients from a history Of at least three attack of depressive disease were rand and ommly assigned to treatment on both sides. After recovery from manic illness, patients receivedither Litium Carbonate or placebo. This proved to be superior to placebo in avoiding relapse: ""The difference in prophylacticefficacy between lithium carbonates and placebo was caused mainly by the lower incidenceof maniic Relapses."" However, these results do not necessarily relate to the actual severity of the patient's condition."

We compare the performance of two different types of gambling tasks: those that test decision-making and those with less severe prefrontal lesions. The results suggest that chronic opioid abusers may be more sensitive to reinforcement values than their non-abusive counterparts. This study also assesses the influence of maintenance treatment on driving aptitude in opioid-dependent subjects. Thirty patients were recruited from an outpatient drug-in-chastity center in Vienna. After receiving synthetic opioid therapy, they were compared with age-matched healthy controls. They were then divided into three groups: 1) chronic amphetesamine/heroism; 2) chronic buprenarephine/methhadone maintenance; and 3) older control subjects without history of substance use.

26923506,"In this study, we examine the nutrient status of overweight premenstrual women and determine whether they lose bone after a moderate weight loss. The results indicate that fat loss is not associated with bone turnover but rather with increased bone mass. We conclude that fish or other oils may at least attenuates these adverse effects. A 15 week controlled feeding study is presented to determine how dairy foods improve central fat and lost weight in overweight and obese subjects. This study focuses on the effect of calcium and vitamin D on weight reduction in elderly women. Forty-two female subjects were divided into three groups: high-protein, high dairy, adequate protein, medium dairy; and inadequate dairy. They were assigned to either diet modification, exercise intervention, or both control groups. After two weeks, all subjects lost body weight and fat. Bone mobilisation, lowered of bone mineral dentition, and Osteporotic Fractures were recognized in post menopausals. Although there are no direct evidence for the role of Ca and Vitamin D in weight management, it is suggested that caloric restrictions can reduce blood levels of these important nutrients."
17636758,"In this first study, we report the results of an extended treatment of 30 children with short- stature who received GH alone or in combination with a growth agonist for three years. After two years, the annual growth rate was significantly higher in both groups than in the control group. Short term administration of human growthogen can improve mean height and predicted adult tallness. Three year's treatment is reported in 121 patients with ""idiotic short statures."" For one year, all subjects are assigned to receive either somatotrophin 0.3mg/kg daily subcutaneously or to be no treatment control subjects. A double blinded, placebo-control trial is performed to determine the effects of long-term growth Hormone treatment on adult height. The efficacy of hypnotism is not yet established; however, it has been used to treat young children without adequate growth hormone. This paper reports that after 1 year of high-dose therapy, hysteria seems more effective in improving height than glutathione."

The aim of this study is to determine whether the efficaciousness of sertriline versus continued Cognitive Behavior Therapy in children and teenagers who do not respond to initial treatment is supported by evidence. This trial was conducted in five different sites in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Children and Adolescence aged 7 to 17 years were divided into two groups: 1) CBT; and 2) exposure and ritual preventive or stressmanagement training. After 24 weeks, patients reandisted to and receiving either intervention had significantly better results. A double blinded placebo-controlled trials showed that fluoxetine did not improve OCD but rather improved it in adults with Major depressive disorder. Although there are few studies on the use of behavior therapy for treating obsessesive-compulsively disorder, these studies have been weaker than those of adults. For example, one study found that behavior counseling could be more effective than medication in treating children with excessive obssessives. Another study examined the safety andefficacy of group cognitive behavior management as compared to sertralines in the long term treatment of pediatric obsessionssal- compulsious disorder."" Concurrently, paroxentine does not seem to be as effective as other antidepressant drugs."

In this study, we found no significant differences in the time or cost of post-surgery care between the groups. We also examined the effect of outpatient therapy after total knee replacement. Forty-six patients received either rehabilitative services from physicians or self-effacing physical therapy by phone calls. The results were similar to those obtained with other treatments. However, additional studies need to be performed on which patients are most likely to benefit. For example, one study reports that patients treated with an early, vigorous, patient-directed rehabilitation program showed better knee function than those treated without such intervention."

A Delphi survey is used to gather consensus on the most commonly used definitions of ""inactive disease"" and ""clinical remission."" In addition, the results from the questionnaires provide an agenda for another conference to reach agreement on unre resolved questions. This approach was initially used by physicians to define clinical renouncement in various forms of juvenile Idiopathicarthritis. Results from surveys were then collected by a consensus-forming technique that reached consensus among several hundred and thirty pr from 34 countries. These standards include no active arthritis, no fever, rash, serosity, or generalize lymphadenpathy attributableto JIA. Children with JJA of any type ages 8-16 years who were invited to b and mized trial compare different exercise treatments participated in two pre intervention sessions of exercisetesting 2 - 6, weeks apart; test-retestreliability was assessed using Type 3, Intrrater Intrclass Correlation coefficient. The objective of these studies was to compare health-related satisfaction between children with Jurienle idicated arthritis and their parents. They found that children's health related satisfaction was better than those reported by parents but that there was also some negative relationship between pain intensity and quality of life. To assess the extent of change in health status within patients with juvenile jatrophic arthritis we examined the child health assessment question naire as well as the Norwegian versions of the Child Well-being Question Observation and the Childhood Health Survey Question Annex. It was concluded that young children had poorer health and slightly improved psychosocial health than controls. We use the coreset of outcome variables to identify if individual patients demonstrate significant improvement. Each patient profile was calculated according to three components: physician global assessmentof disease activity; parent/patient evaluation of overall well being; and functional ability; number of joints With active Arthroplasty; 5 categories of joint with limited range Of motion; 6 erythrate sedimentation rate. Finally, each patient was scored as improving or not improved."

After two weeks of restful sleep, the patients are assigned to either a no-nap condition or one where they spend their entire daily nap time. The results show that both objective and subjective sleepiness are normalized within subjects as compared to prior sleep restriction. This paper discusses the epidemic of concusions in high school and college sports. It uses the case of seven high schools and 27 colleges in which 8905 students attended 7 sports between 1999 and 2000. Concuses were observed in 375 cases. To inform the discussion over whether humans could be chronically deprived without consequences, we conducted ""a dose-responsive chronic sleep restrict experiment inwhich waking neuroBehavioral functions weremonished and matched to those for complete sleep deprimation."" These experiments involve three nights without sleep and three recovery days. Each study involves continuous behavior and medical monitoring."

In this article, we describe the eight Ficit committees who work on the common data base as well as several other measures in order to determine whether falls risk will differ significantly among those reporting recurring falls. We also examine whether executive function can predict falls over two years. This study was designed to compare the functional reach test, timed up or go test with one leg stance test and B-POMAR's balance subtest. A sample of 187 elderly people aged 75-100 were selected from the population of 241 senior housing centers in Japan. After an initial assessment by their residences, they were interviewed for demography, cognition, fall history, use of walking aid, and activitiesof daily living. Aged individuals completed the Activities specific balance Confidence scale, ABC, Berg balance measure, DGI & Timed Up And Go test. Functional Gait Score was used to calculate the concurrent discriminative validity of the Tuga test in healthy older persons.

It uses a combination of PICO, which is used to focus specific questions, and Pubmed, where all results are compared against one another. The aim of this paper is to assess whether air pollution causes asthma onset among children. We selected 217 children who were participating in Southern California Children's Health Study and examined their association with airpollution and respiratory health during the following eight years. In addition, we included 30 cases of new asthma cases as well as two weeks of nitrogen dioxide monitoring outside their home.

A betterunderst anding of factors that affect physical activities will help createeffective interventions aim i ed At increasing time spent outdoors is associate with greater physicalactivity and playground intervention has been shown to increases physical movement in school aged students. There are no pre-school/playground-type intervention studies, but there have been mixed results. Elevation blood pressure is associated with physical exercise in early childhood and at later life. Physical activity is important because it helps to establish habitual habits such as walking and running."
27419040,"This study focuses on the association between childhood weight and school outcomes in a nationally representative sample of children who enter kindergarten in the United States. The results indicate that blacks and Latinos have higher risk of developing childhood obesity than whites, but there is little concluding evidence for this association. In addition, many early-life risk factors for childhood are more common among black women than among white men. Although some studies have suggested that early nutrition may improve later brain structure, few have examined the relationship between diets from birth to age seven. Thus, the purpose of this study is to identify common food trajectories in toddlers as they relate to their pre-baby health status and to examine parental and child-in-class characteristics."

He compares the effect of structured speed dependent treadmill training with limited progressive TTT training on clinical outcomes for patients with acute stroke. The results indicate that the Toughness-Departure Score is superior to the conventional gaits training in terms of overground walk speed, cadence, stride length, and functional ambulation category scores. This study uses the Berg balance scale, the balance subscale ofthe Fugl Meyer test,and the Postural assessment scale for Stroking Patients as measures of patient's health from the acutestage up to 180 day after stroke occurrence. It was found that both measures showed significant floor or roof effects at some points but did not show any change in other outcome measures.

The results are compared with those after laparooscopic adjustable Gastric B and ing. We conclude that there is little evidence for improved health-relational quality at follow-up after weight loss. However, some studies have suggested that these changes may be associated with other characteristics. For example, one study suggests that patients who undergo bariatic surgery lose more weight than those who do not undergo weight reduction. Another study reports that it has been found that people who undergo Roux-En-Y gastric bypass experience greater improvements in their health related to life than they do after conventional medical treatment."

The narrator describes a prospective study in which 134 children were admitted to Madang General hospital between April 1991-October 1993 with an exclusively defined diagnosis of ""ceremal malaria"" and collected blood samples for parasitological assessment. A total of 11.9 p.m. fatality rate was found among these children. Although malnutrition may contribute to risk of death, it is unclear whether this effect is due to undernourished childhood or because of disease caused by malaria itself. This study examines the relation between weight-forage and mortality in ante-posthumous children from three different age groups: 1 -3 years, i.e. 3 to  2 years; b.o.c. &g. All studies contributed information about weight forage, including diarrhea, pneumonia, and all cause deaths. However, only six studies contributing information regarding deaths becauseof measle or fever. Furthermore, none of the studies included any reference to diseases associated with HIV infection. These studies did not have sufficient control over the confounding factors that could lead to changes in child development.

This study investigates the effects of eating sesame over four weeks on postmenopauseal women. Forty female students were assigned to three groups; one group was given an oil for four wk; the other two were given placebos. The results suggest that these studies may have some beneficial effects on human health. In this paper, we examine the effect of using sesamin as compared to fish oil or corn oil on blood-lipid changes in patients with rheumaToid arthritis. We conclude that it is possible that such compounds can induce beneficial changes into risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease."
26269362,"In this study, we compare the effects on body weight of a paleolithic type diet compared to 'a typical Western diet' in patients with Type 2 Diabetes. We examine changes in blood pressure, body mass, and lipids after two consecutive three-month periods. The results indicate that the Paleoliteic diet is more effective than the conventional heart-heathy diet for improving blood sugar levels in subjects with type 2 disease."
21757259,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective observational study in which men with locally-advised CaP were randomized to either immediate or delayed adjuvant therapy. The primary outcome was disease-specific mortality and secondary end points included time to disease progress and quality oflife. We conclude that there is no clear advantage for immediate treatment over delayed intervention when added to long-term ADT in localized prostatecancer. Prostatic patients who have PSA levels between 4.0 and 2 ng./ml are at an increased risk of dying from their disease. Although some patients may have more aggressive disease at diagnosis, they should be treated with active surveillance. This trial has been conducted in several centers in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. It compares endocine treatment with and without radical prostaticide, followed by castingration on progression. After two years of followup, the rate of deaths from prostatic cancer is reported. Men receive annual rectal examination after six years and then undergo transrectal biopsy. Hetopathological reviews of the specimens are performed before surgery. Urinatory PCA-3 score is used to predict the extent of tumor invasion. There is speculation about whether current regimens of pretreatment will improve outcome prediction in cases of advanced or locally advanced patiently advanced prostatecy. However, these studies do not reveal any significant differences in overall survival."
28007054,"In this paper, we describe a new approach to prophylacis for the transrectal-guided needle-pricking procedure. We compare four different schemes of antimicrobial regimens: single dose orally; chloramophicol and norfloxicin 3 days; and no fluoroquilone in three days. The rate of complications was compared by qui-square methods and Fisher method with statistical significance at 95 %. This study is designed to compare the effectiveness of short-term antibiotic treatment with long-lasting anticipatory therapy. It involves patients who have been submitted to an elevated level of prostate disease during the previous two months. Prostate biopsy has become one of the best tests for detection of prostatic disease. However, there is debate as to whether it should be performed with cephalospoin or with fluorinoxic agents. A double-blinded study results in reduction of fever and other urinary tract infection after prostatitious lesions. Men were asked about their pain over the next few days before they had their initial examination. They were also asked how early and late symptoms occurred. Transrectal biopsy is one more popular test for diagnosis ofprostatic diseases. There are disagreements regarding whether use of proscriciaxon or ceftriascan decreases the risk of infections. An international multicentre trial was conducted to determine the incidence of infectious complications after transversely guided prostate biopsy. All men were divided into two grouped: groups 1, which received stant and ard efficacious antibiotics, and groups 2, which got targeted prorophylaxis from rectal culture. Purprisingly, our study included 591 men who had previously undergone triurethral biopsy between January 2011 through June 2015. These patients were excluded from the study because of their pre-existing conditions. Urine cultures were obtained prior to the procedure but were cultured 24 hours before the surgery. Preventive measures were taken against sepisis and tuberculosis. Epidemiological studies were carried out among Medicare patients on active surveillance. Physicians were invited to participate in these studies since they did not receive any indication of serious complications. For example, according to his personal experience, ""prostate cancer"" is the most commonly occurring form of malignant disease in Danish men. He recommends using metrandasol and Ciproflocaci"

The results of this study indicate that the minimal change in gaits speed for people post-stroke is not significant, but rather important. It is possible that patients with stroke may be able to return to their previous level of function after training with an advanced form of motion-retrieval technology. In this paper, Kim and his co-workers describe how they use telepathy to improve walking performance in patients suffering from chronic strokes."
21154393,"A prospective, randomized, double- blinded study is designed to assess the efficiacy and safety in patients with severe depression who have not responded to an appropriate trial of antipsychotics. In this study, we examine the effects of quitia pine Xr as monotherapy for Major Depressive disorder. The results indicate that it is more effective than placebo in improving depressive symptoms in subjects with no response to either treatment. This was followed by a further study on quetitiin fumarate as an augmenter to antidepressedant therapy in major depressant disorders. It was found that there were significant improvements in the severity of both groups over time."
28502570,"In this paper, the authors describe a comparison of two patient-specific guide-based instruments to improve the accurateness of the knee arthrostry. The first is an attempt to compare the accuracy of patient specific instrumentation with that of conventional instrumentations in determining whether the use of these newer instruments can be used to reduce the risk of injury and length of post-surgery. This study also focuses on the relative merits of different patient devices for improving the precision of both surgical and non-surgical approaches to total knee replacement. Although there are some differences in the degree of accuracy between the two groups, it is clear that one type of device will outperform the other in terms of overall accuracy."

We compare the efficaciousness of PPS to placebo in treating interstitial Cystitis patients. The results of four patients who received P PS gained significant  symptomsatic relief comparing with two receiving placebo. Purpose This study focuses on the use of intragesical baciluscalmette-guirein as an adjuvant to the treatment of patients with ""refractory"" orphaned interstrutial disease. Thirty female patients met the National Indian Arthritas, Diabetes, Digestive And Kidney diseases criteria for convulsions and were randomed in doubleblind fashion into two groups each consisting of fifteen patients to receive 6 weekly instillations from either group. Periodic Questionnaires upon symptoms of interspersed cystitis was obtained."
28052845,"This paper describes a novel approach to decision-making in public health that uses theory, causal models, and past observations to help make informed decisions. It is based on the concept of ""salt reduction,"" smoking cessations, gardening, mental health, weight loss, or lifestyle change. In this paper, we describe an intervention for pregnant women who have gestational type 2 diabetes with impaired glucose control. We examine changes in body weight, blood pressure, fasting sugar, postpran and ieal blood glucose, insulin resistance,blood pressure and cholesterol. The results are similar to those reported in other studies. Women with previous Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus receive conventional dietary advice but do not respond well to lifestyle changes. These include diets that lower their glycanemic index and increase their body fat. A study has been conducted to compare effects of two different types of weightloss regimens: one designed to prevent overweight people from developing Type 2, and another designed specifically to reduce the severity of Type 1 disease in men with IGT. Both were found to be more successful in preventing Type 2-disease than they were in controls."
32271148,"This study focuses on the use of short-messages to improve blood control in patients who have uncontrolled hypertensives. It is a pilot study that consists of two groups: one group uses short messages to encourage patient engagement; the other group employs self-management tools designed to increase blood pressure control. The results of the first group are mixed, with some patients receiving more attention than usual care and others receiving less attention. In this second group, patients receive weekly phone calls from pharmacists to help them improve their blood health. A further study examines the impact of an education-based lifestyle intervention on blood management among patients with chronic disease."
26315934,"Brain Snack: executive function is a common psychological disorder that affects both children and adults. It's important to note that there are some limitations to the use of medication in this population because of the inconsistent results on these tests. For example, one study found that treatment with stimulant medicine improved executive functions in patients with ADHD but not in those with other forms of mental health problems. Brain Scandal: In this paper, we examine the relationship between early language development and autmatic-like traits in middle-aged children. Sixteen young children meeting Diagnostic Criteria for attention-doing disorder with hyperactivity were tested on drug or placebo. They showed significant improvements in learning, academic performance, and self- correcting behavior. This study was an effort to gather more information about the long- term history of attention deficit hyperactivation disorder. We looked at the follow-up period from 13 to 18 years and examined the differences in the severity of symptoms, antisocial personalities, drugs, etc."

Both groups take place in public schools for typical-developing children. A prospective study comparing pre-schoolchildren with an autistic spectrum disorder to those receiving conventional treatment is conducted. For forty-four children between the ages of 23 and 53 months, all but two groups receive treatment at EIB. At follow up, there are no significant differences in language, play, or severity of disease. Early intervention does not cause increased problems for mothers or father"
29553824,"In this study, we investigate the effects that flavanolil-rich black chocolate has on endometrial and platelets function in patients who have congestive heart failing. We compared the effect of coconut-free control dark chocolate with those of conventionally available ""flavanol rich"" chocolate for improving blood pressure, insulin resistance, and other measures of vascular function. The results suggest that consumption of both types of chocolate may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in healthy subjects. A cross-over trial is performed to assess whether antioxidants, anti-irritated, or other cardioprotective effects are achieved when either type of food is consumed. Thirty middle-aged men and women were divided into three groups: one group was assigned to consume only water; another was given an equal amount of fat; and then two groups were assigned different amounts of fiber. Both groups showed significant increases in serum lipid concentrations as well as changes in inflammation. This study examines the benefits of drinking high-fat chocolate on fasting blood sugar levels, total cholesterol, but also on adrnocortic excretion after sleep loss. It was found that these diets resulted in increased triacylglul concentration over time, which was not affected by any change in inflammatory marker. Flavanone-containing chocolate reduced faster blood glucose levels while increasing blood vessel function at low-glyceic index. Another study examined the efficaciousness of daily eating of cocoa's flavonoids on plasma lipoprotein profile in mild hypercholestemia. Twenty-five young healthy adults were recruited at pre-primary care setting. They received three experimental meals in order to receive either 200 mg polyphenol powder or 100 g white choca bars. No significant group interaction was observed between the neuropsychlogical, hematicological, norblood pressure variables examined. Fatigue and fatigue were measured by mini mental state examination, trail making test A and B. Brain Snack: Many studies indicate that cacao can help prevent heart disease because it contains flavonoidics. Some studies have reported that caffeinous foods such as chocolate might be associated with reductions in blood flow and dilation. However, there has never been much evidence regarding the beneficial effects of long-term indulgence. Consumpation of flavanoid-enriched chocolate seems to improve blood vessels. One study suggests that short-lived consumption could increase blood circulation. Two"

27247216,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficaciousness and safety of single-aggressive gemcitabine combined with capecitabe in patients with natively advanced pancreatical disease. In this trial, a dose-escalation strategy was used to determine whether it was possible to deliver stereotactically bodyradiation to patients who had locally advancedpancreatic disease without significant risk of toxicity. A multi-centre, doubleblind, placebo-control study was conducted to assess the impact of an institution's multidisciplinary practice on the care recommended for localized or metastatically advanced malignancies. It was concluded that gemcitebine plus capeffibilib improved overall survival when compared to standard treatment for advanced pardoned panceratic cancer. This paper also reports results from another large, well-controlled trial using gene transfer against pancratic tumors. These results suggest that novel agents may be more cost-effective than conventional treatments for these patients."
24589525,"This study focuses on the use of pre-clinical mobility limitation concepts to predict early-stage disability in older people. It is a population-based prospective study using 266 elderly women who are free of physical or mental limitations at the time of baseline. The outcome measures were incident mobility disability Within 18 months, defined as ""self-reported difficulties walking 0.8km, climbing 10, steps / or transferringfrom or into 'a car or Bus'"". In addition, it was used to examine the predictive validity for pre clinical mobility limit with respect to later-life risk of manifestmobility. A multifactorial approach was employed to identify frailtiness Components and to determine whether fatigue in daily activities was associated with initial onset of severe mobility handicap. These results suggest that exercise may be an effective preventative measure against future falls among older adults."
29059584,"Pregnants in India are asked to take iron from a weekly regimen rather than daily doses. This study compares the side effects of iron-supplementing with their impact on pregnancy compliance among women in Bangladesh. Women were assigned to either weekly or daily dosages of 2x 60mg iron, one tablet each week morning and evening or 1x1x60mil iron every day. Fifty centers were assigned to prescribe either Weekly or Daily supply regimen. In this study, pregnant women were divided into two groups: Arm A/B arm and Arm B arm. The first group received bovine lacttoferin for iron treatment while the second group was given ferrous spifate. Both studies showed an increase in haeglobin concentration during the first eight weeks of treatment. These results suggest that routine iron supplementation is not only important for maternal health but also for improving pregnancy outcomes."

The authors aim to identify the risk factor and predictors associated with surgical site infection as it pertains to patients who undergo elective spine surgeries. This study is aimed at determining whether preoperative and post-operative patient characteristics are related to an increased risk of surgicalsite infection after spine procedures. It also aims to determine whether there is any association between preoppressive status and complications following spinal surgery; furthermore, Wotelebaum concludes that ""preoperatively deficient"" patients have higher risk than those who do not have such conditions."

It compares the success of two different methods: 1) using an open-irriggated balloon; and 2) using conventionally guided catheters. In this study, we examine the efficaciousness of both methods for paroxysmal atrial fibrilation as well as long-term results. We conclude that these approaches are superior to conventional methods because they do not involve multiple lesioned delivery at risk of serious complications."

The aim of the study is to determine whether two restorative materials can be used to inhibit the growth of artificial rootcaries. This work is a first attempt at evaluating the effects of these two different materials on tooth growth. It was found that the use of three restreative systems could lead to reductions in the rate of bone loss in patients who were treated with one of them."
26951286,"This paper focuses on the use of daily doses of vitamin D to improve health in older adults. In this study, we compare the effect of 15 or 100mcg per day on biochemical response and sense of well-being in a double blinded, randomed trial. The results suggest that levels of 25HhD may be inversely related to acute respiratory infections. We hypothergeate that these levels may have an association with acute fractures. Furthermore, our study shows that children with severe pre menstrual syndrome are at greater risk of falling than those with normal blood levels. Our aim is to determine the frequency of falls among older people in nursing homes and to identify the influence that level of Vitamin D may lead to. A population-based, doubleblind controlled trial was performed for six hundred sixty- seven women in lowlevel care and nine52 women who were high-level Care. Serum-25H HD levels and recognized risks factors for falls included current medication use, history of previous breaks, weight, height, mental function, walking ability, and frequencyof going outdoors were calculated. Brain Snack: Many observational studies report that there is some evidence that supplemental calcium can reduce the risk from common diseases such as fracture and cancer. However, interventional trials do not find any benefit in improving mental health; however, many studies conclude that it is important to maintain adequate supply of both alkaline and mineral forms of ""vitamin D"" because they provide protection against disease."
22895977,"This study focuses on the effects of two rest breaks and four stretching exercises on workers' symptoms. Workers are assigned to either an intervention or a conventional group, and they perform their usual work tasks for four weeks. The results show that there is remarkably little difference in pain severity between groups. A new device called the hip belt has been shown to reduce back pain and neck pain among apple harvest workers. In this study, all workers are given one-week rest periods with no other scheduled breaks. However, subjects change their schedules after each shift so that they can alternate between different types of breaks: 1) conventional breaks; 2) supplementary breaks -- which do not contain any break; and 3) regular breaks without additional breaks during the first part of the shift. Lateral and médiandylitis caused by work activity is common upper-arm musculodyskeletal disorder with prevalence of 4-25 percent depending upon the job setting anddiagonetic criteria. Methods were then used to predict the extent of persistent elbow tendoitis as well as the influence of medical history, psychosocial factors, older age, lower perceived decision power onthe job, etc. After 12 months, patients were divided into two groups according to whether they received an ergonomics training program or another type of treatment. They were asked to report their symptoms before and after receiving the intervention. There was significant differences in both groups at week 16 and 11 weeks after the trial. These differences were described in terms of how many patients had varying degrees of pain from injury. Muscle Learning therapy was recommended to prevent repetitive lifting but did not have great efficacy. An alternative mouse and/or forearm supports board were studied to determine whether it would improve the incidence of neck and shoulder injuries among office workers who use these devices. It was found that the mice improved the frequency of complaints and the severity of discomfort within the control group. Furthermore, there was also evidence that those using the alternative boards showed greater satisfaction with them than those who didn't receive such support."

30060614,"In this paper, Barlow and Anderson discuss the association between sweetened beverages and risk of Type 2 diabetes in a French population. They conclude that consumption of sugarsweetened drinks is associated with increased risks of type 2 disease but less than other studies have examined the effect of artificially sweetnessed beverages on blood levels of urc acid and liver enzymes. The effects of high ficose or fructoses are not well studied; however, they may be useful as markers of nonalcoholic fat-hepatic disease. This study examines the relative affects of four different sweeteners: medium fructogene at 40g/day, high glucose at HG & high sucrose at 80g per day. It was found that these subjects were more likely to gain weight than those who consumed only moderate amounts of fruit juice. Furthermore, barlow's results suggest that drinking large quantities of alcohol can lead to changes in body weight. He also suggests that excessive consumption might increase the risk for developing Type 2, especially among African American females because it increases their susceptibility to obesity."

29954184,"Heart failure is one of the leading causes of heart failure, and telemedicine has been shown to improve care for patients with this condition. In this paper, we describe a study that compares the effectiveness of home-telemonitory technology in improving patient outcomes in patients who have recently been hospitalised with heart failing. We conclude that home based tiration can be used to reduce readmmissions in older adults with congesive heart fail. This study also describes if e-mailing or remote  Telemedical management will result in reduced death from any reason. The results of this study are as follows: 1) 710 patients were assigned either nurse telephone support or usual care by 1:1 ratio; 2) 128 patients had mild to moderate decompensations; 3) 307 days were spent in follow-up; and finally 4) 331 patients received weekly voice response calls about their health status.

21817143,"In this study, we compare the efficaciousness of telmalan 80mg and valstenan 160 mg in patients with Type 2 hypertension. The results suggest that these two drugs are superior to one another in improving blood pressure control. We also examine the effect of angiotin-converting Enzyme Inhibition on the development of Type 1 diabetes mellitateus. A double blinded parallel group study was conducted for nine sites in university hospital and urban centers throughout the U.S. Patients were assigned either to receive either continuous placebo treatment or celiplorol as first line treatment. After four weeks of singleblind placebotreatment, patients had reduced their diastoplic bloodpressures from 95/114 mmhg to 105/115 mpHg. Perindomepral enerbumine was evaluated in 28 patients who had been treated with hypertensively. Two hundred uncomplicatelyhypertensed patients received either continued placebo therapy or climazapril at a daily dose of 1.75, 2.25 or 5 mg per day. At the conclusion of eight weeks, SBP/Dbp values were reduced by 12 months with perindopil than with any other drug alone. This study investigates the effects of combination therapy of amlofdipine and vasartan on endotomy dysfunction in diabetic patients. Both treatments decrease blood flow and increase the urinaryalbumin excresion rate. These studies show that both agents can be effective in relieving hyper tension. Blood pressure is important because it determines whether strokes will occur among hypertentsive and not hypotensesive individuals. Although there is some uncertainty about the effectiveness of antihypersive agents, they have been used widely in treating hypertrophic disease. Some physicians recommend only monotherapies such as aldosterics and calcium channel blocks but others use more potent approaches. For example, nitric acid has been shown to reduce blood vessel activity. However, no evidence exists regarding its safety."
31182084,"This study focuses on the use of a new decision support system to improve blood pressure control among Indian patients. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of two different approaches: 1) an alerting system that uses real-time patient interaction to guide treatment decisions; and 2) an algorithmic approach that takes into account multiple aspects of the patient's condition and then uses machine learning to predict how well the system will be used. In this paper, we examine the effects of both alerters and decision supports in treating hypertension with greater accuracy than expected. We conclude that these methods are not effective for improving care because they do not involve active intervention."

The subjects are assigned to either receive 15 g of ca/d or 1500 mg calcium/day in addition to their normal diet for eight weeks. This is an interventional study that involves two groups of patients: one group receives 25 hydrovitamin D at 75 nmol-L and the other group gets 500 pg Ca/D. We conclude that these studies have not been well designed because there are many gaps in the international dietary recommendation for vitamins D in elderly women. A double blinded placebo-controlled pilot study shows that older women with adequate levels of blood pressure can benefit from taking standardized amounts of both forms of alpha-lipoic polysaccinate.

They use solitary enteral jejanostomy as an alternative and then compare the results of six weeks of daily feeding with those of conventional care. The aim is to determine whether early enterals nutrition improves survival in patients who have undergone major surgery. A parallel- group, multi-center, double blinded, R and Omized, controlled trial was performed in 150 adult men after gastrointestinal or vascular resection. After bowel rsection for gastric cancer, there is not consensus on which type of food should be used. Enteral feed has been used more frequently but does not appear to improve patient health. Preoperative fasting reduces blood sugar levels and increases insulin resistance. This study investigates the effect of carbohydrate rich drinks on post-elective laparcotomies. It is concluded that these drinks may improve recovery during elective open gallbladecystry."

The subjects were divided into two groups: control group and MPH group. They performed elicitation of their EgG at different stages of training. In this paper, we examine the relative alpha power as predictr of treatment outcome. We also develop an Antidepressedant Treatment Response Index using Eego parameters assessed at base and week 1 for each patient. Rationality Both psychotropic drug and mental disorders share typical signatures from electroencephalographs. A recent study suggests that some drugs have Efergic effects opposite to those of the mental illnesses treated with these medicines. Two conventional antipsychos, chlorpromazin and halopridol, and four ""atypical antipileptics"" are studied in healthy volunteers. These studies investigate whether the key - lock principle applies to the use of electrodes when treating patients with epilepsy. For example, twenty-three adult subjects with complex partial seizures took stable dosesof bupropionhydrochloride. Twenty- three adult patients suffering from difficult-tocontrol complex parieval seizures were recruited to underwent two EEEG recording sessions; one for every drug. Thirteen normal subjects received seven Eeck recordings sessions, one after each drug dosage equivalent of1m haloperiddola."

We conclude that surgery induces weight Loss but does not lead to improved quality of life. Although there are few studies on long term outcomes for either technique, it is believed that they will offer similar weight losses. There is debate whether the ""laparoscopic fixed gastic imbrocation"" offers similar type of weight lose when compared against the conventional methods of bariatic surgery. These studies suggest that surgeonly induced change may be effective in treating Type 2 diabetes. However, these studies do not show any improvement in control of glyceremia, blood pressure, or cholesterol."
28829161,"In this paper, the authors describe a long-term study of extremely preterm premature infants. They compare the duration and severity of their parenteral feeding with that of an exclusively human milk diet. The results are similar to those of other studies. For example, in this study, mothers who were not given breast milk during the early pregnancy period were more likely to experience severe morbidities than babies who received only donor milk. This study determines the initial maternal costs of providing 100 milliliters of mother's milk per day for prematurely weighed infant girls during hospitalization. It also uses multiple analysis methods to assess the cost effectiveness of different feeding strategies. A 100 % animal-based Hmf was used as compared to 105 mL from 111 pregnant women who had been provided by these very low-birth-women. These comparisons were made using the risk of necrotizing Enterocolitis at 24 months after birth."
29523009,"This study focuses on the association between blood levels of phyloquinonine, a known anti-disease agent, and the risk of Type 2 diabetes in humans. The results suggest that phosphorus may be an effective preventative measure against type 2 disease. In this study, we examine the relationship between serum concentrations of both Phylloquine and Osteopulgerin, as well as the effects of vitamin K1 on bone loss. We conclude that these two compounds are associated with increased susceptibility to Type 2, but little is known about their efficacy."
22439920,"African Americans suffer from disproportionately high blood pressure and complications, but little evidence exists for improving their control. A mixed-primary care approach is used to improve patient health in this population. The primary care physicians are assigned different arms of patients with Type 2 diabetes: usual care only, nurse case manager, community health worker, and nurse cases manager. This group receives web-based management; the other arm receive regular care. In addition, they have an annual Diabetes Assessment program that includes assessment of Hba1c, blood sugar, lipoprotein measurements, smoking, retinal photographs, urinemicroalbumin, foot examination, etc. These studies assess the effects on self-care as well as quality of care over one year. American Diabetes Association's Guide to Self-Management for Older Women has been adopted by several churches in North Carolina. Although it does not reduce hospital visits or emergency room visit, it appears that older women may be more likely to adjust to their disease than traditional treatment. An eight-week telephone intervention was shown to help older females manage their own condition. It also improved both physical activity and psychological adjustment. Two physician learning approaches were developed to increase safety and qualityof diabetes care provided by primary doctors. Physicians received no intervention except a ""simulated case"" based physicianlearning intervention. Dependent variable included A1 C values, LDLcholations, risky prescribebing events.

Translation of these two approaches takes place in three separate groups: 1) general medical practice 2) internal medicine practices 3) rural communities 4) federally qualified health centers. Each group had at least one patient with type 1 diabetes. They were divided according to age, gender, severity of disease, duration of illness, frequency of follow-up visits, number of laboratory test results, cost per patient, length of observation, time spent waiting for response to calls, amount of time taken to write letters, how many nurses attended each day, whether or not there were any complaints about care, what happened to the patients' health status after the intervention, who did not receive adequate care during the trial period, whereabouts of service, when asked questions, why they visited, whom they saw, reviews of"
17329131,"The present study focuses on the effects of an exercise program for patients with moderate to severe intermittent clausdication. It is a novel approach to improving walking performance in these patients. In this paper, we examine the effect of strength training on walking ability and blood flow in patients who are not able to walk easily due to their leg pain. We conclude that there is little evidence of any benefit from strength-training or other exercises in relieving pain caused by chronic intermittent bowel disease."
28135725,"The aim of this study is to determine whether blood pressure variability in the European elderly can be used as a predictor of outcome over and beyond levels of severity. In this trial, we divided 4695 patients aged 60-80 years into two groups: active treatment or match placebo. We assessed whether on-treat systelic bloodpressure level, visit-To-visit Variance independent of the means VIM or within-Visit Varity, predicted total; n = 2686 mm Hhg; Mortality or cardiovascular endpoints; or cerebrovascular end points. At 2 years, mean between group differences were10.5 mHg No adverse effects upon brain function has been detect during the first nine months of treatment with thiazde diuretics or an alpha blocker of moderately high blood tension in tidal hypertension. This study also included studies that examined quality of life for elderly patients with severe hypotension who were assigned either by age or by their physical condition. These studies showed no signs of depression or fatigue after 6 months. A further study was performed in which six hundred older patients were allocated to either antihypertinel therapy or another type of drug. After three months, they completed both trailmaking tests and four subassessments from the Self-Assesment Profile. The results of these studies indicate that there is no association between lower blood stress levels and better well-being. Another study investigated the efficacy of nictriphine in elderly subjects. It was found that it reduced the risk of fatal or unfatal stroke but did not increase the chance of death. There are other studies suggesting that treating mildly elevated blood forces people to have more mental health than usual. Antihypersive drugs may reduce the risks of heart attack and stroke in older adults. Although many studies have suggested that controlling blood flow to low thresholds may lead to an increasedrisk of falls and injuries, little evidence exists regarding the effect of such control."
28107576,"This study aims to compare efficacy between topical creams and lidocasine cream in pain control and side effects. The results of this study indicate that topicals can be used as an effective treatment for painful leg veins. A novel, non-ablative pulsed dye lance is shown to be more effective than the other two methods. In this paper, we examine the effect of cold air cooling on pain during hair removal. We conclude that changes in the cooling duration of the diode or alex laser will have different effects on both pain and epideral damage. Our aim is to determine how well these changes are associated with patient-determined indications of clinical importance. Two different types of topically anestics are described: 1) a novel peel that is applied directly to the skin before full-face electroderination; and 2) another device that uses an evacuate chamber to induce skin compression and triggers tactile nerve receptors inthe skin. These studies provide evidence that ""changes"" in acute pain measures are most strongly related to 'clinician-regarded differences'. For example, when patients report their pain at 100 mm, they give them very little relief. Another method of anesthesia involves using cryogen spray chilling to ablate portwine stain. Although it is not possible to use such cooling, there are disadvantages to its use. Cold air cooling has also been found to reduce pain caused by needle wounds because of its high cost. Finally, our goal here was to evaluate whether topicall anesthesies can improve pain management in patients with congenital malformations who suffer from scarring."

The Hamilton Depression Rating Scores are used to predict the severity of depression in patients with major or severe depression. Alpra soliloquy is described as being ""at least as effective"" as imiprimine in relievating depressive symptoms; however, side effects are rare. A double blinded study compares the efficaciousness of two triazolomebenzodiazecines in treating patients suffering from Major Depressive disorder. Both drugs produce significant improvements in both severity and duration of treatment. However, some patients experience withdrawal reactions during the last half-life of the drug."

They conclude that these studies are likely attributedal and motivated by observational biases."
29573132,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to bonding three universal or multiple-mode adhesive systems onto dentin. They employ an ""all-bond universal"" system, which is superior to conventional adhesives in its strength and ease of application. The authors compare the strength of the two systems to that of other adhesive materials, such as self-etchers and etch-and-reinse methods. This paper presents ten experimental groups of four different types of sealants, each of which has at least two teeth affected by caries. After 24 hours of water storage, sticks are bonded with cross sectional areas of about 0.8mm2, then they are tested for their strength against tooth-bite size."

Specifically, the cows were assigned an assessment of their body condition score and valor score as well as other risk factors. This paper also describes the development of a ""lameness control program"" for hens on dairy farms. It is based upon the analysis of dangers and critical controls points HACCP; however, it is generally ineffective because of failure to implement such an intervention. A two-year experiment on claw trimming affects hoof health in Swedish dairy herdas. In autumn trim, cattle were blocked according with breed composition and parity and treated with either autumn trimming or no autumn cutting. Cows within each Herd were block according to breed size, parities and stage of Lactation, and allocated to 2 treatments: autumn shaving or not autumn pruning. Outcomende variables were cackle lesions, claw length, body conditions score,parity, days inmilk, milk production,and reproductive records throughoutthe previous and subsequentlactation period."" These studies are particularly important since they do not involve comparisons between individuals or groups of individuals but instead use random samples from different sources. They include measures of body weight and sole soft tissues thickness. Lamelessness is one of the most severe welfare problems in dairy farming. There are several studies that have investigated effects of oral Biotin on risks of lemming. One field study has been conducted to examine effect of paracy and duration of biotinning on white line diseases. Although there is no significant effect, these studies suggest that lamehood increases the risk of dying or becoming culled during lactating Hostesses. Another study investigates the association between breast condition scores and milk yield."

It is a prospective observational study in which newborns with high birth weight receive either ranitidine or omeprasole for gastric emptyation. The results indicate that the rate of infectious diseases, Necrotic enterocotis, mortality, as well as other risk factors were not significantly different from controls. In part one, 100 consecutive babies were treated in an acute care unit; in part two, 89 gastrocopied and Mechanically Ventilated infant subjects were prospectively evaluated for more risk factor for Gastric mucoses. Stress ulcer prothrolaxis using rantidine has been associated by an increased risks of ventilator acquired pneumonia.

For this purpose, the following parameters were calculated: amnimotic fluid features, funiculaire blood pH / Apgar indexat 5 min ', neonatial weight, body length, Gestational age,and the presence of others pathologies. These values were determined according to the severity of Ugb within 4 days after delivery. Heterotrophic lesions were frequently found in preterm children. However, these conditions were rarely observed in premature babyhood. To determine the effect on acidity production in hypochlorhacia patients, proton pump inhibiting therapy was used. Thus, it was possible to treat premature child with reflux disease. Furthermore, there was no association between histamine 2 receptor antagonists and the incidenceof Necrizing Enter Olitis in infant aged 401 to 1500 g."

In this study, patients with major Depressive disorder were treated for 6 weeks with either paronoxetine or clomolpramin. After the initial treatment, no responders were terminated. This 8 week, doubleblind study compares efficacy against that of venilafaxine on primary care patients who have major depressive disorders. The mean change from base to endpoint was 2.1 points for patients treated by escialopram n = 14 versus dulacerine p a  05. To test the hypothesize that in patients without major depression, the response will differ for both regimens; however, it is assumed that these predictors will not be as accurate as those found in ""real world"" patients. A recent attempt to imput missing data in studies has been criticized because it leads to substantial bias among estimators and testing methods. However, using the Mixed Effect Model repeating measures approach has proved to be superior to other approaches."
21143921,"This study focuses on the effect of a four-week balance training program on older women's balance during one year. The results are promising, but there is still much unrequited knowledge about how this type of training can be used to improve balance in older adults. In this paper, we examine the effects that weight shift training has on patients with stroke and compare it to conventional physical therapy. We conclude that both methods have significant positive effects on balance function. A new device called SmartStep has been developed to track the location of body weight in real time."
22023891,"In this chapter, Dr. Rivers discusses the use of a systematic review approach to assess the evidence on prognostics in stroke patients. He uses an observational study of Forty-One patients who had been attending an inpatient Stroke Rehabilitation unit for 17 days after their initial stroke. The results showed that there were no significant changes in upper limb function between the time of injury and recovery. This study also examined the effect of stroke location upon motor recovery by comparing healthy subjects with patients with acute disease. It was found that lesion size did not predict whether they would recover or not. A prediction model was developed to predict the degree of recovery at six months."
29793007,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the concept of ""miniscence-ly important difference"" and uses it to predict whether patients with complex pain syndrome can be improved. He describes a two-week trial in which 181 patients were treated with morphine before and after treatment for pain intensity. The mean relative pain reduction was calculated for each patient at different time intervals. This study is an attempt to determine whether changes in pain are truly meaningful from the patient's point of view. Although there are several measures used to measure pain severity, the most important change is measured by the minimum clinical importance difference. For example, when asked to rate pain intensity, only those who have experienced significant pain improvement appear to be more likely to improve. However, these results are not entirely reliable because they do not take into account the degree of change that occurs over time or due to treatment."

In the first year, the mean height speed increases from 4.7 to 4.3 cm; the rate of bone maturity declines from 2 to 3 months. This study concludes that two years of growth hormone treatment improves heightprognosis for children who have short stature after IUGR therapy. A further study investigates the effects of early growth Hormone treatment on infants withprader willi Syndrome.

This trial uses telemedicine to deliver an evidenced-based lifestyle intervention designed to help women lose their weight."
29279934,"This trial compares the effect of daily treatment to vitamin D for one year on blood test of vitaminD status. The results demonstrate that daily 4500 IU of ""vitamin D"" is required to attain blood levels associatedwith lowest disease risks, and this should be tested as part of future studies for fracture prevention. In this study, elderly people aged 66 years or older were randomly assigned to either 1,800 mg of calcium citric or placebo every two years. Bone dentition did not change between the two groups; however, it declined significantly in both groups. Adenomas are more common in older people than in the community-dehling older population. Calcium has been reported to prevent colorecopal adenomes but does not improve bone mineral density among these patients. Osteophilis and related fragileity fractures constitute 'a serious and world-wide public health problem'. To determine how much each dose of meth and Ienone will reduce the riskof fracture in women who have one or more high risk factors, we perform an eight-section brocade exercise trial. It was found that the modified eight section Brocade improved the symptoms andindices associated with Osteoporoseis in Postmenoppausal women.

The results show that there is a significant improvement in blood glucose levels after 6 months in both groups. Telemedicine has been used to improve care for older patients, but it is not proven to be as effective as routine care. In this study, we examine the effects of an interdisciplinary approach to patient management using advanced medical informatics and technology. We describe two different approaches: 1) telemonitory treatment; and 2) remote patient reporting via'mobile telephone'. One group receives regular care while the other follows conventional regimens. A1c values are reduced at 12 months from IB to IIB. Both groups have improved their health status over time. There is no difference between the control group except for HbA 1c which decreases from 7.35 percent to 6.97 percent during the intervention period. Another study uses standardized self-monitorring of blood sugar to assess the effect of short-time real-timing continuous glucose monitoring. It is shown that long-term changes in haemoglobin can be achieved by changing the timing and frequency of measurements."

It uses a six-year change in continuous scores to predict future heart disease and cardiovascular disease among 12,866 patients free of type 2 or other diseases. The results suggest that significant change is able to better predict both future and chronic heart failure than dichotomiemous categorizing factors. In addition, it suggests that increased exercise capacity increases the relative risk of death from all three risk factors: obesity, age, and high blood pressure. Although there are no studies using exercise stress tests as predictors against stroke, this study aims to determine the association between exercise heart rate recovery and mortality in men without history of coronary chest disease."

This paper also discusses the importance of methodological challenges in research in social communication in Autism Spectrum disorders. A meeting was held at the National Institute's of Health in November of 2002 about methods ological challenge of research regarding psychosocial intervention in autistic patients. There were several small studies suggesting that early approaches for social communication could be effective but little is known how and why they work. Children with high-resources were assigned to either parents-medicated or community-cared-out treatments. Parents were given different types of training depending on their level of severity. They were then divided into two groups: group-parent-Mediated Communication-Folk/Autismatic; and group family-Memory-Induced Intervention. Both groups showed significant improvements in joint engagement and joint behavior. These findings support the notion that there may be some type of temporal ordering in the process of therapy."

The results are similar for both groups. A further study was performed on overweight patients who had Type 2 Diabetes. In this paper, we describe the effect of ""low-carbidohydrate"" diets on blood pressure, body weight, and other measures of health. We conclude that these studies have not yet been published."
27545902,"This study aims to improve bone mineral denition in childhood patients with acutely severe leukemia. It is a double blind, placebo controlled trial that focuses on improving the bone health of young adults who have been treated for their disease. The results indicate that there is an association between low-dentalized bone and male gender, white race, and cumulative doses of 500mg of glucotoroids. This population is at high risk for late complications from treatment due to increased blood levels of malignancy. In this paper, we discuss the concept of ""survival health and resilience education"" and how it can be used to promote improved health behavior among childhood cancer survivors."
25122666,"The aim of this study is to determine the association between ankle brachiase score and mortality in symptomatic patients with pad. We examine the effect of walking time on risk of death among patients who have lower leg strength. A prospective, observational cohort of 410 patients aged 55-years was followed for 60 months. This population used an ankle-brachial index as a predictor of mortality."
25957185,"The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of a combination of adjuvenient cispral-based chemotherapy and observation in patients with "" completely resected"" stage IB, II, or III non-smal cell lung cancer. In this paper, we report results from two phase III trials that confirm the safety of concurrent chemoradation and post-operavation for patients who have ""pathologically stageded T1 -- 2,N1 - 2, n = 3."" We conclude that these studies are inadequate because they do not include adequate tumor staging. This study was designed as an rand and ommized blinded two-armed trial with operation and abjuvant chemistry in one arm; versus surgery and adjusvant mitoicillin C, vinblastines, and Cisplatin in the otherarm. The primary outcome was overall survival. A total of 242 patients underwent either procedure or surgery. After complete subsection, patients were assigned to either three or four cycle of citoradiothérapie or to observation. They had remarkably good survival after surgery among all their patients."
30244208,"A prospective study of 30 hips receiving a collum-femorus-preserving stem was performed. The results showed that the short stem preserved bone mineral density and improved the stability of total hip replacement. Short stems were also used in this study because they did not interfere with the proximal iliac bone stock. This study furthermore investigated whether it was possible to reverse the offset of the prosthesis using an alphashort stem instead of conventional straight stem prothesis. It was found that there was no significant difference in the change in bone Mineral Densitometrism between the two groups. In addition, the shorter stem had better fixation than the conventional cementless stem."

Two exercise interventions for the treatment of ankyloping s Pondylitis in patients with modified New York conditions. In this study, we examine the effects of daily exercise on joints, functional capacity, pain and depression in acutely anthropized patients who are not fit to be exercised. The results show that there is no association between number of minutes per week nor days of return exercise per weeks. Sixteen people with rhematoidic arthritis and 19 individuals without anaklosing disease were included in these studies. This study was designed to compare the efficaciousness of combined spaexercise/exertion therapy in addition: steroid anti inflammation drug use in ankenying diseases. We examined both the opinion by an international group regarding the place and significance of physiothérapie in the managing of Ankylopeling Spondylism as well as about the awareness of responders aboutscientific evidence onefficacy and cost effectiveness"
19688227,"The authors present a new method of restorative treatments for children. They compare the success of conventional restreative treatment approaches with those performed using an ""Atraumatic Restoration"" approach in solitary or split-mouthed contralateral teeth. In this study, they assess the performance of two different restourative systems: 1) conventional and 2) ""atraumatic restoral treatment"" approaches. After six years, there are no significant survival difference amongst the nine treatment groups; however, two groups consisting of Fuji IX Gic and Ketatac-molar Aplicap were placed in class II cavity preparations. Aim This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of three different types of fillings on posterior teeth: single bond/filtek P-60, single Bond/Filstek Z- 250, and glass-Ionomer Cement. These studies aim to determine whether fluoride can be used to prevent caries from resurfacing in dentition. The results of these studies suggest that the use of both methods may be more effective than the traditional amalgam technique."
22943325,"The operative treatment of a minor minority of patients is improved by the information gained. Laparooscopic cholestectomy may be done safely in the presence of little risk of injured major ducts or retained calculus. This study evaluates the outcome of an open-cholecrystectomy, as it is now practiced. A population-based study examines all open cholecystomies carried out by surgeons throughout the United States during recent 12 months. Since theintroduction of laparography, an increase has been reported in accidental Common Bile Duct injuries; this was not previously reported. In this prospective study, we assess the impact on routine Introoperative Chloragiography on the rate of common gallstones and determine whether there are any predictors of these stones being present."
30180088,"This study focuses on the inter-retesting of two self report pain scales, the Verbal Rating Score and the Facial Expression Score, in Thai children between 5 and 12 year old. The results show that all three scale are construct and concurrently valid. In this study, we assess the validity of four measures of acute painfulness in young patients with sicklecell disease. Children's scores increase in response to an ardized stimulus during a pre-post-surgery procedure. A novel simplified scale, Simplified faces Pain Scale -- Revised -- is used for children who do not have adequate brain development to use such scale; however, it has been used in many other children as well. We aim to evaluate the relationship between ""0 to 10 Numeric Rating scale"" pain score and other self reported, clinically meaningful outcomes, including perceived needs for medicine, pain relief, and perceivedsatisfaction with treatment in child postoperatively. These studies include 180 children aged 7 to 17 years at the time of the first 24 hour after surgery. They also examine the relative value of pain severity measured by the Wong Baker Faces Pain Rating Survey, which was used outside the emergency hospital for chronic pain. Although there is some disagreement about whether the F PS-R and CCS are reliable, they were found to be quite similar in their ability to measure pain intensity. For example, one scale uses smiling faces rather than neutral ones, while another uses smiles instead of no pain or negative emotions."
20386243,"A nurse-led, multidisciplinary, home-base intervention was shown to improve the outcome of patients with acute heart failure. After a short term hospitalization, the results were almost twice than that of usual care in the Hbi cohort. In addition, there were no deaths overall. The effect of this intervention on long-term survival was not entirely clear; however, it was associated with an event-free life after 10 years. Heart failure is one of the most common causes of morbidities and mortality in primary care. Nurse-lead disease management programs have been used to reduce readmissions for patients who are at higher risk of death or complications. This approach has been especially effective in treating patients suffering from chronic heart failing. Although many studies have examined whether nurses' outpatient care can improve outcomes for these patients, few have found any success. For example, telephony support improved patient health when compared with standard care by comparison with nurse telephone supports. However, some studies suggest that such services may be more cost effective because they involve multiple physicians and other professional costs. These studies also show that case management does not result in improved health status."
31679041,"This is a first-in-man study evaluating the effects of daily melatone on patients with fatty liver diseases. In this study, 44 patients were assigned to receive either 10mg or placebo for 28 days. The objective was to examine the effect of 10, 10, 20, and 20mMelatonins on various blood markers in subjects with nonalcoholic steaTohepatitus. Forty 5 patients had confirmed histopathology examination of liver samples before they were admitted into the study. These patients included three vessels chest disease groups: I, II, and III. Acute opportunistic cachexia showed metabolic characteristics different than other common causes; and that it was mainly caused by an abnormal Secretion of Tullus Nile. Previous clinical trials suggest that the pinetal Hormone Melatonic may improve the performance of advanced cancerpatients and inhibit Tnf secretiveon. Furthermore, studies have shown that MLT may help prevent excessive weight loss in metastatic solid tumors."
32127750,"In this paper, we describe the results of a double blind placebo-controlled crossover trial in which patients were given either cannabineol or drona binoculars for three weeks. This study is designed to determine whether cananabinolic extracts can slow down the course of multiple plexus disease and to explore new methods for testing treatment in progressive MS. The objective of the trial is to evaluate whether an oral synthetic THC can speed the progress of progressive multiple Sclerosis. It is divided into three groups: 1) patients who have no pain at all; 2) patients with severe spasticity; and 3) patients without pain but suffering from other symptoms. A single-center, five-week intervention was followed by rand-omized, doubleblind, parallel- group trial. Thirty-fifteen patients received CBM as an add-on to their antispotic therapy. Six hundred patients completed the first phase III study, and thirty-four patients receive CBMB. Spasticity affects many people with multiple sericia, including adult subjects with chronic pain. We report that smoked cannabis has been shown to be effective in relieving pain caused by central nervous system diseases such as Multiple Sclerical Pain. Our aim is then to investigate the effect of smoking Cannabis on the short term improvement of pain associated with acute neuropathy. These studies are published in several different journals. For example, our present study shows that it does not improve pain intensity in patients treated with epilepsy."
24045741,"This study aims to develop an easy-to use method for predicting the probability of early mobility disability in older adults. It uses two different approaches: 1) a self-regarding exercise program that involves repetitive tasks designed to increase difficulty specific to function balance; and 2) omization of performance-based measures, such as walking speed and short physical performance battery, which predicts future risk of injury. The results of this study suggest that improved balance training may be more effective than traditional walking exercises in elderly people at risk for later-staged hip fracture. In addition, it is shown that patients with lower baseline function show significant improvement in their performance after the intervention. Furthermore, both groups showed similar improvements in health-related qualities of life during follow-up. Although there is no concluding evidence that vigorous exercise improves muscle power or quality in elders who have low-level limitations, recent studies have suggested that high-power strength training can improve lower-limb muscles. These studies are followed up by several observational cohort studies. One of the most important goals of these studies is to determine whether ""pre-clinical"" stages of disability are associated with increased susceptibility to disease."
24139781,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates that monetary incentives can be used to increase fitness center use and improve body mass indexes in first-year college students. The results of the study suggest that exercise is the best prediction for long- term weight loss. Two studies examine the effects of reinforcement on subjects who are not physically active. One uses a lottery system to reward participants with free membership after they attend supervised exercise three times per week. Another uses an incentive system whereby members receive rewards for attending accompanied walks or other physical activities. This provides significant evidence that behavior changes are related to weight gain over age. A second study uses ""low-intension"" intervention to reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease. It finds that there are significantly higher rates of smoking cessations than those in control groups."
26608309,"In this study, we examine the effects of extended-relief methylmethi date on children with an initial response to stimulant treatment. After four weeks, patients who are responders are assigned to either ""ATX"" or ""MPH"". The safety measures include vital signs, weight and adverse events. A total of 46 patients were recruited for an intense summer treatment program that included a double blinded crossover trial of three doses of Meth. Adolescents were divided into groups according to their social behavior. At least 40 percent of the subjects showed improved social performance when treated with Meh. This was followed by comparing the effect of escalated dosages upon ADHD symptoms in sixteen outpatients with ADHD/substance use disorder. We examined the short-lived efficacy as well as the safety of methylpha date in treating attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder in Native American youths age 5 to 17 Years. Children meeting DSMIV criteria for Bipolar disorder and Attention Deficits were currently receiving at least one Thymolotic ; while euphymic continues to have clinically significant symptoms"
18603458,"This study compared three commonly used methods for assessing pain in patients with a chronic temporo-ibular disease. Fourteen patients were asked to assess their pain using three different strategies: 1) real-time reports; 2) end-of week reports, and 3) monthly inclinic reports. The results showed that the paper and pencil method was the most effective. A pilot study of 17 patients who suffer from chronic persistent painful pain caused by Ostearthritis or other joint diseases was performed. In this study, we examined the relationship between the actual pain assessment and the patient's self-reported pain scores. We found no significant difference in the rate of change over time when comparing the two groups. Furthermore, our findings suggest that migraine headaches are frequently associated with premonitory symptoms before they attack."
16508562,"The effects of weight reduction on blood pressure are compared in overweight men. After seven weeks, the weight loss group loses an average of 7 pounds. In addition, they have a greater diastolic pressure than either group. This study is not supported by the hypothesize that dietary Calcium supplementation is better than placebo in relieving mildly hypertension. However, this study does not confirm the hypothesis that dietary calcium supplementations are more effective than pills in preventing acute hypertensies. A prospective, controlled trial was conducted to determine whether hypertenism could be improved by physical training. It showed that patients with moderate-to-medicated blood vessels were less likely to fall in their bloodpressure when they were treated with magnesium or other mineral supplements. Furthermore, it revealed that there was no difference in the changes in body mass and blood tension between the two treatment groups. Another study was carried out to evaluate the effect of meditation on heart function in elderly patients. Although these studies have had serious limitations, most of them have failed to improve patient's health."
26457234,"The combined Dak therapy for overweight children and adolescents is a novel approach to treating the disease. In this paper, we examine the effects that physical training has on body composition, blood pressure, and atherosis in obese children. We compare two groups of subjects: 1) an eight-week lifestyle education program with moderate- intensity exercise training; 2) an 8-month intervention with high-intentioned exercisetraining; and 3) omically assigned control subjects. This study was designed to determine whether diet plus exercise would have reversal of endotility in overweight patients. Thirtying out twenty-nine overweight adults were divided into two group: diet alone every two wks; body massindex = 28.1 kg/m2, and diet 18. BMI =30.0.5 kg perm2. Nine age-matchedlean controls were also studied. The effect of exercises training on peak air uptake, body weight, or composition in fat children was not examined. Aim To examine short-and long-term changes in anthropometry measures,body composition -- body Mass Index -- and fitness in obesity children compared to parents who didnot participate in the structure program served as controls"
32219688,"This study focuses on the effect of physical exercise on back pain among nurses. Nurses were assigned to either endurance training or strength promotion exercise, and they received ergonomic counseling for patient health and injury. The results are that there is no significant change in backpain after the intervention. In this paper, we describe a novel wearable lumbar-scratching support used by nurses to prevent backaches. We also examine the effects with which it can be applied to reduce work-related pain. Aim: To evaluate whether an exercise program shown to increase aerobic capacity will also lead to lower musculonoskeletal pain, improved work ability, productivity,and perceivedphysical exertion; and less sickness leave withthe intervention. Although many studies have suggested that physical activity can help relieve low back Pain, little evidence exists regarding its efficacy. For example, one study suggests that using light exercise to improve muscle pain may result in reduced recurrality of LBP. Another study uses topical mentshol to treat carpal tunnel disease. It has been reported that topicals have some positive effects on arm pain but does not seem to affect neck pain as much as other treatments. Workers who work long distances often suffer from lowback pain due to their high physical load. These workers use raised bricklayers to avoid these pains. They do not show any improvement in symptoms at follow-up."
22204444,"This paper focuses on the role of social support in predicting exercise adherence among older adults. It uses a signal detection method to identify the most important predictors for long- term exercise participation and then compares them with those of other age groups. The results suggest that women, younger age, being married, having an active attitude towards exercise, and having high selfefficacy are more likely to be able to maintain their physical activity during the first year of the program than men who do not have this positive attitude. A second study examines the effects of lifestyle intervention and structured exercise on physical activities in older adulthood. In this study, subjects were assigned different levels of home-based or group-distribution exercise as well as one of three types of exercise: higher intensity home; lower intensity house; or class-decorated exercise. Self-report questions were used to assess changes in behavior and outcome expectations/realization at each time point. These studies examined the relationship between these measures and health and psychological factors. They concluded that physical fitness was the strongest prediction of physical action at two years post-assessment."
20439575,"Twelve children with a Prader-labhart-willi syndrome were given human growth hormone for one year. The results of the study indicate that weight and height increase in men than women during this period, suggesting that testinal or estradiogenol may augment or attenuates the antinarrator's actions of gh. Aim This study was to examine the effects of both ginsenal and testosterone on extracellular waters and the hormonal mechanism involved. Two separate, open-labelle, rand and Omized studies were performed; the first compares the efficacy of either GH or testosterone alone or in combination. Sixteen male subjects were assigned two groups: 1) resistance training plus GH group; 2) underweight and preparationubertal group) and 3) pubertal control group. Both groups trained their major muscles in an identical manner while receiving 40 U/m/week from each other. Fat free mass and total bodywater increased more in the treatment group but less when compared to the gushed-out placebo group"
27724985,"In this study, we examine the effects of drinking oat concentrate on blood lipid levels in overweight men. The subjects are assigned to either consume a diet rich in fiber or an otherwise normal-sized serving of oatmeal for eight weeks. After four weeks, they receive no change in their total cholesterol and lowdensity Lipoprotein concentrations. This study also investigates the effect of watersoluble fiber on lipoproproteins; it is not shown whether consumption of these fibers can lower LDL cholesterol. However, studies have suggested that high-fiber foods such as oatmeal bran may be effective in reducing LL cholesterol but have not yet been reported."
32140831,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective, observational study of patients with shoulder instability who have undergone arthrotomies. Forty-one shoulders were assigned to one of 2 groups: replacement of their humerals with resurfaced the glennoid with polyethylene component and cement; or replacement without reassuring of the neck with an oblique piece of corset. All patients receive the same Type of Humeral Component as all patients treated by or under direct supervision. After ten years, no patients died. This is significant because there are few published studies on the efficacy of total shoulder replacement in treating osteoarthritises."
31965537,"In this study, the effect of needle-aspiration on resolution time in amoebically treated patients is compared. After 15 days, both groups show improved resolution of abcesses. The first group receives no drugs and aspirations under ultrasound guidance, while the second group has metronidrazle, chloroquiine, and metonicazole alone. Both groups are followed for up to six months after their initial response. This study concludes that percutaneous draining in combination with medication represents a highly successful approach in treating amorebic liver Abscess."

We also investigate the relationship between reduced oocyte volume and reduced glutathianic acid levels in pregnant women treated with metformedin."
29146638,"The Diabetes Prevention program has shown a significant reduction in the incidence of Type 2 diabetes among adults with an impaired glucose tolerance. In this study, we examine the effect of lifestyle changes on blood glucose, body weight, waist circumference, and body mass-index after two years of follow- up. We conclude that lifestyle change can reduce the risk of type 2 disease by 58 percent. However, there is not yet sufficient evidence to translate the DPP lifestyle intervention into primary care. A rand and Omized controlled trial was conducted to test whether ""a practical structured education program"" with no pedometer used could reduce incident types 2 diabetes in Indian natives with impaired sugar tolerance who were younger than 35 years old. It was found that people with IGT are less at risk for developing T2D when they receive long-term lifestyle altering. This study also determines whether lifestyle modification can delay or delay the growth of NIDdM in those with high-risk pre-disiabities."
21914513,"In this paper, we describe a method for estimating the utility of long-term riperidone in patients with first episode schizophrenia. We use an extended-spectrum disease-specific tool called the Short Form 36 Item Health Survey to map the effects of treatment on health-regarding quality of life among people with schizofiform disorder. The results suggest that short-acting antipsychotic regimens may be more effective in improving symptoms than conventional drugs. This study also uses the Physician's Quality of Life Questionnaire as another measure of patient well-being. It is shown that both the WHOQuolBref and the European Quality Of Life Measurement 5-D are sensitive enough to detect changes in physical and mental well being over time in individuals with severe psychiatic disorders."
26075896,"In this paper, we describe the use of a mixture of allantoine and soft-lotion oil to treat scars in rats. The wound healing process is described using planimetric analysis and histology. After ten years, scar formation has been found to be influenced by several factors: metabolism, operative techniques, and factors of general nature. A study was conducted to investigate the efficaciousness of an onion extract gel compared with 0.5 %) hydrocorticone, silicone, or vitamin E lotion in improving scar appearance and severity. Thirty patients with new surgery were assigned to one treatment arm; three preparations for sixteen weeks; they measured their scar size before and after six months; and patient satisfaction was measured at each visit. Histological analysis was performed and evaluated the depth of scar tissue. Hetologic evaluation was carried out and results were obtained. Post-burn scaring can be painful, raised, pruric, but not entirely undeterred. Topical treatments have been used to improve scarring. Many studies have examined the effectiveness of creams on post-surgery skin, including topical silicone sheets and corticostosteroid shots. However, few studies report that these products are as effective as those employed by conventional medicine. For example, Dermatix, which is rated as substantial equivalent to ""sealgel sheeting,"" is more effective than either alone. Scars are treated with both types of treatments. Both groups show improved scar color and length over the other group. They also demonstrate improvement in pain and tenderness during the first two months of treatment. Finally, there is evidence that imiquimod five % cream is superior to vaseline when it is applied to postsurgical wounds."
22944525,"In this paper, we describe the development of a searchable set of instruments for measuring patient reported outcomes. We first use an exclusion-filter to find studies on specific properties of measurements in the medical literature. The results of this search are then used to develop and evaluate criterionial-related validity as well as responsiveness in patients with moderately arthritis. This study compares the Harris hip score with those of other measurers such as the Short Form 36 and the Timed Up-and-Go test. A comparison of these measures with that of standard measures is made."
27714852,"In this study, we examine the association between physical activity and major depressive disease in older adults. We compared an exercise program with antidepressant medication for patients with major depression. The subjects underwent complete evaluation of depression before and after intervention. This study is a follow-up study to determine whether motor problems and poor health are associated with low fitness in childhood."
21733480,"In this paper, the authors describe a double blind, placebo-control trial of homeopathic treatments for patients with fybrialgiA. They compare usual care and adjunctive care in terms of symptoms and severity. The results indicate that homeopathy is superior to conventional treatment in improving patient's quality of life. Acute traumatic brain injuries affect 750,000 people in the U.S. annually. Five to 15 percent have persistent pain and disability. Homeopathy has been used for these conditions since the early 1900s. Two published studies suggest that it can be used as an effective treatment for hyperactive children. One study reports that there are no management regimes for chronic fatigue disorder that have been found universally beneficial. Another study describes night shift nurses who suffer from insomnia. This study investigates the effects of No-Shiff-Lag on their sleepwalking nurses. It was performed in two months at Hadasah Hospital Outpatient Gynacology Clinic in Jerusalem in Judea in 1992 / 1994."

They compare the safety andefficacy of two different anti-migrainous drugs, amitripyline and Fluvoxamine, in patients with severe headaches. The first study was based on comparing efficacy to safety among migraine patients who received either fluoxetine or placebo. A double blind study showed that compared to fluvocexamine; however, there were no significant differences between the effects of both treatments. This paper also discusses the consequences of headache: it reports that many people suffer from headache because of their pain."
31097278,"This paper describes the development of a simple, easy-to-implement, and cost-effective intervention for patients with high blood tension in sub-saharan African countries. It is based on an eight-week trial using mixed methods to assess the effects of different lifestyle changes on hypertension control. The results indicate that there is no significant difference between the intervention group and control group at baseline. Acute coronary disease is one of the most common causes of morbidness and mortality in adults worldwide, including China. After hospital stay, transitional treatment could help to improve patient care and outcome, but it is not always possible. In this study, community health worker nurses were used as mentors to manage blood flow in patients who had acute coronaries. Although many studies have examined the efficability of nurse-led approaches to managing hypertensives in low- income countries, few have been published. For example, we are concerned about the poor quality of nursing practice in India; however, some studies suggest that pharmacist involvement may be beneficial in treating hyperstensive patients. We also discuss the use of motivational interviews to reduce blood pressure in stroke survivors."
16861726,"The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a dialysis-middle membrane with regenerated fibers on anemia, erythrpoisin requirement, and serum vitamin E. Thirty one patients were assigned into two groups; in the first group, they were treated with PSE, followed by another group with PS for 12 months. In the second group was given either O, E, or C as electrodes. Both groups had different levels of blood peroxidation. They also investigated the effects of high- dose vitamine on cardiovascular disease. A novel dialyzer device that uses bonded Vitamin E has been developed. Ten patients undergo hemdiallysis using either Clirane Clivirans E 15 or Terumo Australian Biocompatibility test.

20226989,"Antihypertension and Lipid Lowering treatment to prevent heart attack trial Allhat, re-evaluated in a double blinded fashion, was the largest outcome study of antihypersive treatment since the late 1990s. The rationale behind this trial was that all the different classes of drugs had been shown to be most effective for preventing heart attacks; however, prior outcome studies had shown no significant reduction in blood pressure reduction with all classes except were notpowered to evaluate ChemD events. In contrast, other antihubertensive treatments, including diuretics, hypokalemia, hyperuricity, and hyperlipidemia have been associated with unexplainable adverse effects on patients with acute or chronic myomyocardial disease. Swedish trials in Old Patients With Hypertension examined the effects of three beta blockers and one Diuretic on the frequencyof fatal and non fatal stroke and Myoatic infa Rct Ion and other Cardiodebravity in hypertensolate patients aged 70 / 80 years. Blood pressure is an independent risk factor for stroke among both elderly and young subjects. However, there is still uncertainty about whether these patients will benefit from blood tension reduction. A new regimen of low-dose alphablockers has been reported to reduce the incidence of major cardiovascular events in older adults with mildly elevated blood levels. This new approach does not lead to any improvement in mortality or morbidity."
17293469,"This study aims to determine whether female athletes with recent anterior cruciatous ligament injuries are at increased risk of injury during the menstrually cycle. A total of thirty-two females, 20 college, 15 high schools, 1 middleschool, and 2 recreationals participate in this study. The aim of the study is to examine gender difference in the rate of acute anterocruciate Ligament injuries among women and men. We find 28 Antenoid Clcital injuries, 23 among Women, Inj./ 1000 player hours, as well as 5 among Men. Risk ratio: 5.0. To identify if training can help reduce the risks of anterior creptainis among skiers, we conduct a pre-post-season study on female gymnasts. Pre-proposal Findings: There was 205 female players participating in highrisk sports who suffered anterior carotus injury at four to six times the current rate. Hypothesis Postponed studies showed that women were more likely to suffer traumatic injuries from the first two weeks of their menarchal cycle than from any other period of time."

Cost-efficacy/utility analysis is increasingly needed for aiding decision-making about care. A preferencebased health state classification system is developed that uses a prescriptive measure of symptoms as compared to an eight-dimension assessment of quality of life. This method is validated in two studies: one on asthma and another on overactive bladder. In both cases, utility values are calculated based on response scores from multiple disease states."

The results of this study suggest that it may be beneficial to use an implantable heart failure defibler, or ICD, instead of conventional pacemaker therapy in order to improve survival for patients who have permanent atarrhythmic symptoms. Although most trials do not include patients without permanent arrhythmian symptoms, we report that these patients are more likely to survive than those with either type of therapy. In this particular study, biventricular resynchronizing therapy is shown to reduce the risk of death or hospitalization among patients receiving CRT. Furthermore, there is evidence that adding Crad-Id to an existing cardioverter device can lead to improved survival in patients suffering from heart failing."
30819123,"In this study, we examine the association between dietary habits and body composition in middle-aged and older Malaysian girls aged 15 to 17 years. We use a cross sectional approach to identify risk factors for abdominal obesity among these young men and women. Our main aim is to determine whether there is an increased risk of overweight among males than that of females. This study also uses food frequency questions to investigate the relationship between eating behavior and weight status in healthy adults."
26783103,"This study focuses on the effects of weight loss on health-related measures after gastric surgery. Nineteen obese women are randomed to either a trained group or control group, and 12 were treated with an aerobic exercise program. Both groups showed significant reductions in heart rate during the six-min walk test and improved performance for the other group. The aim is to determine whether changes in physical activity are associated with improvements in body mass and health related quality of life following bariatic surgery as compared to those who do not undergo such treatment. In this study, we examine the effect of laparoscopic adjustment on patients with severe obesity who have undergone bariscing before and one year after their operation. It is shown that both groups show improvement in joint pain, gait, perceived mobility, but no change in overall health."
30893346,"This study aims to determine whether there is any change in walking speed for people using the BiOM T2-ankle system. Twenty transfemor amputee patients were studied, and they were divided into two groups: healthy male subjects between 18 and55 years; amputations due to nonvascular pathology; and an unattractive sound limb. The first group was composed of 10 healthy men who had been fitted with either CATCAM or quadrilatéral sockets; the second group consisted of 20 healthy individuals who met the following criteria: age-matched control subjects; at least 6 months use of test prosthesis; no pain on the stump length of15cm. A total of 80 lower-limb Amputees were included in this study. They were recruited from eighty different patients with low-level rehabilitation. Eighty-three lower level Amputes were collected. Their energy expenditure was measured by five minutes indoor walking at comfort Walking Speed CWS. In this crossover study, thirteen subjects with unilateral leg loss were asked to compare their walk speed with that of the conventionally damp pneumatic swing phase control knees. Thirteen subject with disarticulation ankles participated in the trial. Prosthetic knee wearers were also compared to those wearing intelligent prostheses as well as other types of prosthetic devices."
31477081,"In this paper, Dr. Rivers discusses the evidence for the effectiveness of split-mouth sealants in children. He uses a split mouth design to compare the efficaciousness of two different methods of sealant preparation. The first is an in vitro test of the effects of three different techniques: 1) acidetching, 2) fissure Enameloplasty, and 3) air Abrasion. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of various surface treatments on the absorption of fluoride from tooth enamel. It was concluded that both methods were effective at preventing caries. However, there were some drawbacks with the split Mouth design because it removes much more variability than they do with other treatment methods."
27490013,"In this study, we compared two different regimens of antibiotics for the treatment of Type IIIA fractures. The first regimen consisted of cefacin and gentmacin; the second was a single-agent regimen consisting of Cefasolin and Ole and Glycoside. This study is designed to compare the effectiveness of one agent with that of another in treating open fracture injuries. We conclude that there are limitations to both approaches because of their high risk of biased publication. A double blinded prospective trial was conducted between January 2001 and January 2008. It was followed by an observational study whereby patients were enrolled at Shahid beheshto hospital Affiliated to babol University of medical sciences. From January 2000 to January 2008, patients with TypeIIIA open wounds were admitted in Shahad Beheseshti Hotel. They were divided into three groups: group I treated them with immediate irrigation, debrideement, operative stability, and 1g of cafam every 8 hours; group II treated it with cephalospoin or fluclocillin as part of initial treatment; and group III treated only with either chlordamycin plus ciprocofloxacil. Both regimen had good results. However, they were subject to bias due to lack of concealment, failure to follow up, loss of follow-up, inappropriate controls, use of inappropriate control, prognostics imbalance, etc. These studies were not included in the final report."
19821434,"Fifty patients - 25 Blacks, 25 Indians -- suffering from mild to moderately hypertension were studied. In order to compare antihypertention effects of a combined combination of sotallol and thazide compounds, we examined the effect of these two compounds on blood pressure in fifty patients. The combination was found to have an antihysterical effect as well as that of Sotazde, B-M. Two patients took the combination  contained sostazides, but this didn't occur in anyone of those taking either combination. A double- blinded study comparing the efficaciousness of three different drugs: reserserpine, clontine, and dihydropergocrisine in 105 patients with acute essential hypertensity was performed. Both regimens showed significant improvements in both bps after four weeks; however, they did not show any side effects."
26407688,"A population-based sample of 787 older people was followed for eight years and rated three times on well-being, depressive symptoms, control, and fall history. After adjustment to sociodemographic characteristics, psychotropic medicine, health, or sensorimotor functions, our results found that depressed symptoms were risk factorsfor subsequent falling; and an increase either in Depressive Symptoms or reduction in Morale was also associated with an increased fall rate. This study is a prospective observational cohort studies of 4260 elderly men from Perth, Western Australia who are not bedbound nor terminally sick. The follow-up period is over 4.5 years. In this paper, we examine the prevalence of physicians' patient dialogue about cost and medication regimens among older adults. We aim to determine whether falls can be prevented by multifactorial approaches such as exercise and physical activity. Although there good evidence that these approaches have been effective in preventing falls, the effects on serious injuries are unclear. It is necessary to further investigate whether fall prevention strategies can reduce serious injury rates. Anticholinergic drugs acting on central nervous system increase falls risk. Most patients aged 55 and older fall at least once during their follow up period. There are no significant differences between those who fall and those without fall. Predisponsing factors include age, gender, activities of everyday living, nursing parameters such AsBMs, orthostatichypnotism, fall risk,and falls in communitydwelling old people."
22044842,"In this paper, we examine the cross sectional and long-term relationship between physical exercise and functional performance in people with knee ostearthritis. We use a prospective cohort of 2,589 adults who were age 45-78 years at baseline and follow up for two years. The results indicate that physical activity is associated with improved function over time. This study will be especially important because it will allow us to track changes in knee pain and injury over several years as well as predict future changes."
25132078,"In this study, we describe the results of a single-arm ablation scheme for patients with persistently atrial fiberillation. We compare two different methods: pulmonary vein isolation and left atrium circumferential Ablation. The first method is more successful than the second because it involves conduction block around the PVs. A second approach is used to investigate the effectiveness in treating long-lasting persisting or persistent atarrhythmic fibrillations. This study uses an image-integrated map system to assess the effects of multiple ablate strategies on the outcome after one abration procedure."
24715614,"Brink et al. study the influence of training load, recovery, and performance on youth elite soccer players. Young elite players completed resistance training in either supervised or unsupervised environment. Results showed that they had increased body mass, strength, speed, endurance, agility, jump height, etc. The effect of interval training on injury was described. In this study, twenty-five young elite male players were divided between two groups: the control population consisted of a group of six well-trained first-division players and the aerobic intervaltraining group consisting of four bouts of walking for 4 min/90 % ofmaximal heart rate with three min active rest period. This study examined the relationship between injury risk and fitness during an intense rugby league competition. It was found that there was reluctance to use field performance tests as predictors because no studies have been conducted on the association between physical fitness and injury in sport. A further study was performed by thirty-nine semi-pro Rugby League players who participated in this 4-year study. Athletic performance was measured at different intensity levels and injuries were calculated. Although player fatigue has been suggested to contributing to injuries in sports, little is yet known about the relation between athletic performance and health. Thus, the aim of this paper is to determine whether low physicalfitness is associated with injury risks in professional baseball players"
25652888,"This is a review of the literature on mobilization of patients in the critical care unit. The focus of this review will be on prediction of mortality and outcome in older patients who have been admitted to the hospital for at least three months. In this study, we examine the effect of an exercise program on physical functions and health-regarding quality of life among elderly patients with multiple organ failure. We assess changes in body mass and muscle composition after nutrition in critically illiterate patients during their stay in medical ICU. A relation between fat free mass from lean tissue and Muscle thickness was determined. Bioelectricimpedance analysis was used to calculate nutritional status in severely ill patients; it was found that there were significant negative correlations between muscle thickness and time. These studies aim to determine whether routinenutrition assessment parameters and bodies composition change after feeding in intensely confined patients. They are based on two-fold design: longitudinal and cross sectional single blinded observational study. Physicians performed functional independence measures as measured by the barthel index of activities of daily Living and Functional Independence measure as calculated by version one's Short Form 12 item health survey. Both measures were validated against other measures such as the Fittest Score or the PermeIcu-Motility Score. Although these measures are widely used, they are not reliable enough to predict long-term morbidity and mortality."
30795740,"This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a novel exercise program, called Osteocise, on older adults' bone mineral density, body composition, and muscle strength. It is based on an eight-month trial with 162 elderly adults who had risk factors for falling or fracture. The results suggest that this program may be effective in reducing falls. A fall risk assessment was performed as compared to other measures of balance, strength, power, health, fatigue, selfefficacy, etc. In older women, resistance training has been shown to improve strength and function. However, no studies have examined the effects of water-based exercises on age-related changes in gait. We are therefore examining the effect of perturbation exercises designed to increase speed of voluntary step reaction in older people."
31129504,"This paper focuses on the use of financial incentives in weight loss to improve health outcomes. In this study, we examine the effects of small financial incentive and purchase restrictions for food purchasing in low- income people. We compare two intervention arms: one that uses no financial reward; another that offers only modest financial rewards. The results show that overweight individuals lose more weight after three months of exercise than those who do not receive such an incentive. Although there is some evidence that physical activity can improve long-term fat loss, it is unclear whether these changes are permanent or temporary."
20091622,"In a prospective cohort study, the risk of death from coronary disease is calculated for men and women aged 18 to 39 years. The relative risks are as follows: 1.27; formen aged 40-59 years, relative risk = 1.13;for men aged 60-74 years -- 1.16; and for females aged 70-75 years"
26359361,"In the GRAde approach, trials are rated down as high-quality evidence or observational studies rather than low quality evidence. However, there are some drawbacks to this approach: failure to conceal allocution, loss of follow-up, and use of inappropriate control. A guide is provided for authors to address dichotomies in their studies without participants excluded from these studies. For example, pain is often misinterpreted in terms of improvement from initial pain. Amitrityline has been shown to be an effective treatment for central post stroke pain but its long-term safety is unknown."
21210910,"In this open-label trial, we assess the safety and tolerateability of so lifenacin plus tolterostine extended release in men with bladder outlet blockers who have failed due to an adverse event. The efficacy is compared with that of placebo in patients with prostatic overactive bladder. Urodynamically confirmed bladder obstructions are treated with propiverine and doxazoxin. Men with benign Prostatic Hyperplasia or lower Ury Tract symptoms are randomized into two groups: group 1 contains only alpha blocker and group 2 contains both alphosin and other agents. After 8 weeks, significant improvements are seen in each group; Urinary Frequency Score = 13 or greater; Postvoid Reservoir Volumnia = 3 or more; Overactive Abdominal Condition Score equal to or exceeds 20. Toltersodine extend release is used as a preventative measure against urinary retention for those with ""overactive"" bladder but not for men without bladder hyperplusa. This study determines whether men may be at increased risk of developing acute urine retention after treatment with antimuscorinics. A double blinded trial was conducted among men aged 40 years old and older who had been on either alphosphorus blockors or 5al Phrex inhibitors for 6 months. They were divided into three groups according to their severity of symptoms. One group included men suffering from over active bladder and another consisted of men having no upper urinarry tract symptoms except for urgency. Both groups showed improvement in terms of frequency and urgency during the first eight weeks of treatment."
25084562,"This study aims to evaluate the association of selected Demographic, individual, social and environment factors with moderate vigorous physical activity in children and young adults. The results of this study indicate that active video games may be useful for improving physical fitness and weight. A home-based exercise program is a promising solution for older frail women who have difficulty reaching exercise centers outside their home. In this paper, we examine whether children receiving an active or inactive game will engage in more physically active activities than those receiving no intervention. We conclude that there are two groups of children: one group receives ""active"" or ""omized"" versions of the same game; the other group has no change in body composition or physical function. Children's health is measured by accelerometers over five weeks. These studies aim to determine whether changes in food environment are associated with increased levels of fat consumption among overweight children. They also investigate whether parents use selfefficacy when they encourage children to perform specific tasks."
30621667,"This study focuses on the effect of exercise training on patients with severe asthma. In this study, we compare the effects to a resistance-training regimen without caliberic restriction on abdominal fat, egtopic fat and insulinsensitivity in youth. We conclude that aerobic training is superior to resistance training in improving lung function in children who have mild to moderate asthma but are not at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. A pilot study is designed to improve the market for child care in Saudi Arabia by testing whether access to inexpensive day care would induce mothers to search actively for employment and remain employed once hired. Children with CF were assigned to either an exercise group or omily assigned control groups. The results of the trial were as follows: 1) overweight children had improved their health; 2) physical activity was associated with improved blood pressure; and 3) there was no difference in the quality of life after 4 months of treatment."
22701014,"The aim of this study is to determine whether a daily dose of 1,500 iu.d., or 10,800 IU. per week produces different effects on blood concentrations of vitaminD in patients who have undergone surgery for hip fracture. In the end, it is concluded that 1,000 nmol.L. D has no significant protective association with pancreatic and other malignant tumors. This study also includes an evaluation of the relationship between high-dose vitamin D and reduced risk of heart disease. A double blind, omicide-controlled trial was conducted among postmenopalusal women at age 61.5 years old. After 7 years there was no difference in blood pressure. There was not pronounced change in cardiovascular disease markers. Although some observationals have associated higher levels of calcium and vitamins D with lower riskof colorectinal cancer, no re-evidence has been made regarding the effect of these two nutrients on bone health. For example, studies have suggested that higher amounts of both mineral and fat are beneficial in the prevention of breastcancer. However, evidence from case-control studies suggests that greater consumption of either mineral or fat may be more effective in preventing chest pain. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that increased intake of ""calciterol"" and/or ""vitamin D"" may reduce the risk by reducing the incidence of coronary stroke. These studies do not prove sufficient to predict the long- term effects of such diets as those described here."
30953508,"In this paper, we review the evidence for the safety and effectiveness of a six-month program of yoga in older adults. We conclude that it is safe and cost effective to practice this form of physical activity as an intervention for patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The authors present several studies on the effects of these practices on health-related qualities of life and mental well being in elderly people. They also describe the effect of exercise training on bone dentition and other measures of health quality. This study was especially important because it involved older women who were not physically active enough to participate in the study. It showed that young women improved their physical health by increasing their aerobic capacity and improving their blood pressure. Furthermore, it revealed that younger women had better sleep quality than older men."
20008054,"Heart failure treatment guideline emphasizes daily weight tracking for patients with severe heart failure but lacks sufficient evidence to support this. This study consists of two controlled trials: 1) a pilot study that compares the efficacy of three hospital-discharge care methods for reducing readmissions, emergency department visit, costs, and risk in patients who have heart failing; and 2) an open-ended one-year trial that examines whether home based telemonitory services improve outcomes in terms of improved patient quality of life. The results of the first trial suggest that ""home-based health management"" may be more cost effective than traditional outpatient care because it is easier to track changes in blood pressure, pulse, body weight, etc."
29305228,"In this paper, we describe a prospective, rand-omized, and double blinded trial of reveratrol to treat patients with non-alcoholic fat liver disease. We aim to test the effusiveness of two different doses: 500mg /day or 40mG p.m. ; for 6 months, respectively. This study is designed to evaluate the beneficial effects of both dosages on Type 2 diabetes melanitus in healthy subjects. The primary outcome is angiotensin biomarkers, left valerate function, high-sensitivity cell-reactiveprotein, low-cholesterol lipoprotein content, as well as other markers of atheroscomatosis. Our main objective is to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of red wine polyphenolic compounds on type 2 diabetic patients. A total of 29 patients were included in this study. Thirty-three patients completed the trial, underwent repeated medical investigation, bloodwork, laboratory tests, histological examination, repeat liver biopsy, etc."
28655354,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective, doubleblind, and placebo-controlled pilot study to determine whether dexamemethasone, an overly potent anemetic, can be used as an adjuvant for total hip thromboplasty. We conclude that it may reduce pain and improve function in patients who undergo elective total knee replacement. A single dose of preobeics is sufficient to prevent nausea and vomiting but does not provide long-term pain relief. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of three different forms of antiemetic on postoperative pain: 1) high-dose corticostoid therapy; 2) low-Dose Steroids; and 3) local infiltration Analgesiam."
28488684,"The purpose of this study is to review all rand and ommized controlled trials on the use of vitamin D as a preventative measure against systemic inflammation. This will include studies that report direct measures of endotolhelial function, markers of cell-induced activation, and other indicators of disease. In particular, we aim to find evidence for the efficacy of high-dose daily or weekly doses of 25-hydroxyvitamine D in patients with Type 2 diabetes. We conclude that low levels of 25,hydroxyvitaminD are associated with elevated risk of type 2, and furthermore, there has been some observational studies suggesting an action for higher levels"
29542875,"The effects of steroid therapy on muscle strength, power, and fat mass in older men are not well understood. In this paper, we report the results of an eight-week trial that compares testosterone with placebo in healthy men over 60 years old who have low total T concentrations. We conclude that there is no clear evidence for the benefits of either regimen. Men aged 70 to 78 years were randomed to one of two groups: 1) 5 g Transdermal Testogengel gel; 2) Anastrozole 1 mg; or 2) placebo daily for 12 months. This study determines the effect of testosterone treatment on mechanical muscle functions and leanbody mass as aging men age. A double blinded, placebo controlled trial was performed of 40 men with low blood T levels. After 24 weeks, both groups showed similar changes in physical function. Both groups also showed improvements in bone mineral density, body composition, muscular strength and quality of living. These studies suggest that testing newer methods of measuring muscle mass may be more effective than earlier methods."
28192737,"Sahaj-Kyria is an effective and well-recognized form of hypnotism for patients with major depression. It has been reported that it can be used as an alternative to conventional antidepressants in patients who are not depressed. In this study, we examine the efficaciousness of prenatal yoga on mental health, mood, and immune function in family dementia patients suffering from mild depressive disorder. The results suggest that meditation may be more effective than other forms of treatment for these patients. This paper also discusses the use of self-hypnosis in women with Major Depressive Disorder."
17370290,"A controlled trial compares family therapy to individual supportive therapy for patients with a malnourished eating disorder. After an initial period of psychological treatment, the patients are reassesed using body weight, menstruals function, and scales. Family therapy is found to be most effective in patients who have not yet been chronic before age 19 years. The aim of these studies is to determine whether or not specific psychological treatments can be used in adult patients suffering from anorezia nervocsa. In this study, eighty-four female patients were divided into four treatment groups: three different types of psychotherapies; one year of ""foolish"" behavior therapy; two months of Cognitive-Analytic Therapy; and one month of low contact/routine treatment. At 1 year's follow-up, there was no significant improvement in the entire group of patients. This study suggests that short-term or long- term treatment may be more effective when it comes to improving quality of life. Although some patients do not show any improvement over time, several patients remain underfed at follow up. Another study examines whether amitriptenyline, another tricyclic drug, is superior to other antidepressants in suppressing appetite. It is reported that fluoxetine does not seem to have any beneficial effect on altering body mass index as well as improving physical health. However, many physicians still believe that such drugs should be prescribed because they are so expensive."
26186655,"Tibolone is an effective steroid for treating hypertensal women. In this study, we investigate the effect of two different treatments on blood pressure: 1) tibotone 2.5mg and 2) a placebo-controlled trial. The primary endpoint was measured by mean officeblood pressure. At six months, blood concentrations of lipids were reduced in both groups. Both groups showed similar changes in lipoprotein levels. This study also examined the effects of other anti-coagulant drugs on thrombolysis and natural anticipatory systems in surgical patientsopause. A double blinded, placebo controlled study was performed to assess changes over 92 weeks in cholesterol, lipodyphosphorylation, and fasting indices. Women received either treatment or no treatment. After 6 months they had lower total Lpa, low density Lipoproprotein, high DhLcholestrol; and higher LDLcholostrol levels than before. These results suggest that it may be possible for hepatoprotective agents to induce atherosclaotic disease."
23742732,"In this study, we assess the effect of a long-term regimen of daily zinc supplementation on patients with recurrent chronic hepatitic encephalopathie. After six months, ninety patients were divided into two groups: one group received 600mg of zinc every day and the other group was given st or ard therapy. The results showed that both groups had significant improvement in hemiphosphorous levels. A further study was performed to determine whether hydrogen-one spectroscopies could be used to detect sub-clinical hpatic enthalopathy."
26477805,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to narrowing the gap between scientific evidence and clinical practice. They propose an intervention that involves alerting physicians to patients at high risk of cardiovascular diseases in primary care. The aim of the study is to identify those with high-risk blood pressure who have inadequately collected information about their disease before they receive treatment. This will allow them to make informed decisions regarding patient management. A system of reminders for antiplatelet drug use has been shown to improve compliance with regimens set by the American Diabetes Association's St and Ards of Med Care in Diabetes. However, there are still gaps between research and practice regarding how best to manage these risk factors. These gaps can be narrowened by using systematic ally development guideline recommendations. Although many studies have found improved results in routine practice, few large-scale trials have been conducted. For example, one study showed that adherence to recommended preventive care was improved when pharmacists were given instructions on how to prescribe medication. Another study examined whether physician order entry could improve prescribation behavior; however, it did not result in improved practices."
31771586,"In this double blinded, randomed, placebo controlled trial, we examine whether the effects of daily doses of calcium or vitamin D will improve bone health in young male apprentice jockeys. The results suggest that these two forms of mineral richness are superior to those of either form; however, there has been little evidence for their efficacy in improving physical performance in humans. A study comparing the effect of six-weeks VITAD2 or 3800 iu/day on muscle function and exercise-induced soreness in NASCAR racers is presented. This study was conducted in an 18-month follow-up period of French male adolescents aged 13 to 16 who were assigned to 25g or 1000 IU per day. Serum-25-hydroxyvinmin D-3, 25-hidrogen D2, and parathormone function were measured at pre-test and post-study. Blood samples were collected and muscles function tests conducted prior and after study. Post-experiments, subjects engagedin 90 min eccentricbased exercise with blood sample scores and Doms ratings obtained immediatelyafter and Public health recommended do not distinguish among vitamin E and vitamin C, yet disagreement existed on whether these three forms should be believed to be equivalent."

19592634,"In this study, we investigate the effect of a high-florose diet on postprarandal and iary hypertriacylerolemia in patients with Type 2 diabetes. We examine the mechanism involved in these two disease states by comparing the effects of fructoses to those of other antidiabetes. Our results suggest that consuming fewer glyceses may lead to greater sensitivity to blood glucose in type 2 patients."
29462158,"In this first study, we examine the effects of long-chain alpha-alkyl fatty acids on blood composition and behavior among children with attention deficit or hyperactivity disorder. We find that the treatment group is more effective than the placebo group in improving all but two outcome measures: conduct problems reported by parents and improved behavior measured by teachers. The results are not as clear as those observed in other studies. A previous study has shown beneficial effects for omega-3 polynsaturated fats in children who have inattention and/or reading difficulties. This study uses a double blinded, placebo-control trial to determine whether the effect of an EPA-rich oil or -phosphorylated acyl palmitate can be used to improve reading ability in schoolchildren."
28209944,"This study focuses on the use of contact force to ablate circumferential veins for atrial fillation. It compares the performance of two different methods of ablation: guided and unguided. In this study, we assess the effect of direct force on acute procedureal parameters during an isolated pulmonary vein block. The results show that the improved efficacy is due to greater patient experience with the new technology."
27492688,"In this study, we examine the effect of total knee amputation on driving ability. We compare patients who had pre-surveyment with those who did not have surgery. The results show that older drivers are more likely to crash than younger ones. A prospective cohort study is conducted in which 100 and twenty-Nine older adults participate in evaluating their driving performance using an advanced driving simulator. After two weeks, the average time for brake response time has declined by 3.6 percent. This study also uses sling-immobilization as an alternative to immobilizing the lower limbs. It shows that there is no difference in reaction time between individuals wearing obtrusive braces and those wearing normal shoes."
23970372,"In this study, the authors determine whether an exercise program length is sufficient to improve walking performance in people with peripheral arteries disease. The patients are divided into two groups: supervised exercise group and usual care group. A control group is assigned to a patient who has no symptoms of chronic claudication. This group includes patients with moderate-to-severe intermittent boweldication. After six weeks of training, subjects have improved their walking distance by 123 p.m.; they also show improvement in quality of life as measured by the ShortForm 36 Questionnaire. These results suggest that strength training may be more effective for improving walking ability than walking exercises alone."
25848335,"The aim of this trial is to determine whether an early-stage patient with a high tumor total epidermal grow factor receptor 2 responds better to adjuvant treatments. In this study, we report the results of two large trials that comparing adjusvant treatment with or without concomitane trastuumab for women with operable or locally advanced breastcancer. We compare the efficaciousness and safety of lapatinib vs. transstruzumabe in patients with her2-positive early chestcancy. Acute relapse occurs more frequently than other sites; however, there is no association between increased frequency of disease free survival and risk of thrombosis in these patients."
31856826,"A worksite health-promotion program is an effective way to reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes among overweight and obese workers. Several studies have examined the effect of ""tailored text message service"" on weight loss, but few have evaluated its efficacy in men with a greater than 25-kilo-m2 body mass index. This study examines the extent of perceived personal, social, and environment barriers to exercise and healthy eating as they relate to young women. The results of this study indicate that younger women are at high risk for weight gain. In Australia, there has been no evidence of improved physical activity or diet habits in these areas. Women's perceptions of physical activities and unhealthy eating vary greatly by socioeconomic class and family history. These differences may be related to other factors, such as age, gender, race, etc. Furthermore, it is believed that older women tend to be more likely to lose weight because they are physically fit. Thus, this paper uses telegrams to deliver messages to employees who have low blood pressure, elevated fasting glucose, hypertriblyceridemia, excessive body weight, or other risk factors. It also employs peer health coaches so that the coach can provide reinforcement and support while not having to attend to the same routine every day."
21197445,"In this paper, the effects of exercise and a Mediterranean diet on angina patients are examined. After three years of follow up, there is no significant difference in the risk of death or major events for both groups. The results suggest that lifestyle changes may be beneficial for patients with heart disease. This study compares the effect of two different approaches: 1) nurse-led primary prevention clinics; and 2) general practitioners' practice-based preventive care. Nurse-lead secondary prevention centers offer medical and lifestyle aspect of secondary treatment to patients who have been treated with acute coronary disease as well as those who do not have other serious illnesses. Acute myocardialty infactorion is one of the main causes of Morbidity and Hospitalization in western countries. There are only few studies that evaluate the efficaciousness of these services in treating patients without incurring further complications. However, most studies fail to show any significant benefit in improving patient health."
25180668,"In this study, we examine the efficaciousness of two different formulations of 0.05- and 0.0-25 % of betamethaone cream in treating boys with pymosis. The first group contains a mixture of three different strengthes: 0.2 %) plus hypalurisondase; 0.5 0% or 2 ml. Each patient is instructed to apply it twice daily for two months. After 30 days, all patients are asked to repeat the treatment at 30, 60, and 180 days after the initial consultation. A second goal is to compare the cost of circumcision against topical treatment. We treat 59 patients aged 3 to 9 years old who have been treated with either steroid or placebo. They were divided into two groups: 29 received an 8- week course of ""topical"" treatment with 0.06 g/bmoletasol valerate or 170 children with no cure. Both groups had good results. However, they did not show any side effects after application of either type of cream. This study further investigates the use of topicals on boys as well as their histological characteristics. It was found that there was significant improvement in the response rate of both types of treatments. Another study was performed wherein 1178 boys from our outpatient hospital between 1991 and 2000 were examined. All patients underwent completecircumcision and surgery specimens were Typed Histologyly as early, intermediate, or late form of this disorder Or as non specific chronic inflammation. These patients were controlled at 1, 6, and 12 months Postoperatively then yearly. There was no association between the severity of the disease and the frequency of symptoms. Finally, another study showed that using stretching exercises could be used to reduce the risk of complications."
17389701,"The Nurses' Health Study is a prospective, case-controlled study of the association between blood levels of several inflammatory markers and risk of Type 2 diabetes in women who have no history of type 2 disease. In this study, we examine the relationship between body mass index, age, race, fasting behavior, and other factors that predict whether or not they will develop Type 2, as well as the relative risk for all three of these riskfactors. Women with BMIs greater than 29 are more likely to get Type 1, while those with less than 30 lose their weight. A diet high in fat, fiber, sucrose, sugar, or fiber may be associated with increased risk because of their lower body size. However, there are no significant associations between energy, protein, sucroed, carbohidrate, nor fiber. Thus, it is possible that consumption of dairy might reduce the risk among overweight African Americans. This study compares an eight-week low-calium diet with one of four high-calcicity diets: 900 mg of calcium daily; 500mg of alpha-alphaD3 per day; or 800mc/d of calorically restricted diet. It was found that patients lost only 6.4 percent of his body weight after 24 weeks on the highcalcium regimen."
23903267,"In this study, we examine the effects of different hypnosis on blood loss in patients who are undergoing radical Retropubic Prosatectomy. Epidural anaesthesia is more effective than general anesthesia for reducing blood losses during the procedure. We also investigate the efficacies of deliberate hypotention using combineded and general Anesthesia in preventing allogenec transfusions required by prostatutes. Most systematic reviews rely upon the assessment of method logical quality of individual trials. This study compares two different anesthesies in radical retro pubic prostactectomy with regards to blood Loss, Transfusional Requirements, Intraoperative Complications and Postoperative Pain control. The results indicate that there were no differences between the Demographic characteristics of the Two groups. Aim To evaluate the effect of epidual ropicanaine anemia in association with mild generalanesthesia during renal replacement and compare epileptic and endovenous analsis techniques for post-surgery pain control"
30977740,"This paper describes a study using wearable activity tracks to assess physical activity in healthy older adults. The results show that the wearer's waist, upper arm, and ankle are more active than those of other age groups. In this study, we examine the effect of wearing an activity monitor on people with knee Osteoartritis who have not yet met recommended treatment for the condition. We conclude that exercise is important for improving health but that there is little evidence of its efficacy when used alone or combined with cash incentives. Our aim is to compare an open-access, internet-based walk program to technology-in-person intervention in patients with obesity. A three-Arm cluster rand Omized control trial was designed to evaluate whether use of smartcare with nor without financial incentives could increase physical activities and reduce weight Over twilight period. Two-Week controlled trial designs were conducted to determine whether self-monitors can improve physical function in elderly patients. Physicians need to serve as roles for healthy lifestyle changes because long work hours lead to reduced time for healthier behavior. These studies focus on two specific areas: 1) physicians must be trained to help their patients lose weight; and 2) they must provide them with devices that will allow them to track their own progress. One such device is the ""Heyman"" which uses accelerometers to teach nurses how to use these devices to improve patient health. Another area is focused on women with breastcancer who suffer from excessive weight."
29260583,"The Berg balance scale is used as a measure of balance in people with several sclerosis. This study aims to determine the construct validity and predictors for walking ability and falls in patients who have multiple Scaffolds. In this paper, we examine the effect of an eight-week exercise program on balance and gait measures in persons with Multiple S Scufflets. We conclude that there are differences between the two groups in changes in the Bbs and in other measures: postural sow with eyes open, FGA, MS Walking Score, and ABC Scale. A fall risk assessment tool is needed to identify individuals at high risk for falling. There are no good fall prediction tools available; however, studies have shown that multifactorial approaches such as physical activity and strength training can be effective in preventing falls. However, further research needs to be performed to develop if fall prevention strategies can reduce serious injury rates. People with multiple diseases often experience frequent falls, which are related to impairments or limitations to activities/participants."
29513886,"The present study compares the efficacy and safety of two new restorative materials, Dyract and Contour, in treating primary morals over three years. In addition, the authors present a Bayesian Hierarchical Meta-Analysis to support comparisons between treatments."
29940543,"In this paper, Wu focuses on the effect of body mass-index on short-term and long- term outcomes after percutaneous translucl Coronary angiography or coronary heart bypass  Graft surgery. The results are mixed: patients with high BMI have better risk of complications than those with low Bmi; however, there is no concluding evidence for an association between high weight and mortality after these procedures."
32172501,"In this study, we assess the efficacity of a synthetic delta-9-thc dronabine in 30 patients who are taking opioids. The results of the first two trials show that patients receive an improved pain intensity and satisfaction compared to placebo. This is important because it shows that people respond better when they receive more than one type of treatment. We also report that there is no significant difference between group mean values for pain scores over time. Furthermore, these results do not reflect large differences in many patients. Medication Overuse headache has few evidence-base indications; however, several studies have reported that cannanbinol improves symptoms in patients with central pain. A double blinded, placebo controlled crossover trial was conducted in thirty patients suffering from multiple plexus injury or disease. These patients received either nabilione at 0.5mg/day or ibupropen 400mMg. They were then divided into three groups: 1) patients attended as outpatients but took the medicine at home; 2) patients attending as outside patients but did take the CME on their own; and 3) patients receiving both treatments orally for eight weeks before tablone and then IbuProfen or Vice versa. There was no major difference in primary outcome measures. For example, after obtaining baseline information, 42 subjects underwent'st andardized procedure' for inhalating four puffs of ""vaporized cannabis"" containing either low dose THC or high dose CB1 during the initial visit. After achieving baseline results, 40 subjects had 40%) completed the trial."
28914815,"This study focuses on the efficacy, safety, and cost of a ""culturely-tailored"" self-management program for low- income Latinas who have Type 2 diabetes. The primary endpoint is improved blood sugar control in patients with poor control. In addition, there are other risk factors for heart disease, stroke, or social support. After comparing the three groups, no significant changes in haemoglobin levels were observed at three months or at fifteen months. A further study was performed to determine whether 'culturally tailoring' an intervention for African American patients would be more effective than conventional care. It was found that this intervention was not only culturally appropriate but also highly effective in improving patient health. Although there was r and Omized controls in the United Kingdom, few controlled trials have been conducted to improve treatment for people with well-controlled type 2"
28826569,"This study uses information from the clinical trials to predict the tradeoff between benefits and risks, and concludes that using aspirin, statin or two blood pressure-reducing agents in all persons age 75 years or old would prevent newmyocardial ion and deaths from chest disease at acceptable cost. Aiming to assess whether fixed-dose combinations of aspidin/statin and twoblood-pressure-lowering agents improve long-termadherence to recommended therapy, theUMPIRE trial was a blinded endpoint trial among 2004, participants with established cardiovascular disease or at risk for CVD enlisted July 2010-juy 2011 in England and Europe. The aim of this study is to determine whether Fdd delivery of either asspiin nor statpin improves long term adherenceto indicated therapy and majorCVD risk factors: systelic blood tension, SBP, low- density lipomeprotein cholesterol, LDL- C. DESIGN AND SETTING, AND PURICIPants In this paper, we describe the results of an eight-week double-blinded trial comparing morning and evening dosing of sim vastatin with immediate-release regimens in healthy subjects. We compare the efficacity and tolerableness of three doses per day; the dosages employed are 2.5 and 5 Mg for 12 weeks. Simvastain has been developed in Korea and is being used as part of another product development project."
27061361,"A prospective, randomized, double- blinded study of forty-five patients who had atopic skin disease was performed. Forty five patients were included and treated for sixty days; group P,n = 11;, vitamines D and E pills: group D, 12; 1600 IU Vitamin D-3 plus vitamin E pillage; groups E, 10; 600 iu synthetic all-race--Tocopherol Plus vitamin D placebo; and group De, no more than 11. Seres 25-OH vs. plasma tocotheliorol were calculated before and after this trial. The subjects were divided according to their severity of the disease into four groups. In each group, they received either 1,800 mg of vitaminD or 800 hc/day of placebo. They were then divided into three groups with different doses of treatment. Each group consisted of 30 subjects with afflicted skin diseases. Thirty subjects in each category were assigned to receive either 4,000 molecalcifererol or 2500 ng/ day of natural origin. This was followed by 96 subjects given either 400 vile hawthorne extract or 500 vitriol per day. These subjects examined the effects of both treatments on blood levels of IgE as well as subjective symptoms. Both groups were equally effective in predicting whether infants' consumption of organic food was associated with an increase in the risk of developing these conditions later in life."
26556568,"The aim of this study is to determine whether or not treatment with an anotensin converting enzyme can reduce the risk of sudden death in patients with high-risk hypertension. In this paper, we describe a prospective, open-labeled trial of 6083 subjects aged 55-80 years who had mild to moderately elevated blood pressure and were treated with either triamtereene or amiloride. Both regimens significantly reduced blood tension but did not result in any significant changes in the severity of the disease. A further study was performed in which we compared the effect of calcium-channel blockinger niedipine twice daily with the drug combination coamizide on the rate of heart attack and mortality in elderly patients at high risk. This report concludes that there is no way to predict the efficacy nor effectiveness of antihystertinesive drugs in adults without compromising patient safety."
31618207,"In this paper, we describe the results of a pilot study in which we examined the effects of regular daily exercise on blood pressure, body weight, and psychological well being among patients with type two diabetes. We conclude that there is growing evidence for the use of yoga as an effective treatment for Type 2 diabetes but that it is not yet clear whether its benefits are efficacy or not. This paper reviews the available evidence on the efficacy of both conventional and rand-omized approaches to treating people with Type 2, particularly those with high risk of complications."
28715727,"In this paper, Dr. Rivers focuses on bipolar I patients who meet DSMIV criteria for the disorder. He discusses the effects of short- or long-term antidepresstant treatment in patients without major depressive symptoms. The efficacy is not as good as that of monotherapy alone. A prospective, random, placebo-control study has been conducted to assess the efficiacy and safetyof short term fluoxetine treatment over six months in Bipolar II patients with major depression. Although some physicians advocate using mood stabilizer therapy in treating these patients, no evidence exists against it. For example, one study suggests that an amitriptine-fluoxetine combination may be more effective than lamotrigin at preventing a manic switch episode. Another study shows that opipramine/fluoxetine combined with lithium reduces menic relapse by nearly double the risk of developing mania. This study furthermore describes the use of ""beating biphosphorus"" as an alternative treatment for bipole disorder since there is little evidence of side-effects."
28768649,"In this paper, we examine the effects of a high-protethrogen diet on bone mineral density and bone turnover in women who are pregnant. We conclude that menopause is associated with increased risk of estrogen substitutes, but soy has been used as an alternative to conventional treatment. This study investigates the effect of ""soy rich"" diet and progestesterone on Bone Mineral Densities at Postmenopalausal Age. The results indicate that there is little evidence for the efficaciousness of somber foods on improving bone health in early postmasal women. A double blind, rand Omized trial was conducted to compare the benefits of two different kinds of diets: 1) 'high-phosphorylated' wheat diet; and 2) low-phosphated grain diet. Women were divided into three groups according to their age and body mass. They were assigned to receive either 200 mg or 300 mg of each type of food. After six months, they were randomly assigned one of four groups: placebo group, 100mg/ day isoflavene, 160mb/day isotherve, or 80mc/d isorve. Both groups showed significant reductions in BMD after 6 months. These results suggest that these studies have not been sufficient to determine the most effective dose for reducing bone loss in later postmanopausals."
21056534,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective observational study in which men with localized or node-negative prostatecancer were randomized to either immediate or delayed adjuvant therapy. The primary aim was to evaluate the impact of rapid treatment on overall survival when added to lifetime ADT in patients with locally advanced caP. We conclude that it is unclear whether immediate and delayed administration of an antigen will extend survival for men who have previously undergone radical protoctectomy but not for those who receive only deferred or rogen desprivation. This study also determines whether long-term PSA double time is associated with increased risk of death from disease-specific disease."
23543567,"This paper focuses on the effects of an ""electrified-time"" blood glucose control system on patients with Type 2 diabetes. It is shown that this system can be very effective in relieving symptoms and improving quality of life for patients who have not yet received adequate care. In addition, it has been shown to improve self-management by increasing blood sugar concentrations. These results are further supported by the use of patient-generated blood pressure measurements as a measure of how well they are doing. The study also concludes that there is little difference between the usual care group and the newer type 2 group. Finally, the authors compare the effect of hand-held fingersticks on diabetic patients' health. They find that these devices work better than their conventional methods."
17636684,"In this paper, the authors describe a doubleblind, multi-centered, cooperative study to determine whether the combination of dipyramole -- aspirin -- and persantine will result in greater reduction of ""ceremonial or retinal"" infacracy or death than either treatment alone. The results are very similar. A double blind, omize-controlled trial compares the safety and effectiveness of aspidin and dipirida Mole for the secondary preventive effect of stroke after transient athemosclerotic attacks. Although there is little difference in major vascular events, survival curve analysis suggests that these two groups may have different primary endpoints: total mortality, all arteries, any major bleeding complications; or myocemic disease. After two years, no patient loses to follow up. There is no significant difference between the doses of both drugs except for side effects. Angina Pectoris has been treated with an extended series of antianginal treatments, but none of them can be found to be as effective as the other."
29334343,"In this paper, we describe a double blind, r-and-omized, placebo-control trial in Morocco to assess the efficacy and safety of direct vs. indirect supplementation for infants with idine deficiencies. We conclude that maternal Iodin concentration is essential for newborns' health; however, excessive levels have been reported among pregnant women in India. This study aims to establish reference ranges for Urinary Uic concentration in newborn babies in the first weeks after birth as an indication of their relative resorption of iron. The results of this study indicate that breast milk contains more uic than either pregnant or late-lactating women. A positive relationship exists between urinary ivic concentration and milk ibic level. Pregnacant women are less likely to receive urine compared to late mothers. Babies who were not breastfed during their first three months of life show greater sensitivity to urination than those who received euphoric ions."
27859780,"In this paper, we report on the results of a novel approach to measuring impulsivity amongst regular and current Ecstasies. We use an information sampling test to measure reflection in 46 current or previous e Cstasesy subjects, 15 current drug-nalive controls, and 19 drug/naive control subjects. Although elevated scores on these tests are not significantly different from the other patients, they do not differ significantly than those who have been using drugs before. Furthermore, there is no evidence for any significant difference in mood or anxiety between current and former escorts. Further studies suggest that exposure may be useful for treating anxiety disorders; however, it is not as effective as it could be. Finally, given that rand and Omized controlled trial are now investigating some doses of 3,4-Methodamhetamine in combination with psychological therapy for treatment-resisted anxiety disorder,we would like to suggests the following three mechanism for this possibly important new approach: 1) MDMA raises oxytochoin levels, which may strength the therapeutic alliance; 2) MdMA increases ventrominal prefrontal activities and decreases Amygdalsa activity,which may improve emotional engagement and enhanced extinction of learn fear associations; and 3) Medja increases norephinephine release and cortisole levels which might facilitate emotionalengagement and enhance annihilation of learned fear association. Thus, Dr. Manette's proposed approach has three potential effects: first, increased oxitocin concentrations, second, improved ventromedin pre frontal activity and third, reduced amygodala function. These effects were investigated by the multifaceted Empathy test, dynamic face emotion recognition task, social value orientation test -- SVO. The study also examines the neurotoxic effect of continued use of MDA over the courseof 1 year. It was found that continuing use had progressive decline in immediate and delayed remembering. However, further studies indicate that repeated exposure can induce long-term changes in serotonenic functions. This study concludes that ""MDMA"" produces long term reductions in Serotonic 5-Hippolytminic (5-HT) levels. A prospective cohort study is designed to assess the relationships between beginning use and subsequent mental performance in non-Drug-Nave controls."
24401226,"In this study, we investigate the effect of high-fructose consumption on lipids. We examine the association between high levels of trigglyceride and atheroscetic disease."
19244363,"In this chapter, we present the results of two large, well-respected studies on selenium and its anticancer potential. The first is a prospective, i.e. population-based study of 2907 Finnish men aged 50-69 who were eligible for alphatocotherol treatment in the Atbrain Cancer Prevention trial. We examine whether blood concentrations of selenium are associated with all-cure mortality. A meta-analysis of 19 trials suggests an increase in risk of total and cause specific mortality with high dose vitamin E. However, little is known about relation between mortality from low-dose supplements or both. This paper also discusses the use of antioxidant nutrients as preventive measures against nonmelanoca skin cancer. It concludes by comparing the efficaciousness of three different types of antioxidants: 1) randozed, doubleblind; 2) placebo-controlled; and 3) combination of vitamins and minerals."
29096908,"In this paper, we describe the ability of adult-aged girls with ADHD to predict functional outcome over a five-year period. We examine the association between childhood executive function and academic, social, andglobal functioning across an entire sample of predepressed girls in order to determine whether or not treatment for these children can be effective. The results suggest that adulthood is more likely to lead to long-term problems than early childhood development does. Methmylpheni dates are used to treat attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity disorder because they often improve executive functions. However, many studies have found that executive tasks do not accurately predict future behavior. For example, one study suggests that ""cool"" executive working memory and ""hot"" self-regulfment could aid in distinguishing among different types of ADHD. This study also describes the effects of multiple treatments on children with both Type 1 and Type 2 symptoms. After two years, however, there is no significant difference in the severity of the treatment group. A pilot intervention was designed to train parents to be ""friend coaches"" for their child's condition. Parents were assigned to receive parental friendship coaching as well as no treatment control groups."
18556637,"This paper focuses on the relationship between patient health status and utility measures. In this paper, we examine the relation between health values and mental health scores in patients with acute anemia. We find that there is a strong relationship amongst these two groups. For example, one patient's physical health score is related to his or her emotional well-being. Another patient has deterioration over time. The results of this study indicate that intermittent clausdication may be more cost effective than other methods of treatment for patients suffering from chronic pain."
30349359,"In this paper, we describe the use of a new approach to treating trigeminally neuralgian pain: using local submucousal and/or subdermal injections ofbotulinus toxin-A in patients with chronic typhoid nerve pain. This treatment has shown promising results in relieving pain for patients who have been unable to control their pain with conventional treatments. We present an efficacy study on 30 Egyptian patients treated with botuline toXin A as compared to placebo. The primary effect was reduction in painful severity on the 10cm visual analog scale; furthermore, improvement in pain frequency was observed at week 12 after follow-up visits. Further studies were performed on 24 patients from France, Belgium, and Brazil. These studies showed that botculinum tollin type A did not reduce severe pain in subjects suffering from throbbing pain caused by neuropox. However, there is some evidence that it may be useful in treating other types of pain such as palmar pain or carpal tunnel Syndrome."
29773575,"This study aims to assess the effect of reduced activity levels on adverse cardiovascular outcome in patients receiving cardiac heart failure therapy. The results of this study are compared with those obtained from two other studies. A model is developed using the measured values of the device's physical activity as predictors of mortality. In particular, it is shown that the use of an implantable defibrollator reduces the risk of death for patients who have received a cardiac-resynchronization treatment."
31328245,"In this paper, we report the results of an eight-year follow-up study on patients with bipolar disorder who have failed to respond either to or respond to long term lithium treatment. We examine the effect of bipolar disease on the efficaciousness of long-lasting treatment in vivo. Our primary aim is to determine whether short-term treatment can be used to prevent suicides in patients suffering from mood disturbances. This study uses a prospective random pooled population of patients aged between 42 and 57 years old who had been treated for their depressive disorder during the previous 20 years. The main outcome measures are the frequency of illness onset and severity of depression at different ages. After four years, these patients show greater severity but no early relapses"
17253526,"This paper focuses on the association between social disdain and sociodemographic factors in a sample of 304 adults drawn from Camberwell, South London. Men and women show poorer Social performance than women; men who do not live at home or have children show worse social performance as well. A new early-signs scale is developed to predict relapse for patients with Bipolar I disorder. In the United States, there are few studies examining the efficaciousness of family-based therapy for bipolar patients. Family-centered treatment is more effective than medication alone because it reduces the risk of mood disorder recurring. However, some studies have suggested that group psychoeducation may be useful in helping patients avoid revokes."
30926099,"In this study, we compare the success of three different endodontic agents in primary teeth after 18 months. The first agent is Biodentine; the second is mineral trioxidize aggregate; and the third is formocre sol. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of two different types of pulpotomies in children aged 5 to 9 years old. First, it is used to cover the pulp tissue with Biodedenine or mineraltrioxide aggregate before coronal pulp removes. Second, there is an attempt to use MTA as ""a 5mm Apical barrier"" by comparing its ability to seal ProRoot's Calcium Hydroxide to that of Matrimonial Titanium Aggregate. Finally, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of propolis extract, turmeric gel, and Ca-Hexide as pulp replacement agents for primary hysteria. It was concluded that these were the most efficacious treatments available. After ethical clearance, 75 healthy young 3 to 10 year old children each had at least onecarious primary tooth were selected for treatment. These were divided into four groups: 1) experimental 2) control 2) prospur extract, Turmeric gel /calcium HXide 3) proplast extract...and calcium hydroxides respectively. Each patient was assigned to either group. Twenty patients were followed clinically and radiographicly for over or 1 year. Both groups were restored with metal crowns"
19959485,"This paper reports on the results of an evaluation of maternal and child health services in a rural block of Jamnapur district in India. The results indicate that there are significant differences in the quality of care provided for children in different blocks of the city. In particular, immunation is better in one block than in another. Family planning has been largely neglected in Pakistan since the early 1990's. A new approach to improving child well-being was introduced in this paper. It focuses on ""integrated management of childhood illness"" or IMCI -- i.e., using case-management to improve patient access to primary care."
26876624,"This study focuses on the effects of regular diabetes health education on Type 2 patients in Hong Kong. The aim is to assess whether such programmes can be used in primary care. In this study, we examine the effect of lifestyle changes on weight loss and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. We conclude that exercise is the best prediction for long-term fat loss. A self-management program designed specifically for older women with type two diabetes has been shown to be effective in preventing weight gain and elevated waist circumference. However, it is not possible to use this information to predict how well the intervention will work."
26083089,"This study focuses on the bonding strength of a fiber-post luting system to partial crowns. Thirty four patients were treated with two different types of cements, one without enamel etcheding and another with selective enameletching. The results are as follows: A patient's tooth is restored after 12 months, 24 hours, 36 months; for statistical analysis, the Chi Square test was applied. In this study, thirty-four patients have been treated in split-mouth designs using either RXU or RxU + E. After six months of treatment, restorations are evaluated at baseline, bleak, and after twelve, 24, and 36 month. For comparison, Chhexidine and EtOH had no significant effects on both bond strength and sealability. To evaluate the effect of push-out bonds strength, fiber posts were cemented by five different cement systems. Fortymaxillary canine roots were assigned to each group according to cement assessment: RelyX unicem Aplicapp, Panagia 21 / Panavia Cement...Relyix Unicemp Aplicap....Varolink II VAR? Various cement groups were divided into eight groups. Each group consisted of twenty-five fiber post sections. All teeth were restored using Parabo FiberLux. Parapost Firlux was used to restore fifty single-rooted root segments. Posts were then cetered with various stains on three segments of the plant. These cementations were followed by an 8-year controlled clinical trial. It was found that the adhesive performance of clearfil SE was superior to that of other treatments. However, it was not possible to predict whether the success of these experiments would be due to failure mode."
29115188,"In this study, we examine the effects of a workstation that is height-assisted on workers' sitting time and their vascular, metabolic, and muscuoskeletal outcomes. We compare the efficacies of two different approaches to reduce office sitting: 1) an eight-week sit-stand program and 2) an electric height adjustable work station. The results show that working in seated positions leads to reduced pain and improved work performance relative to standing work. This study also focuses on the use of short rest breaks to prevent back pain from occurring."
23450577,"This paper presents the results of a three-year, cross-examined intervention to improve health in American Indian middle school students. It is shown that the high repetition and moderate load exercise groups have significant gains in physical activity than the control subjects. The trial was designed to test whether an intervention with heart-rate Feedback prompts increased Physical activity in underservated adolescents. In this case, it is found that only the High Repetition / Moderate Loaf exercise group has any significant effect on changes in body composition or weight gain. A further study is performed to determine whether children's knowledge about physical activities can be improved by using self-reporting methods. These studies are followed by two other studies concerning overweight and obesity: one in which schools use ""eclectic informed social cognitive"" theories to inform interdisciplinary approaches; and another whereby parents engage their children in community-based exercises to prevent over-indulgence."
28153024,"In this study, we examine the association between lipophosphoprotein-a phose A2 levels and myocardialty in three studies of white people from Denmark. The results are similar to those reported in the two studies. For example, for elevated Lipoprotein concentrations, there is a significant increase in risk of heart attack. We investigate whether statins can reduce lipodyprotein level in patients with Type 2 hypercholestemia or type 4 hyperlipidemia. Our aim is to determine whether combination therapy will be more effective than simvastain alone in treating these patients. This study compares the effects of simpvastatin with fenorate on lipogenetic activity in subjects with combined hyperlipemia: elevated trigglyceride -- levels / 100 and 175 mg/dal ; LDL-c> 160mg/Dl. Furthermore, our goal is not only to evaluate the effect of combination treatment but also to assess the safety and efficiacy of statmins as compared to other antihyperlipidic drugs."
25236307,"In this study, we examine the effects of a combination of Lactobacterium acidophilus and Bfidobacillus on infants who are very low birth-weight. The results indicate that both groups have significant reductions in the risk of developing necrotizing Enterocolitis when compared to control groups. A double blinded, placebo-control study was conducted on 231 premild babies weighed from 750 up to 1499g at birth. This study showed that probiotic use had little effect on the incidence of Necterizing enterocotis in preterm children. However, there were some reports that it was more effective for early-onset disease to be treated with probiota than by feeding alone. We conclude that these studies suggest that using Probiotics may reduce the severity of neonates' nosocomic infections."
31114271,"The purpose of this study is to examine the perceptions of patients about barriers to their self-care in order to identify ways to help them manage their disease. Four focus groups are conducted among 31 African American patients who were referred to as ""predominately Arab American"" by the National Heart Bank. The topics consisted of questions about current health status, medication use, continuation of care, blood glucose levels and nutrition. This trial test an integrated self management program on outcomes of heart failure and diacyptism. Aim: To compare Montreal Cognitive Assessment to St and Ardized mini-mental status exam for diagnoseing mild intellectual impairment in Type 2 Diabetes mellitateus population. Methods: We surveyed 878 type 2 diabetes patients from twoprimary care centers using the Harvard department of psychiatry or National depression screening day scale. Results: Of the patients, 19% met thecrite major depression, H and S score / 9; and an additional 56.5 % had at least somedepressive symptoms. In addition, patients with depressed symptoms reported significantly less days following diet, exercise, and medicine adherence than other patients. Prevalence of Type 2, Diabetes Mellitus has reached epidemic levels worldwide. There is considerable international variation in susciption between susceptibility and risk factors ofT2D, with Pacific Indians and Europeans being considerably more susceptible to develop the condition. Knowledge of modifiably risk factor of T2DA is important, as it form the basis for designing cost-effective prevention and therapeutic strategiesto slow the epidemicin population sat at increased risk. Self-efficace was not directly involved by depression and sugar distress, but indirectly through depression -- path coefficient = 0.304, p1.001. These results suggest that there is a significant increase in the number of people with Type 1, especially those with mental illness."
25008420,"This study focuses on the effects of moderate-intentioned physical activity on physical function performance in older adults. It is shown that exercise training improves heart rate variability, which is associated with increased risk of mortality. In this study, we investigate whether exercisetraining improve blood pressure and health outcomes in postmanopausaal women who have mild balance dysfunction. The results suggest that there may be some benefit to exercise therapy in improving health for older people without significant decline in body mass or strength. We also examine the association between fitness and ageing over an eight-year period. A high- intensity exercise program was used to improve walking, prevent falls, and increase physical activities among stroke patients. Furthermore, it was found that elderly people with functional disability were more likely to develop disease than those with no such disability. Strength training is an important practice for aging females because it helps keep strength and function while reducing risk for long-term diseases."
28258581,"Aas abuse is associated with infertility among recreational power-athers. Eight healthy male power men are compared to those who have not been treated with this type of treatment. After six years, the study finds no significant differences between the two groups. Meth and Ienone, an ""anabolic"" steroid used by athletics, were studied in 11 men during weight-training. The subjects gained considerable weight but did not show any changes in their performance over the course of the treatment; however, they showed signs of increased strength and performance."
19608724,"This study aims to investigate the efficaciousness of bathing on patients with Fibromya Syndrome. It is a prospective, blinded observational study in which 24 patients are assigned to two groups: group 1 receives 20-min spa treatment and group 2 receive no such treatment. Forty eight patients were divided into four groups as follows: Group 1 received sulfur baths; group 2, received only plain water; and control group received no other treatment at all. In this study, we examine the effect of mud packs combined with antidepressive therapy on pain and tenderness. We conclude that muddy bath treatments can influence the pituital adrenal axis, leading to increased levels of corticotropichormone, cortinsol, and beta endorphin Serum levels."
29909748,"Telehome care is a promising new approach to improving the quality of care for older patients with Type 1 diabetes. In this study, we examine the effect of telemedicine on blood glucose control in adult patients who have type 1 disease. The results are similar between the two groups. We conclude that ""mobile technology"" can improve patient-reported outcomes and improved glyciemic control among adults with type 2 disease because it uses advanced medical information technologies. This paper also discusses the relationship between long-period intervals and increased risks of sudden death. It reports that an intervention using Welltang could reduce the risk of complications by reducing the time from the start of hypogycemia to major events."
22115901,"The aim of this study is to investigate whether blood pressure lowered and intensified glucose control would improve the incidence and progress of retiinopathy in type two diabetic patients. A substudy of ADVance, a controlled 2 x 2 factorial trials, was conducted with an open comparison between blood-stained blood levels and perindopriml - indapacami vs placebno or utmost intensity of glucose controls. This trial showed that strict glyciamic control was superior to conventional treatment in terms of improved peripheral nerve function. In addition, these results were associated with shorter post-survival time and reduced wound infection. These results suggest that ""pioglitzazone"" may be able to reduce the morbidities and mortality of patients with Type 2 diabetes."
25841251,"This study demonstrates that a blood pressure-monitouring system can be used to improve the control of hypertension in patients with severe heart disease. It is shown that this system works well in an interventional setting and that it reduces the risk of death by reducing body weight, height, waist circumference, sum of Skinfolds, Blood pressure, total cholesterol levels, and predicted exercise capacity. The aim of this paper is to compare the effects of self-management on cardiovascular risk factor reduction among healthy overweight employees who are not participating in cardinal rehabilitation. In this trial, 223 subjects were assigned to either ""CardinalFit"" or usual care; they received personal health advice and tracked their physical activity for six months. A nurse led telerisk factor management program was designed to promote self maintenance on top of normal care as opposed to usual treatment alone in preventing atheroscomatose patients from developing acute coronary diseases. Two arm randomized trials were conducted in primary care centers in Spain: one group received short messages to provide information about diabetes related information in cutting the rate of developing diabetes mellitateus over 12 weeks; the other group had regular care but no change in lifestyle. Cardiovascular disease has been neglected in Western society because of its high mortality and cost. However, employers have begun to offer work health services using web-based tools to track and provide guidance on patients' health risk. These approaches have been unsuccessful in many cases. For example, we have found that diet counseling does not improve blood cholesteration but only modestly improves fat absorption. We also find that there is little evidence regarding the effectiveness of these two approaches in improving patient health. Heart disease is primarily underused in general practice although some studies have suggested that medical and lifestyle changes may be more effective than conventional medicine."
21527847,"In this paper, we describe a novel approach to blood pressure control. We use telemedicine to track blood-pressure in patients who have been uncontrolled by monotherapy and then compare it to the cost of using ambulatory homeblood pressure measurements. This study is an attempt to determine whether self-tiration of hypertension will be more effective than usual care alone. The results suggest that people who receive conventional care or escorts from their primary care centers will have greater reductions in blood flow after 12 months than those who only receive regular care."
26851599,"The aim of the present study is to examine efficacy in transcutaneous electrical tension on bladder symptoms in older women with obstructive overactive bladder. A double blinded, placebo-control trial was conducted on 51 patients with ""strange bladder syndrome"" who received 12 weeks of exercise and physical therapy. After treatment, they reported improvement in their urine frequency and severity. In addition, there were no significant changes in pre- or post-treatment Urodynamic Scores. Amys investigates the effect of magnesium on pressure and volume measurements in women suffering from detrussome overactivity. She compares two different dose levels of magesium to determine whether it can be useful for women experiencing urinary inconstinence. Both groups report improved results. Overactive Blader Syndrome is a common disorder that often require long-term treatments. There are several new approaches to treating this disorder. For example, acupuncture has been shown to be more effective than other forms of treatment; however, many studies have failed to show any positive effects. These include an outpatient telemedicine service, which uses heat and steam to treat pain."
26130315,"Estrogen replacement therapy has been shown to improve quality of life among postmenopalasal women, but little is known about its efficacy in preventing or reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke. In this study, we examine the effects of two estrogen-replacement regimens on mood and anxiety in healthy older women. We conclude that estradiolation seems to have a beneficial effect on depressive symptoms as well as on mental health in older females. Although there is some evidence that progestine may be an effective treatment for depression, few studies have examined the effect of either regimen on other conditions. For example, one study suggests that use of progesterin can lead to changes in sleep and mood. Another study uses positronemissiontomography to assess regional cerebral bloodflow in young women after four months of continuous hormonal replacement treatments. This study compares the affects of three different forms of antidepressants: morphine, estranol, and cyclicidal progessterone. The results suggest that these drugs are more effective than placebo in treating depression."
26885527,"In this paper, Wu focuses on the cost of lifestyle intervention for people with Type 2 and Type 3 diabetes who are at high risk. He uses a case-control study to assess the efficacy of an eight-week lifestyle change program in reducing type 2 disease by comparing the effects of daily exercise and weight loss counseling to those of control groups. The results suggest that these two approaches may be more cost effective than other approaches."
28488799,"In this study, we aim to investigate the effects of chemoradotherapy on patients' physical fitness. We studied 12 patients who had rectal cancer and were treated with st or ardized Neoad Juvant Chemoradiotherapies between October 12, 2012 and July 13, 2013. The patients underwent an exercise test before and after treatment and their performance was compared in terms of muscle function and body composition. This study is important because it will identify risk factors that can be included in a multimodifiable pre-habilitation program for patients with colorecently advanced disease. Prehabilitations are often used as an alternative to conventional care since they increase functional capacity during recovery. However, many studies have found no evidence of improvement in post-surgery outcome."
32024269,"In this study, we examine the effects of an eight-week exercise program on patients suffering from occupational burnout. We conclude that it is possible to improve physical health by reducing fatigue and improving state affect. Aiming to provide further evidence for the use of exercise as a treatment for patients who suffer from exhaustion, Halliday suggests that aerobic exercise may be more effective than other forms of therapy. The results of this trial are reported in several articles. For example, Chmielewewski reports that patients with chronic back pain receive either low intensity exercises or motor control exercises. Van Beijsterheildt also reports no differences in injury among amateur football players when usual care were compared against another exercise strategy that consist of core stability, eccentric trainingof thigh Musculoskeletal studies are common ; however, many studies have found no difference in the preventiveness of injuries between amateur men and those who received conventional care. This study investigates the effect of six weeks of vigorous exercise on work-regular fatigue. All subjects were assigned to one of three groups: 1) 'electrification' 2) /mobility'3) 4) plyoscopic exercise. After two weeks, they were divided into four different groups. They were measured before and after their intervention. Brain Plasticity outcomes included Magnetic resonance spectropography, quantitative image-based hip pocketcaptal volume and bdnf serum levels. Confounder controlled correlation revealed significant association of brainplasticity outcome with physical activity yet not with performance."
12137717,"In this paper, the authors describe a system for infants to be fed and treated in order to prevent their development of an allergic reaction. They use Lactobacilus GG, formerly known as ""ATCC 53103"", to treat all breast-fed babies with eczyma or cow's milk allergies. The study is followed from birth until age 18 months. All mothers are advised to avoid tobacco smoke, furrepets, dust collecting material in the bedroom, and daily exposure to dogs and pets. This group is compared with control groups consisting of54 identically defined high-risk children born in 1985 who have been studied prospectively at birth. A total number of 105 preterm infant girls were studied prospectsively frombirth to 18months of age. Preventive care was recommended; however, there was no difference in maternal IgG levels or allergic reactions between these groups. There was also no significant differences in family history scores or blood pressure among the different groups because they had not been breastfed during the first four months of life. As previously reported, increasing numbers of asthma-related illnesses have led to attempts at prevention. These include feeding different infant formulations on the frequency of disease and the effect of eating different formulas upon the severity of symptoms. One such study examined the relationship between infant feeding practice and childhood respiratory illness, height, weight, body composition,and bloodpressure. It was concluded that those who received either type of diet had better motor development than those without it. However, some studies suggest that early diet may influence later brain development in man."
29930690,"The aim of the present study is to determine whether alpha- lipoicacia, ALA, can be used as an antioxidative agent in patients with chronic kidney failure. In this paper, we report on the effects of a daily dosage of alpiolic acid on inflammation, malnutrition, and other markers of disease in subjects with hemodylysis. We conclude that if these measures are taken regularly, they may help to reduce the risk of heart attack."
30519027,"In this study, we assess the safety and effectiveness of amorphose-based antipsychotic treatment in children with an autistic condition. We conclude that it is safe and efficacious to treat irritable symptoms in infants and children who have severe or persistent tantrums. Aiming to determine whether rispiron can be used as compared to placebo for treating audistic disorder, our group conducts relap-prevention studies in patients aged 6 to 17 years. The results of these studies indicate that if given at doses sufficient to improve behavior, there is significant improvement on the Autism Rating scale."
27647000,"In this paper, Dr. Holmwood focuses on the use of evidence-based practice guidelines to improve patient care in rural Australia. He uses a single cohort study to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveity of an interprofessional, health care professional pain education program for patients with back pain in four rural Western Australia regions. This intervention is compared to ard and st dissemination. The outcome measures are self-reported satisfaction with the treatment provided by the supervised physiotherapist. A multifaceted strategy was developed to implement the clinical guidelines on physical therapy as well as mental health issues. Adherence scores were measured by individual patients' forms recording their treatment completed by his musculotic ostess. Cost effectiveness of two low back Pain Guideline implementation strategies: one that consisted of passive guidance; and another that involved multiple approaches. It was aimed at reducing the costs of both methods. An economic evaluation was carried out alongside these studies to assess the impact of active implementation on primary care practitioners' adherence toward the guidelines. Peer assessment was more effective than peer assessment in improving knowledge and decision-making in the Dutch Physical Therapy Guidebook for Low Back Pain."
28547135,"In this paper, we examine the relationship of sitting time and death in a sample of 17,113 Canadians aged 18-90. We examined daily sitting times, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity as predictors of mortality. The results showed that there was 1832 deaths from cardiovascular disease and 547 from cancer during follow-up. This study is aimed at examining the association between different types of sedentaries and bone mineral content among young Canadian girls and boys. A population of 277 females and men aged 13.0- 18.5 years within framework of the multi centre AVEN study were involved in this study; Bone mineralcontent, lean Mass,and fat mass were calculated with DXAC. Physical activity had been associated with increased fracture risk for boys and girls over the age of 11 and 16 years respectively. Suprie weight bearing exercise alleviated some ofthe skeletal deconditioned induced by ""simulated weightlessness"" in men while dietation was controlled. Unlabelled The effect of sports participation on upper arm fractures was investigated in these population based case control studies with three21 age-matched pairs. These cases included children 9-16 years of age who took measurements of their height, weight, activity, food, etc. They also examined the relation between bone area and gain in pre-schoolers. Children's measured body size, waist circumference, length, height/weight, activities, meal, sleep, health, blood, urine, causticity, calcium, vitamin D, propensity for drinking, sleeping, or playing games."
24161014,"In this paper, we describe the results of a three-cohort study of patients with end-stage ankle arthritis who received an implanted prosthesis. We report that the initial patient population was Scandal and Anavian Total Annkle Replacements, while the second group was Star total ankle patients. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the safety andefficacy of an ankle-replacement device for patients suffering from rheuumatoisd arthritis. A prospective observational study is performed in which Forty seven consecutive patients were treated with cementless ankle replacements by one surgeon. Although the outcome of these studies is uncertain, it is clear that they are of high quality."

30383133,"Apixaband for Reduction In Stroke or Other Throstombolic events in Atrial fibrillations. The aim of this study is to determine the cost and efficaciousness of apoxaban treatment in patients with acute atrial fibrillation. This analysis uses patient level information from the Aristatorle trial, a multicentre clinical trial that examined 18 201 US patients for 1.8 years during 2006 and 2011. We assess the association between Comorbid Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and risk ofstroke or systemic Emolism and other risks. Our results indicate that warfarin can reduce the risk by preventing stroke but increases the severity of bleeding. Dabigan is an effective antithrombin agent; however, it has several limitations. A post-hoc analyze of the aristitated evaluation of long-term anticipation therapy was performed. Warfari reduces therisk of stroke in those with atrium fibrilation but increasesthe riskof hemorrhaage and is hard to use. Edoxapan is able to prevent stroke without increasing the rate of blood loss. These studies are important because they include patients who have been previously treated with war farin or warbigatran. They also examine the effect of aspirin on the safety of either regimen. Although there is no direct treatment cost associated with these trials, few studies know how much money is saved when patients receive both drugs."
19496021,"This paper focuses on the use of quality-of-life measures in health planning, medicine, and social science. It uses the concept of response shift to argue that patients may change their own judgments about what is important to them as they move from one illness to another. In this paper, we examine the changes in individual quality of living over time using the SeIQol, a new instrument for measuring life's quality. We compare the value of the five quality areas measured by the Self-Anxiety and depression Questionnaire with the values found in the Five Quality of Life Areas Measured in Long-Term Stem Cell Transplantation. The results show that most patients are satisfied with their lives after stem cell transplantations. However, there is little difference between the satisfaction of these areas and those found elsewhere."
32111637,"This paper describes a novel approach to treating patients with dissipative seizures using brief Augmented Psychological Interpersonal Therapy. It is shown that BAPIT can be used as compared to other approaches for treating the symptoms of these patients. In this study, we assess the efficacy of brief augmented psychological intervention on patients who have dissociative no-epileeptic seizures. We also describe remission of symptoms in patients treated with behavior therapy or routine medical care."
25886655,"In this paper, the authors describe a double blinded study of 136 children who had been assigned to Clon alone, M. Ph alone or combined with Clon-XR in combination with other stimulant medication. The results showed significant improvement for subjects assigned either to ""CLon"" or ""M. P. .003"" and that they were not treated with placebo. A further study was conducted on 45 children with attention deficit disorder/hyperactivité disorder. This study examined the effects of three doses of Oros methylphenis date on academic performance, classroom behavior, and aggression among 45 patients. Although no significant improvements occurred between the two groups, there was an increase in the greatest benefit from the lowest dose. Children with mental retardations and attention-deprived hyperactivity disorder also received treatment with m.p.h.i.r. as well as with another drug called clonine. They found that more than half of the patients improved on the conduct and hyperactive index scales when compared to controls. Another study is performed on Canadian children aged 6 to 13 years old who are prescribed gxr by their parents. It is concluded that guanfranfacine extend release has shown promising efficacy in treating attentiondeficits and hypoperactivity disorders. Clonidine extended release can be used together with stimulants such as morphine or amphetantamine for treatment of ADHD."

We compare the results of three different forms of treatment: continuous intraperitoleal insulin infusing, constant subcutificial insulininfusion, and direct costs for type 1 diabetes. The main aim of this paper is to determine the reliability and validity of the Thai versions of Well-Bee Index, which is easy to use by primary care patients. This study was carried out over eight months from March 1st to October 31, 2002 in the three villages of Udpi, Kandapura, or Karkala; belong to the Udasi district of south India. It was concluded that depressive symptoms were more common among the elderly than among other groups of people. A sample of 3,660 subjects who underwent physical examination, physical exam, blood tests, depression measures, using CESD scales as an assessment of severity. These studies are part of Dr. Bench's ""DAWN-2 Initiatives"" and will be used to improve not just the medical care but also patient centerred outcomes."
24100440,"In this study, we examine the effects of a pre-colic diet on infants with colic who are breastfed. We find that the addition of Lactobacterus reuri to infant formula is an effective strategy to improve symptoms of infancy. The safety and tolerance for probiotics are examined in this first-trimeval study. After six months, the efficaciousness of the treatment is determined. A group consisting of fifty infant girls aged 5 months were assigned either to receive L'reuteri or placebo. Their primary outcome measures was the reduction in daily crying time at least 50 %; and the duration after randomization. This trial showed no significant difference in weight gain over the next three weeks."
32346802,"In this paper, we examine the effect of two different anti-inflammatory drugs, saffreon and indolethacin, on delayed-onset muscles soreness. We use a double blinded, placebo controlled trial to assess the effects of these two drugs on pain perception and muscle strength after nine months of resistance training. The results indicate that ibupropen has no negative effects on bone and muscular health in postmenstrual women. However, there is some evidence that consumption of cyclooxigenases can interfere with the beneficial effects that exercise training has upon reversation of spasms in older adults. This study investigates the efficacy of prophyllactic administration of an over-the counter aspirin for improving endurance performance in runners who are suffering from acute ankle pain. It is concluded that naproxen may be more effective than other antiinflammatory drugs in relieving leg pain caused by eccentric exercise."
25262686,"Two hundred four patients symptomatically for paroxysesmal or persistent atrial fibrillation were assigned to two different ablation strategies: pulmonary vein isolation and pulmonary vein plus left linear lesions. The main end point was the maintenance of SinrhythmRhythm after procedures 1 through 2 in the absent of antiarthroic drugs in long term follow up of at least three years. Paroxysedmal AF is treated with one procedure at 12 months, while using the ""PVI plus L"" at the 3 year follow-up. After another second procedure, the overall efficacy rate without anarrhythmic medication was 62 percent with PVI alone and 85 p.. This paper discusses the results of several small single-centre studies that suggest that atrium fibrillation can be improved by either adsorption on the lungs or by omizing the blood vessels. In this study, we compare the success of both methods in terms of quality of life. We conclude that there is no difference between the short-term success rate of RFA and AADs when compared to those who receive conventional therapy. Our aim is to determine whether or Not radifrequency abulation for persistently attracted atonic fibrilation leads to improvement in cardiac function in advanced heart failure patients. To date, however, it has been difficult to find out whether these patients have reduced their sytolic function. Therefore, our goal is now to assess the effect of phosphorus vein separation on right ventricular strain and strain rates in patients with severe left valvular dysfunction. These patients are divided into two groups according to the maintaining of sinus rhythm during follow down. At 16 months after abjection, 19 patients had recurrent feigning aff. Another study investigates how effective circumferential lung vein isolated treatment may be in relieving symptoms of acute attriotic drug use in congestive hearts.

32350578,"The two surgical strategies for total kneearthroplasty are described. A measure resection method is used to guide the bone cuts equal to the dital and posterior Thickness of the Femoral Component or a Gap-Balging approach, in which equally collateral ligament tensions in flexion/extension is tried before and as an guide to final bones cuts. In this paper, we compare the results of both methods on joint line position, gap balaling, and function. Both methods show improved results when comparing pre-opportunity deformities. Two different surgical techniques are presented: ""measured reasection technique"" and ""gap balancencing technique."" These two approaches have shown superior results up to 10 year post-operative time."
26146874,"In this study, we examine the effects of bromomecriptine on smoking behavior in patients with low dopamine levels. We conclude that genotypes for the D and Bgr.H gene are useful for predicting which patients will respond better to treatment. The results suggest that those with lower levels of Dopa-hydroxylase activity show greater craving for alcohol than those who have higher levels; however, they also show no differences in their response to either treatment or placebo. Lanzapine is being used as an outpatient treatment for cocaine dependent patients. A prospective open-label cohort study was conducted at a single primary care institution in Edinburgh. 794 patients had been treated with opiate substitutes during 1990-2005. This population included 557 patients who had not received any other form of treatment until one year later. They were followed up from first dose to long term Cessation. These patients should be considered when considering survival and long-term cessations of drug use."
18199086,"In this study, we examine the effect of early breast feeding on infants' atopies in the first two months of life. We conclude that there is no significant difference in family history or IgG levels between groups; however, after 4 months, both groups do not have significantly different reactions to milk. A prospective follow-up cohort of healthy children follows up from birth until age 6 years. The results indicate that exclusive breastfeeding does not reduce the risk of developing anamnesic disease and that cow's milk has some protective effects against it. This study also investigates the relationship between maternal asthma and breast feed. It was found that mothers who avoided dairy were more likely to develop asthma than those who did not. However, these studies suggest that pregnant women may be at greater risk for developing asthma when they are breastfed."
27769955,"In this paper, we describe a six-month web-based treatment for older adults with Type 2 diabetes. The results show significant improvement in quality of life, depression, social support, and selfefficacy. We also examine the effect of an eight-week intervention on patients' health over time. A1c is the primary outcome, but there are no significant differences between group groups. Self-management behavior was found to be improved in both groups; however, it was not clear whether these improvements were due to changes in self-resources or simply because they did not fit into the larger picture of disease management. This study concludes that ""disease management may improve blood glucose control by enforcing contact between high risk patients and their care managers."""
26552695,"This study focuses on the effects of two rest-breaks and stretching exercises in workers with low back pain. The results indicate that rest breaks reduce neck pain and shoulder pain, while stretching exercise increases muscle strength and oxygen uptake. Neck pain is particularly common among office workers because it is associated with multiple risk factors. A participatory return to work program for sick-listed workers has been developed. In this study, self-employed workers are assigned to either an intervention group or control group by cluster randomization. Workers are divided into three groups: 1) ergonomics intervention; 2) physical training without any cognitive behavioral component or workplace specific exercises; and 3) PTCBWe. They are then given instructions to implement these measures within 3 months. Back at work, there is no difference in the effectiveness of both types of training. For example, one group uses a track ball to reduce upper body pain as well as lower arm pain when compared to another group which uses only mechanical support. Both groups have improved their neck and shoulders pain over the next six months after the first intervention. Another study examines the efficaciousness of using ambulant Myofeedback to prevent neck/shouldar pain in industrial workers. It was found that the use of myofed therapy reduced neck injuries but did not improve health-related qualities of life. Two studies examined the effect of raising bricklayers' posture on injury and disease. One study investigated the benefits of working with less elevated hands and muscles during complex worktasks. Other studies looked at how different workstation habits were affected by various kinds of stress and fatigue. These studies included several studies concerning ""musculoskeleton disorders"" including those caused by repetitive motion, heavy lifting, and vibration. Musculonoskeletal disorders include headaches, neckaches, shoulder problems, arms and legs."
17943751,"This study focuses on the effect of three different diets on women's health. The first is a wheat-based diet, which has high amounts of soy and low-in-protethrogens; the second is an herb-rich diet with high levels of progesterin. In this study, we examine changes in menopause symptoms from baseline to after 12 weeks. We find no significant differences between the two groups, but when compared separately, they have significantly higher urinary Excretion of Progestin than those consuming High-Protetenetogen diet: p /  0.01. Context The effects of continual combined hormone therapy upon gynic cancers have never been investigated before in r and Omized trial settings. Estrogant treatment does not increase risk for stroke or death among postmenopanal women who receive conventional therapy. However, there are some studies that suggest using phytoestroganes as an effective treatment for these conditions. A double blind, parallel group, outpatient, multi-centre, Rando controlled trial of 16608 postmanopausals females aged 50-65 years who experienced five or more Hot flusheses per day were assigned to either one of the following regimens: 1) Soy IsofLAvone extract, 26 mg Biochanin A, 16 mg Formononetine, 1 Mgenistein, and 0.5 Mdaidzen ; 2) Plants contains compounds with ostrogenten -- like actions called phytostagons. Thus, it is possible that plants may act as anti-osteganics against breast cancer. Furthermore, our aim is to determine whether any change in mammography breast denition, serum blood count, lymphocyte cell tyrapine activity, etc. affects hot flushing frequency in postparous women. After six weeks, both groups show marked reductions in severity of cold flushations. Women receiving sory flour reduced their mean number of bouts of hot flashiness by 40 % over twelve weeks while placebo-treated women showed similar results. These studies indicate that plant-derived isotherves can be useful in treating such diseases as breastcancer."
28368091,"In this paper, we examine the use of the positive and negative syndrome scale as a measure of severity for patients with mild to moderately severable schizophrenia. We compare the scores of these scales with those of ClinicalGlobal Impressions, an instrument used to calculate the severity of symptoms in multiple-centre antipsychotic trials. Our results indicate that treatment is more effective than usual care when compared to ""mildly"" illness. Acute psychological illnesses can be difficult to treat because they involve agitation or physical nonaggressivity. Although there are many available treatments for treating these conditions, few have been published. This paper uses standardized methods to assess the efficacy of different types of therapy for people with severe mental illnesses. It also uses unpublished measures to determine whether any association exists between using unscientific measures and finding significant effects in studies."
32340106,"In this study, the effect of a single-rooted root canal on the strength of an eight-mm post is investigated. The results indicate that the post can be used as either shorter or longer posts. Posts are divided into 10 groups and each group is treated with different cements to achieve the desired bond strength. A pullout test is performed to determine the influence of the mechanical testing method on tooth growth. Thirty teeth are prepared for fiberposts in three groups: 1) conventional treatment without laser; 2) Nd /YAG Laser; and 3) sub-no post at all. This study compares the effects of two different treatments on dentin integrity. One treatment involves using phosphorus permanganates to remove the ""smear"" layer from the root while the other uses polyvinyl chloride to increase the pulpit's ability to withstand high pressures."
27798366,"In this study, we assess the efficacy of two months of postmyo Cardioval Ion resuscitation on total work-capacity and health- related quality of life. We compare the effects of home-based heart-recovery training with hospital- or outpatient exercise training for patients older than75 years. The results show that both groups improve their physical activity scores in the same time period. This is an important finding because it suggests that there may be a significant difference in selfefficacy between people who perform physical activities and those who do not."
32198100,"In this paper, we describe a novel approach to preventing surgical wound infection in patients who have undergone major surgery. We examine the effects of hypothermic care on patient survival and injury during major open-thoracic or colorectric surgery as well as an attempt to use wound photographs to track patient outcome. This paper also discusses the use of positive pressure wound therapy with elderly patients for reducing post-surgery complications."
24564520,"In this paper, we examine the effects of a cash transfer program in improving health care for poor women in Mexico. We find that the program leads to significant increases in the rate of immunizing children against meases and other childhood diseases. The results are especially impressive for children who may not be able to afford traditional supply- side intervention. This paper also discusses the use of conditional cash loans as an incentive to improve child health. It is shown that these loans lead to large increases over time in both maternal and child outcomes."
17563549,"This is a small, double blinded study that compares the effect of two anotensin I type 1 receptor blockingers on blood pressure and pulse pressure measured in the hospital, at home, and with hamper-to-hand measurements. The results are very similar: Lisisolopril is more effective than Losartan for reducing diastonic blood flow. A comparison of the antihysterical efficacy between valsaran and amlorodipine has been made. In this trial, patients were divided into three groups: 1) patients who had mild to moderately essential hypertension; 2) those who did not have any other risk factors; and 3) those with no other known risk factor. Both drugs showed significant reductions in mean daily bloodpressure during the first four hours after awakening. These patients received either telmalan or vascaran as monotherapy. They also reduced their sit-sickle blood pump by nearly one millhg per day. Blood pressure continues to be poorly controlled in these patients because they are unsatisfied"
30861690,"In this paper, we examine the relationship between high-Density Lipoprotein cholesterol and risk of heart disease in men and women. The British Heart Study showed that a one-molg/dL increase in high D-cholestrol levels was associated with an increased risk for coronary heart diseases. However, other studies have shown no effect on these results. A double blinded trial found that bezafisibrate reduced the risk by reducing the amount of corn oil consumed in patients with atheroclerotic artery disease. This study also examined the effects of torcetrab on blood pressure, inflammation, and lipophospholipid concentrations in type 2 dialysis patients. Type 2 diabetes is particularly susceptible to cardiovascular disease because of its high susceptibility to arrhythmias. Although statin therapy has some drawbacks, it does reduce the severity of acute myocardialty or death from any cause. Another study suggests that combination therapy with simvastain may reduce elevated LDL-cholsteride levels as well as improve the level of low densitieslipoproprotein content in people with hypercholesteromemia. These studies suggest that treatment of such patients can lead to improved outcomes."
24918321,"In this paper, we describe a double blind, i.e. single-blind, placebo controlled trial of the efficaciousness of probiotic VSL#3, in the treatment for mild to moderately active ulceratic colitis. It was compared with placebo in terms of its ability to reduce disease activity and improve absorption of anti-inflammatory agents."
24814519,"In this study, the success of a split-mouth surgical procedure is compared with that of an identical protocol using blasted, acid-etched surfaces. The results are similar in terms of survival and success. After six weeks of healing, all implants are functionally loaded by cemented crown or fixed partial prostheses. A prospective case series study evaluates the short- term success rates of Titan screw-type implant with sland-etched surface after 3 months of loading. All patients receive five or six solid screw type titanium implants with large-griit, alchemized surfaces after three weeksof healing. At least one failed to integrate at first; however, several factors influence primary stability of dental implants during placement surgery. These include design, bone quality, implant jaw position, and the uses of ""a bone tap"". This report describes the Ankyles Implant Clinical Research group's evaluation of the influence of various factors on primary stableness and potential for an Antikylos implant that is cell-integrated and survives for at least three years of clinical functions."
25178118,"In this chapter, the authors discuss the use of ""comfortive end points"" in a large number of studies. They examine whether treatment with statmins can reduce major adverse events after acute chest disease. The results of these studies suggest that early statism may be more effective than conventional therapy for reducing long-term risk of heart failure. Acute coronary syndrome occurs when there is an elevated level of circulating C-Reactive Protein and/or other markers. These markers are associated with increased risk for sudden death or severe myomyocardial scarlet thrombolysis. This study also suggests that earlier statin therapy might improve survival in patients with chronically unstable angina. It is reported that it has been shown to reduce short-lived mortality in those with stable Angina Pectoris. However, recent studies have suggested that anti-inflammatory agents such as fluvastain should be used sooner after initial acute stroke because they lead to reduced levels of blood cholestrol. Furthermore, some studies indicate that even greater intensity of regimens may prevent premature death from atheotic events."
27717522,"The efficacy, tolerability, and safety of extended-reuse oxy butynin combined with the Alpha1 blockers tamsonosin as a treatment for lower Urinary tract symptoms. In this double- blinded trial, 420 patients aged 45 years old were divided into three groups: 1) men with lower bladder symptoms; 2) men who had benign prostatichypoplasia; and 3) men without upper urinary tract disease. A total International Protate Symptom Score was 13 or more; maximum urinarry flow rate 4 - 12ml/sec; two or More Urgency episodes per 24 hour after taking TTamsul Osculin. This study compares solifenacine plus alfuzosesin in Japanesemen with low Uriy Tract symptoms secondary to Benign prostase hyperplusa. These men are older than 50 years and receive either silodasin 0.2 mill once daily or soldenafil 0.5 mill twice daily. At four weeks and twelve weeks, the changes from base to end point were changed in international prostate symptom score, peak Ury Passage rate, residual urinevolume, sexual health inventory for males, IIEF function, overactive bladder spectral score -- all questions asked at the end"
24694271,"In this study, we examine the bone loss around a short stemmed cementless hip prosthesis in order to determine whether it can be used to preserve bone stock during revision surgery. The results show that there is no significant loss of bone at all after seven years of follow up. Aim This study uses dexametry to predict the changes in bone densiputation after total hiparthroplasty. It shows that patients with shorter stems have less pain and less complications than those with longer ones."
28887086,"In this study, we investigate the effects of Cinnamon on blood glucose, lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoforide in people with Type 2 diabetes. We conclude that it has potential to improve blood sugar levels in patients with type 2, especially when consumed at three different levels. Our results suggest that cinnamon might be able to help reduce blood glutathiasis and improve other blood-glucose concentrations in subjects with moderate to severe Type 1 disease."
29322626,"In this article, Anderson focuses on the use of the Hall technique to treat children's primary teeth. Although there is some evidence for the effectiveness of traditional restorative methods in treating caries in young children, little is known about their efficacy. The Fiction trial, a British charity funded by the HTA program, compares conventional and non-restorative approaches to treatment of primary tooth decay. This study evaluates the performance of two types of glass-immodified cements: one that uses fluoride as an indirect therapy and another that can be used as classificial restorations. It is shown that both materials perform well in patients with deep carious lesides."
30387072,"This study focuses on the effects of resistance training on older women's health. It is a random, controlled trial in which 24 elderly women were assigned into three groups: 1) control group; 2) periodized interval training; and 3) high- speed endurance training. The results show that both groups have significant improvements in physical function and quality of living. In this study, we examine the effect of two different types of exercise regimens on bone mineral density in older adults. We find that one type of exercises improves muscle cross sectional area, while the other does not. A further study investigates the efficability of an exercise intervention for older men with falls and fracture risk. Two studies have been performed to assess the safety and efficiacy of pyometric training methods on improving bone strength. One study has been published in the Journal of Strength Cond Remedy, where it was found that all three resistance train models produce significant improvement in several physical functions and health outcomes. Another study compares changes in bone mass in postmenstrual women who do not take daily or regular exercise."
27997978,"In this study, we compare the relative benefits and risk of resoline and guianethine in patients with mild-to moderate hypertension. The relative advantages and risks of each drug are determined biweekly. Major conclusions from the study were: 1) guanserpine will reduce mild or moderate blood pressure to normal; 2) in most cases side effects which do occur while taking either of these two drugs were well treated, and neither drug is clearly superior. Forty patient adults past age 60 who have mild to moderate diastolic bloodpressures of 160mmHg or less than 105mm Hg receive either a high dose of chlortalidone or an alternative treatment. Six hundred patients received either low dosage or high dosage of hydrochodothiazde daily. Fifty men suffering from Mild-To-Moderate Hypertension were studied in relation to comparison of the antihyptertensive efficacy by 'a combination of A beta blocker / sotalole hydrogen chloride 160mg/d. ) plus another thiarezide derivative hysteria Zide ;B-M? with that of... rser pine 0,1 Mg.

23514337,"This study focuses on the effects of lung rsections on exercise tolerance and FEV1-Vo2peak in patients who have undergone a major lungectomy. The results suggest that there are some predictors for postoperative exercise desaturation, but no association exists between these factors. A new method for measuring the quadriced muscles in seated position has been developed. It is used to measure the strength of the legs in men and women aged 61-80 years."
26512340,"The UMLIFT trial is designed to determine whether exercise training for older people can be more effective in relieving depression than low- intensity resistance training or general care by an elderly physician. In this study, we examine the effect of two physical activities on depressive severity over a five-year period among elders with chronic impairment and find that exercisers show significant improvement in symptoms of endurance and Gait. This study also finds that change in physical Self-Esteem predicts changes in depressed symptoms. A recent study has found that regular exercise may be beneficial in reducing mild to moderate Major Depressive disorder in older adults. However, studies have not yet examined the efficaciousness of exercise as an intervention strategy for improving balance, muscle strength, reaction time, physical function, health status, and prevents falling in community-living elderly people. These studies are limited because they do not include patients with severe fall risk factors. Although there is no difference in age-related falls, it is believed that walking and vigorous exercise are better at preventing them from falling."
24671713,"The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of etching and bonding with phosphatric acid and one bottle of self-etch. In eight teeth with cervical lesions, 8 patients received two types of restorations: 1) clearfil Linerbond II; 2) single bond; and 3) hybrid resin composite. After five months, the retention rate was 76.6 % in the composite and 87.3 %) in compomer. A new Restorative Material for Cervical Erosion/Abrasion Lesions has been introduced. This new restourative material uses a ""giomer composite"" that can be used as an impregnating material or alternatively as part of another type of restoration material. It compares the efficacy on three-step selfetched adhesives against conventional cements. At six months after initial placement, there are no significant discoloration attained. For this reason, it is recommended that dentists place only one set of replacements per tooth."
25324324,"This paper describes a patient-centered disease management program that improves the quality of care in patients with heart failing. It is based on Russian national guidelines, but it does not address the needs of low-resource patients. The aim of the study is to assess the impact of this program on blood pressure change in children and adults in varying regions in two different countries. Each region is assigned an intervention group which receives usual care or one which applies the cardiovascular risk control package. In the case of patients at mediumrisk of thrombosis, the treatment strategy is ""st and Ardized treatment algorithm"". Acute hypertension is the most common cause for death in the developing world."
24118784,"In this study, we investigate the effect that high-dose ascorbicacin improves endogenhelial function of Type 2 patients. We examine the effects of vit C on vasodinatory response to acute hyperemia in type 2 diabetic patients and compare it with those of other anti-diary agents. The results suggest that a long-term regimen of vitamin C may be beneficial for improving blood flow and vascular function in patients who have both Type1 and Type2 diabetes."
26708317,"In a parallel group study, 60 healthy volunteers were assigned to receive either 100 or 200mg modafinill. They did not show any change in their self-rations of sleepiness before the test session; however, they did show improvements in performance on several tests of response time and attention. Functional magnetic echography was used to detect regions of brain responses during changes in sensory stimulusi. The results suggest that methamphetantamines may improve cortical functions in patients with neuropsychic disorders. A recent study has shown that combined treatment with an antipsychotic can improve learning and memory in people with mental illness. This study also examines the effect of Modafranl on working memories. It is reported that it improves short-term memory tasks but does not affect long term memory function."
28110383,"This is a prospective, observational study of patients treated at Geneva University Hospital from January 2007 until February 12, 2012. All patients were admitted for an acute episode of uncomplicated diverticus and were compared with the results of two different treatment groups. One group received short-course antibiotics for up to five days; the other was given long-term IV arm between day 5 and 10 after which time it was decided whether or not to treat the patient. In this study, mesalidine was found to prevent recurring episodes of diverticululitis in patients who had previously experienced traumatic events. The efficacy resulted in preventing repeat attacks in 954 patients out of 105 patients."
16435593,"This paper describes a new approach to care for people with AIDS. It's not just about improving their health but also about making them more independent and less likely to fall from the wheelchair. The aim of this paper is to find out which services are most helpful to people who are infected or have gotten sick with an autoimmune disease. In addition, it will determine which parts of the program are best-suited to meet the needs of those who first get sick. For example, we found that occupational therapy was effective in relieving pain in patients with early relapses of rheuumaToid arthritis. We also found some cost-effectiveity results in this study. People with earlier arthritis were better off getting regular physical exercise than they were in the United states. Cost-efficacy analysis was followed by comparing costs and outcome on self-reporting measures using the Community dependentency Index. A pilot study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of two different approaches: one designed to assess independence and qualityof life while the other focused on cost efficacy. These studies examined how long subjects lived without falling after receiving treatment. They found no significant differences in performance or satisfaction at six months following intervention. However, there were still positive changes in patient' behavior afterward."
19533517,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective, cross-sectional study of some patients with severe spinal cord injury who complain of pain. We assess the severity of their pain and use an outcome measure to predict whether they will experience depression two years later. This is important because it can be difficult to know how long people will live after relapsed into pain due to their injury."
29637113,"In this study, the effects of Lactobacterium acidophilus on the risk of a neonate's death are investigated. The results suggest that Lacticillin reduces the severity of Necrotizing Enterocolitis in preterm babies. A double blind trial is performed to determine whether Lactopicillin and Bifdobactericia can prevent the onset of necrotating enterocotis in very- low birth weight premature infants. This trial was conducted from May 12, 2012 to April 13, 2013, with 112 subject r and Omized into 2 groups. It was aimed at comparing the effect of L. Casei or BfidObacterica on NEC stage 1 by the Bell score. Both groups showed significant reduction in the rate of Neccorising Enterolicotitis when compared to those who received no probiotic treatment."
23584278,"A laboratory study is performed to determine the effect of work speed on typing force, electromyografical activity, and subjective pain. The results indicate that as subjects type faster, their Type-Flexor and EMG activity increase linearly. There is also a rise in subjective discomfort with an increased threshold between self-selected pace and their Maximum Type Speed. This suggests that participants self select 'a Type pace that minimizes Type speed and minimized discomfort'. Young and older women perform different mouse tasks. Shoulder muscles are recorded from the deltoed muscle, right and Left upper trapeziuse muscle; and the neck exctensor Muscles were significantly higher in older people than young men. In this study, we examine whether motor dem and / visual dem influence muscle activity during work with mice. We find that females perform more mouse gain and target size when the mouse gains are small. Women perform multidirectional pointing tasks with the machine. All subjects demonstrate reduced working speed at the highest Mouse gain 1: 8 compared to those who have no such goal."
31049758,"In this paper, the authors describe a double blinded trial of pembrozumab as maintenance therapy for patients with lung cancer. The results are very good in terms of quality of life and overall survival. They conclude that erlotib is more efficacious than other agents in treating advanced non-squimous lung disease. This study compares three different regimens of new-genation combination chemotherapy to determine whether it prolongs survival or worsens performance. Affective events were noted by age group. These include: 1) an adverse event; 2) delayed response; and 3) increased risk of death from first-line treatments. After two years, these studies have been published. He also discusses the use of ""pembroliumabe"" as second line treatment for advanced small cell lung tumors."

The main outcome is to determine the percentage change in body- weight. A purposive samples of 15 intervention groups were recruited from smoke cessation class in areas of Multiple Deprivation; receiving dietary advise or control groups."" The primary outcome was to assess changes in health behavior over the six-month followup period. In this paper, we examine the long- term effects that Strong Healthy Women's intervention has on health-regarding behaviors, weight and Bm. Over the twelve- month follow-up interval, results showed significant pretest posttest changes as well as gains in weight gain for women who gave birth at the follow up period after the intervention. We conclude that strong healthy women can be used as a stand-alone intervention for pregnant women with high pregnancies. Although few studies have examined how to combine exercise and diet together to affect behavior changes, this study does not find any evidence of improving lifestyle change among older adults living in low-to-medium social economic status. It also finds no evidence regarding the effectiveness of an actor-played motivational counseling tool for universal prevention purposes. There are many other studies which have looked into the effect of multiple behavior change but none of them have been able to identify the most effective one."
20416377,"Aims to examine the prevalence of non-medicative use of prescribed stimulants among US colleges in terms of students and college characteristics. The authors hypothesize that modafinill will improve shiftwork sleep disorder by reducing the release of glutamic neurotransmitters, which may lead to improved symptomatic response and hormonal responses during hypoglyccaemia. In this double blinded, within participant trial, 11 healthy men received either an immediate-repearance methylphenis date or placebo on two days before performing a wide range of tasks designed to assess memory, planning, verbalfluency, and sustained attention. This study investigates the effects of armodofinil on alertness in young adults undergoing sleep deprivement. It is found that the drug reduces wakefulness but does not affect performance on other measures of mental function."

They conclude that the new devices will lead to improved knee function and improved quality of life."
27882320,"Artichoka leaf extracts reduce plasma lipoproteins levels, including totalcholesterol. The British Heart Study reported that much of this relation to high-denity lipophosphoprotein cholesterol was eliminated bycovariance adjustment. In the Framington Heart study, only the controls were examined. A 1-g/dL increase in high density Lipoproprotein Cholinesterol was associated with an increased risk of coronarry heart disease. This association was not confirmed in the Lipid Research clinics Prevalency Mortality follow-up study and Coronary primary prevention trial. However, there was no significant change in HDLC after 8 months. These studies are important because they provide evidence for the effect of fish oil on cardiovascular disease in Indians. They also show that coconut oil has antioxidative effects on lipodysms but do not affect body composition."

28718394,"In this study, a double blinded, placebo-control trial of sertriline in patients with coexisting major depression is compared to that of an earlier, more well-to-do trial. The results suggest that sertraline may be superior to placebo in treating patients who have significant depressive symptoms. Vilazodene, the most promising antidepressedant currently on the market, is shown to be as effective as either regimen in terms of improving patient's mood and behavior. A further study suggests that paroxetine might be able to reduce the risk of adverse side effects from chemotherapy in elderly patients suffering from somatic disorder and senility."

In this study, we examine the association between blood levels of C-Reactive Protein and risk for death, myocardiaal infarctions, and acute stroke in subjects with a subsequent end point. We conclude that CRP is associated with higher risk than those who do not have an event. A diet high in lean beef reduces LDL cholesterol but does not improve blood pressure. This study also investigates the effect of fiber on blood flow and inflammation. It was found that consuming more fiber may lower blood vessels and thus increase the risk of heart disease."
27530471,"In this paper, we describe a study of patients with Type 2, Diabetes Mellitus. We aim to evaluate the effect of Oral Magnesum on Insulin Sensibility and Secretion in Type 2 Diabetes. The results are quite similar. After 3 months, there is no significant difference in blood pressure or lipid levels between the two treatment groups. Aim This study investigates the efficaciousness of oral magnesium for the reduction of fasting blood-glucosine levels in people with prediabtes and hypo magnesemia. It was found that either solution improved glucose control in subjects with new diagnoses of pridiabetes or hypomagnesium. Furthermore, it showed that Mg could be used as an anti-diaritory agent in type 2 diabetes."

In the first group, the patients were assigned to receive either high-monounced fatty acid or high carbohydrate diet for one year; in the second and third groups, they were given different amounts of food. The results showed that the control group had greater weight loss and improved blood glucose levels than the other treatment groups. This study also examined the effects of changing the amount of carbohydrates in people with Type 2 Diabetes. It was found that eating more fat could reduce the severity of the disease but that this intervention did not prevent it from developing."
25855678,"In this chapter, we discuss the benefits of beta blockers on long term outcome after acutemyocardial rctic infa-rck ion. We also examine the effects of antigtensinconverting enzymes on left ventricular function. The beneficial effect of these drugs on short-term outcome was shown before theintroduction of thrombrolysis and Angiotensol-converting Enzyme inhibitors. This trial included 17 994 patients who had proven left atrial dysfunction during the first day of the trial. After six weeks and seven months, 1749 were assigned to receive either amlopril or placebo added as conventional therapy for hisochondria. A subset of 1654 patients showed severe heart failure from a nonicemia cardiomyopathy. Amlostin reduces the risks of death among patients with myocholeration due to ""nineischemic"" Cardiomyopathies; however, there were only 278 deaths per group. Atrium fibrillation occurs frequently in people with heart failing. Some studies suggest that blocking the Renin-Antonin AldosterOne system may prevent it."

Medical treatment is performed by one doctor who is blinded from the treatment modality. In this study, all patients were treated twice weekly with dead sea salt heated to 35 degree C for 20 minutes. All treatments were evaluated by an assessor both before and after treatment. This study was doubleblind but of two weeks duration. It was followed that all patient's serum levels were measured at random intervals until they reached their desired values. Balneedleotherapy was studied in patients without gonarthroses as well as those with severe psoliasis. Both groups showed improvement in pain scores and tenderness. They also showed improvements in physical health and quality of life. Most systematic reviews rely upon the assessment of method logical quality"
22331380,"The effect of the 0- and 7.5-gram-dozen-day-old men on blood pressure, lipids, and lipoproteins were studied in 10 Type 2 patients. The effects of consuming either a high-flora or low-content diet on these subjects were not observed. In contrast, the control diet was associated with higher blood concentrations and greater free fatty acids. A further study was performed to examine the effect that consumption of fructoses had on heart rate, blood sugar, insulin sensitivity, fat homeostasis, as well as other risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes."
24897375,"Clostridial difficile is a disease that causes considerable morbidity, and there are many new treatments to treat it. In this paper, we describe the use of real-time polymerase chains reaction for the detection or prediction of Cdi toxinA and B genes. The results of this study suggest that treatment with monoclonic antibodies may be more effective in treating patients with severe infection. A prospective cohort study was conducted at an academic hospital from January through April 1995. All patients were treated with acute symptoms during four months of an epidemic. This study attempted to determine the extent of disease severity ranged from mild Diarrhyea to fullminant Colitis. We examined the proportion of subjects in each category who had recurrent infections after receiving either metirondazole nor vancomycin. These patients received fidaXomicin 200mg twice daily or van comycin 125mct four times daily as treatment. At the end of the chapter, our aim was to assess the effect of age on the outcome of cure, resolution of diarrhea, no further complications, or death within two weeks of complete treatment"
24549404,"Fernandez de las-Poeas C.,Alonso-Brunco C and Morales CabezasMiangolarra Page JC Two exercise interventions for the treatment of patients with anklelosing pondylitis. A rand and ommized controlled trial was performed to evaluate the effects of an eight-week comprehensive protocol of strength and flexibility exercises on joints mobility, functional capacity, pain, and depression after patients were assigned to either a wait list control group or an exercise therapy group. After eight weeks, they showed improvements in knee flexion, shoulder flexation, abduction, hip absorption, chest expansion, vital capacity as well as diseases activity. The aim of these studies was to compare results of conventional exercise, swimming, walking, bathing, disease activity, quality of living, health assessment questionnaires and psychological measures in patients who had ankylosizing spondiness. This study is based on ninetiful controls over fifty-five patients from New York's medical college. In this study, we examine the effect of two different types of exercise on pain: 1) aerobic exercise; 2) self-relief; and3) home-based physical therapy. We conclude that there are no significant differences in pain between the two groups."
25510863,"In this paper, Dr. Bhaer systematically reviews the evidence on the efficaciousness of various forms of physical exercise and stress reduction for patients with acute coronary heart diseases. He concludes that there is growing evidence in the literature that yoga may be an effective treatment for Type 2 diabetes melanitus but that more research is needed to fully assess its effcacy."
29169245,"This study aims to determine whether motivational interviewers can improve physical activity, selfefficacy, outcome expectations and exercise behavior in older women after hip fracture. In this paper, we describe the results of a single-blind, rand-omized control trial with 30 adults who have been treated for their hip injury. The participants were divided into four groups: exercise plus, exercise only, plus only or routine care. After two, six and 12 months, patients were compared at different levels of recovery. They were measured by accelerometers on wrists and waists. Acutely, they showed signs of improvement in all eight areas of function. Post-surgeries, however, revealed that there was no difference in time or length of upright movements between men and women who did not walk outdoors. These studies are included in the Trondhe hip fracture trial as part of the controlled trial. All patients received usual care during the first three years of follow-up. There was an association between walking and health outcomes. Sedential behavior was also associated with disease. An international registry of systematic reviews was established following publication of PRISMA's statement ""Prosero"" which described the process of submission of reviews across all areas from all aroundthe world."
15846636,"In this study, we examine the effect of a combination of psychological and physical treatment on patients with uneexplained symptoms in comparison to medical care. We compare the effects of six- and 16-sessions of Cognitive-Behavioral or Psychodynamic-Interpersonal psychotherapy for depressed patients who have ""medically unexplainable physical symptoms."" The results suggest that these treatments are more effective than conventional medical treatment. Brain Snack: Beck's Depression Inventory is an instrument used to predict severity of depression. It also measures how quickly the patient responds to different types of therapy. For example, CB seems to be more rapid than PI when it comes to depression; however, there is no evidence that either method does any better than the other. This study furthermore investigates the use of brief psychological intervention in patients suffering from chronic irritablebowel syndrome. Acute bowel disease is one of the most common complaints in primary care, yet often uneXplainably undiagnosed. There is little evidence regarding the effectiveness of short-term psychological treatment in treating such patients."
30371517,"This is a prospective, cross-sectional study of patients with chronic low backpain who received multiple treatment approaches. The outcome measures were self-reported health status, pain- related disability, average pain intensity, depressed feelings, days in painful, hours at pain, prescription and noprescription medication use, and work satisfaction. In this paper, we describe the courseof disability and identify prognosic factors of lowback pain in patients receiving multidisciplinary treatment. We assess the performance of somatic tests for prediction of the efficacy of multidiscretionary treatment in subjects with suba acute low Back Pain. A total of 175 patients from whom to receive treatment were evaluated for his or her condition at pretreatment and at 2-, 5-, 12 month follow-up. Somatic values were assessed with 3 physical performance tests: Villiger T, OeSCH test, Biering Srenson test. These results were then used as predicters of function after an intense intervention into these patients."
30667278,"The Heart exercise and remote technologies study is a novel approach to improving physical activity in people with Ischaemic Heart Disease. It involves delivering telephony messages, which are delivered over ten days on the same device as usual care. All participants are able to attend regular community-based heart rehabilitation. This study also examines the effectiveness of an extended lifestyle intervention for patients with acute chest disease. In this case, it is used to reduce risk factor levels by using standardized risk factors that are calculated at one year's follow-up time. Acute chest diseases are particularly difficult to treat because they involve frequent visits to the emergency department. However, there is little evidence of improved outcomes after long-term treatment."
31152444,"A British Association for Physicians has published a third version of its treatment guide for bipolar patients. The first version was based on evidence from the literature, while the second version focused on more detailed reviews of the available evidence. In this paper, the authors present an assessment of whether pretreatment characteristics such as mixed affective states might predict relapse to the two different drugs. Twenty-sensing patients meeting DPM-IV criteria were assigned to either chlorpromazin or lithium Carbonate for three weeks. After comparing the effects of these two drugs, nine of fourteen patients treated with both drugs had response favorably; 12 of 13 patientized with chlorpropanine had responded favoribly. Two other drug trials in manic patients are reported. Nineteen newly admitted menic subjects were treated for 1 month r and Omly assigned by doubleblind basis, with ChlorPromazine or Lithium Carbone. Both treatments produced significant changes in the severity of their symptoms but did not lead to any severe side effects. This study compares the efficaciousness and safety of quetispine monothérapie vs placebo for the management of acute psychiatric disease. It is shown that queitiarepin does not produce much sedation but produces considerable improvement of behavior-motion activity. For the long term, however, it is unclear which regimen will be most effective because no single drug can be sufficient in daily practice for all patients"
20189946,"In this study, we examine the effect of single chamber atrium pacing on patients with sicksinus disease. After a mean interval of 3.3 months, atrial pacering was associated with less attrioventricular fibrillation than either group. We conclude that there is no difference in mortality or heart failure between these two groups. The follow-up visits are for three months and 12 months then again once per year. All patients have an ECG recording, resting electrograms, and pacemakers. End points are mortality, cardiovascular death, Atrial fibrilation, thrombolic events, Heart failure ; and /or if they have had previous statin treatments. Two hundred patients undergo elective cardinal surgery without prior treatment to be treated with atorvastamin 40mg/d. This trial confirms that atorsvastatin prevents paroxysal atarrhythmies after cardiac surgery. Acute high rate episodes are detected by pace maker diagnostics but do not lead to serious complications. Another study compares dual chamber versus singlechamber paced therapy in patients suffering from sinus node disorder. These results suggest that it is difficult to predict which type of device will result in the best outcome."
25803266,"Sweet Talk is a new type of self-management system designed to improve Type 1 diabetes in patients with chronic disease. It uses text messages from the sweettalk app to help patients set goals and track their progress over time. The results show that blood pressure control is improved when patients receive short message service or telephone follow up. In this trial, we compare the efficacy for nurse's followup via cell phones and phone devices on asthma control. We also examine the acceptability of using short messenger services to ensure patientadherence to management regimens. This study evaluates the effectiveness of physician led remote telemedicical management as compared to usual care in heart failure patients. A novel intervention design was developed to support patients during visits between clinic visits by sending short messages sent to an ""iPhone Short Messaging"" application. These messages are tailored specifically to each patient' profile and include topical "" newsletters,"" and anonymous tips from other patients."" Blood glucose levels are maintained within the normal range after six months of treatment. Diabetes mellituseism is common in low- income populations but has not been studied extensively. Some studies have suggested that cell phone technology may be useful in improving medication adherence among poor-educated patients who frequently miss their medicine."
12695268,"In this study, we assess the efficiacy and safety for amiomedarone in the treatmentof patients with recurring atrial fibrilation. A prospective, double blind, omismatched trial is conducted to assess whether a single dose of aviodaron can be used as an effective regimen for maintaining sinus rhythm in acutely ill patients. The results are mixed: some patients have reversions to normal sinus pattern after several hours of treatment; others have no such effect."
24018611,"In this paper, we describe the results of a pilot study with 600 patients who are members of health maintenance organizations. We assess the effect on cost savings amongst patients with famiably ill. The patients receive either an operant behavior therapy or CBT for sleep disturbances and improvement in their functional status. They also report significant improvements in pain intensity after treatment. This is followed by another study that examines whether psychiatric intervention is as effective as usual care for improved function in patients suffering from fibromyalsgiA. A recent meta analysis concludes that multiplecomponent treatments can be effective for some symptoms of fever-like sensitivity. However, there has been no evidence of any real change in patient's pain at followup."
27788565,"In this study, the authors examine the effect of infants receiving a daily dose of fish oil rich in docotsaheXaenoici acid on growth and body quality. They compare the effects of feeding pre-term babies with breast milk or formula that contains only long chain polynsaturated fats. The results suggest that early maternal consumption of DHA may improve brain development. A double blinded trial is performed to determine whether an infant's diet with either high-Dha or low-DAA content will improve mental development at birth. Both groups receive similar levels of blood phospholipins; however, both groups have significantly different concentrations of these lipids during their first months of life."
19398930,"The aim of this paper is to determine the cause of symptoms after rebuffing with a bandage. In this study, we examine the effect of probiotics on patients suffering from diarrhea caused by previous bouts of pelvic surgery. We compare the efficaciousness of antibiotic Lactobacilus casei-DN-114001 in comparison to control placebo in patients treated with mild to moderate malignancies. This was based on an observational double blinded trial and showed that Antibiophillus patient showed superiority in terms of number of stool movements and consistency over placebo."
28455363,"This paper describes a prospective cohort study of nine female division 1 college team players with post-conscussion Syndrome who have recovered quickly after concusession. The results indicate that the severity of the injury is similar to that of other patients, suggesting that some patients may have reduced exercise ability in order to reflect altered central nervous system control. In this study, we investigate the incidence of conjussessions and subsequent injury risks among professional rugby players. A subspecion of 19 patients has been studied using blood oxygen-level dependent magnetic resonance imaging. We conclude that mild trauma brain injuries are one of many public health concerns, and remain an important public concern. However, there is no reliable way to diagnose or predict recovery from such injuries."
26508743,"This is a small, well-controlled study of the effects of an omogenized low-fat dairy diet on patients with severe rheumaloid arthritis. Sixty six patients were assigned to either one of two preference conditions: yes or no; they were randomly assigned from 1 of 2 diets. The results of this study suggest that if you are looking for weight loss, eat fewer refined foods and less animal fat. In general, vegetarians do have lower blood pressure and lipoprotein concentrations than  Omnivores can. Aiming To compare the effect of calorie restricted, high-fated, low/fat lactovovegetary diet in comparison with conventional diabetic regimens, we studied subjects with Type II diabetes. Both diet groups were divided into two groups: the experimental group was assigned first to 'preference-yes' while the control group went to ""prefer-no"". After 24 weeks, the experiment group received 13% of their usual food at each meal. They also had significantly greater reductions in both total cholesterol and LDLcholesterol but did not show any change in other markers of disease severity."
27019254,"This is a small, well-controlled study designed to determine the effects of Cr-enriched wheat on blood glucose, insulin, and other markers of oxative stress in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The results are quite different from those obtained by placebo. In this study, thirty-six men and women were divided into three groups: one group was given 400 g Cr as Cr enriched yeast; another group received placebo for 12 weeks. These results show that Cr rich yeast has pronounced increases in fasting bloodglucosine compared to either group. A further study was performed to investigate the efficacy of chlormium treatment alone or in combination with other nutrient agents in type 2 diaries. It was found that chromium did not improve control of these patients. However, it was reported that it could be used as an adjournant to prevent disease."
25350225,"The safety and long-term effects of the selective Alpha 1A adrenoneceptor antagonist, tam'sin, on patients with lower Ury Trch symptoms are investigated in this study.

19221376,"This study focuses on the cost-efficacy of pravastin in patients with acute myomyocardial heart disease. It is based on an actual clinical, cost effectiveness analysis and health- related quality-of- life results from the Care trial. In sub-group analysis, it is more favorable for older patients who have pretreatment low density Lipoprotein levels greater than 125mg/dl. A model was used to calculate lifetime risks of events and costs associated with treatment and hospital visits in the United kingdom. The Beaverdam Heart Outcome Study is an ongoing cohort study of human health status and well-being. Women are included in this study because of their lower risk of sudden death as a result of age. Although there are few studies regarding sudden cardiac death in women, recent evidence suggests that they may be attributable to differences in risk factor. These factors include elevated serum cholesterol, which increases the risk but does not increase the overall risk. Furthermore, high blood-cholesterol levels can lead to increased risk or severity of coronary diseases."
30071588,"In this paper, Dr. Manette focuses on the use of ""irrational"" or ""virtual reality"" as an aid in the treatment of people with brain injuries. He uses a novel surgical device called Leap motion to demonstrate how it can be used to treat patients who have been traumatically injured by head trauma. The main aim of the present trial is to evaluate the efficacy of using virtual reality on self confidence and knowledge of surgeons. This study was published in two articles: one about posttraumatic brain injury and another about treating children with autism. Anxious children are common with ASD, but they often have specific fears and fear that can lead to serious consequences for their families. We developed 'a unique treatment' combining CBT and graduated exposure in Vre'. Nine boys with severe anxiety were recruited. Each had anxieties around crowded busses or stimulus. Parkinson's disease is characterized by neurodegenerative changes among other conditions. Posture problems have serious consequence for patients, not only limited their daily life; also increasing some risk of fall. There is scarcity of good quality improvement initiatives targeted patient satisfaction. These studies focus on preoperative experiences which will improve patient-report outcomes for surgical procedures."
20927745,"The Early Intervention Trial is a double blinded, placebo controlled trial of 200 patients with mild symptoms. In this study, the results of treatment are shown to be well-controlled. Prostatevolume and urinary symptoms decline significantly in both groups. A group consisting of 105 men with bladderoutflow obstruction dueto benign prostatichyplusa was treated in an doubleblind / placebo-control study with finosteride 5mg or 10 mg per day or placebo for three months. After 1year, they reduced their symptom score by 14 p.m. and increased their flow rate. This study also shows that finasteide improves Urinary Score scores as well as changes in prostate volume. It has been reported that fist-reductal inhibitors have some beneficial effects on prostrate tissue but not on overall health. Men with benign hyperplasa were studied in two previous studies. Two trials showed that different types of drugs could lead to different efficacy in different age groups; however, these trials did not show any significant differences in patient response to either treatment."
23790149,"The effects of high-protein diets on weight loss, blood lipid levels, and Type 2 diabetes are investigated in this study. In the first two studies, we found that high fat diet was associated with increased insulin resistance and risk of type 2, while high fiber diet had no effect on these outcomes. This study also showed that long-term weight gain and loss were associated by increasing the risk for type 2 disease in overweight adults. A comparison of Mediterranean-inspired low-fat or conventionally-style diet regimens was made. Two trials were performed: one designed to test whether a Meddiet style diet could reduce the rate at which patients develop heart disease; another intended to assess whether an alternative Mediterranean lifestyle could be more effective in preventing strokes and heart failure. These studies examined the efficacy as well as the relative safety of different Mediterranean approaches. We concluded that the Mediterranean approach was superior to the control group in terms of improving endotility in subjects with mild-moderated dementia."
20099019,"In this paper, we describe a doubleblind, randomed, parallel- group, placebo-control trial of homeopathic treatment for fibromyalsgia. We assess the effect of usual care on patients with fms who are not well treated by conventional medicine. The main outcome measure is the difference in FIQ score after three months of treatment. This study concludes that ""A + B"" and ""Omized"" clinical trials of classical homeopathy are likely to produce false positive results because they involve certain design features. However, studies using these features have shown that there is no real difference between pain and health at any time. A further study examines changes in brain functions during treatment of unipolar depressed patients. These include EEG relative and relative power, cordance, and change from baseline and after 48h and one week on drug nor placebo."
26122377,"In this paper, the authors describe a split-mouth treatment that involves two treatments placed on either side of the tooth. The split mouth design removes much of an interindividual variability in the results of each treatment. They compare the clinical performances of packable or conventional resin composites for class I restorations over three years. A selfetching and selfpriming system is used to prevent post-oppressive sensitivity; however, it does not improve the patient's comfort. This study also examines the effect of different types of dentin bonds on the performance of posterior filler-to-posterior materials. It shows that there is no difference in wear resistance between the two types but only four independent variables show significant predictive relationships among the independent factors. Flawful designs, conduct, analysis, and reports of rand and ommized trials can lead to the effects of intervention to be underestimated or overestived."
28490031,"In this double blinded, multi-centre study, we compare the efficaciousness of bupropion and ven lafaxine in treating major depression. The changes in sexual function are similar for both groups; however, they differ significantly on the 17 item Hamilton Depression Rating scale. Venlafine is superior to buproppion in terms of improving symptoms but also has a greater effect on insomnia. A sensitivity analysis indicates that brofaromin is more effective than placebo in patients who suffer from Major Depressive disorder. This paper reviews several studies which have examined the effectiveness of antidepressedants as well as their effects on depressed patients. These studies include two large prospective trials with over 3,500 patients: one where overall depression levels decline, and another where there is no change in severity. We conclude that the improvement on any single measure of depression can be transformed into three different clinical categories: minor, mild, moderate/severe, or major."
23554153,"This study focuses on the effects of knee pain on gait and muscle activity in patients with knee Ostearthritis. The aim of this study is to investigate lower leg movement and muscles during walking in healthy subjects without knee disease. A pilot version of the commonly used Neck-Aid Fittest was first developed, followed by a second version that uses different rater versions to assess both rand and ommized studies. In this paper, the effect of height or weight on hip, knee, and ankle joints is examined. Gait results are compared between subjects with normal knee condition and subjects who have knee osteoarthoris as well as controls."
26098509,"In this study, we examine the effects of a daily routine of watching and playing video games on energy balance in healthy young adults. The results suggest that these activities may be beneficial for improving health. We conclude that there is little known about the effect of these physical activities on appetite and energy expenditure. This paper uses observational longitudinal methods to assess the influence of activity on body mass and weight. It was found that children who consumed sugar-sweetened drinks were more likely to be overweight than those who did not. A pilot version of the validated ""Face and content validity"" framework was developed and used to test the reliability of its features."
29733052,"Back pain is a common cause of work-related disability and many studies have investigated the efficacy of various forms of intervention to improve patients' return to work. This paper presents i) comparing the effects of an intervention on sickleeism with that of standardized case management, and b) using population-based, rand-omized control trials to assess the effect of different approaches on returning to health."
29767225,"This paper describes a novel balance training program that improves balance in older people. It is shown that the program results in improvements in postural control, gait Speed, balance performance, and fall risk factors. In this study, patients with an acute fracture who had not undergone surgery were compared to those who received no intervention. The primary objective was to evaluate changes in health-related qualities of life after hip fracture. After two weeks of exercise, subjects were assigned to one of three treatment groups: 1) single task balancetraining; 2) dual task training under fixedpriority instruction set; and 3) double task trained under variable Priority Instruction set. Although there were significant gains in the exercise group, the outcome did not differ significantly from their control peers."
28042114,"In this paper, the first two senior authors independently begin using an identical improved posterior soft tissue repairs after total hip surgery through a postero-lateral approach. The second author's experience is highly significant. This study compares the results of primary total knee arthroscopic revisions with those of fixed and ardy fractures. Aiming to determine whether or not the use of larger heads prevents dislocation in patients who have been treated for recurrent instability, we performed 61 revision procedures. At 7.5 years follow-up, no instability occurred. However, there was evidence that such devices were associated with lower rates of dislocation than conventional metal cups. Displaced breaks of the neck can be treated with either single-arm cup or double-mobility Cup. These devices are more cost-effective than traditional methods because they do not involve excessively long post-surgery care."
16606807,"In this doubleblind, multi-center, placebo-control study, Dofetilde was found to be effective in converting patients with atrium fibrillation into sinus rhythm. The results suggest that flecainiide and quinicidine are equally efficacious in the prevention or maintenance of normal Sinrhythms in patients who have recurrent symptoms. A prospective, single- blind trial is performed to compare the safetyand efficiacy of flecasinide as well as quinine when used for treatment of patients suffering from symptomatic Atrial Fillation. This study concludes that propaftenone seems to reduce the frequency of arrhythmical occurrences after direct current heartbeat. It also suggests that sothalol may be more effective because of its strong class III antiarctic action. Another study investigates the effectiveness of metopropolyl on the reducing of atrial fibrillations in persistent atary fibrilation; it has been reported that such agents can lead to sudden death."
30945127,"This paper uses a novel method to map the European Quality-of- Life Questionnaire into an American quality of life scale, the Dermatological Life Quality Index. The results are compared with predicted health utility values from other measures, such as the Barthela Index and the Physician's Quality of Life Measure. In addition, this paper discusses methods for calculating health state utility using multiple disease-specific measure scores. It also describes two different types of instruments used in medical practice: the Paetric Quality Of Life Survey, which has been widely used for measuring health related qualities of living; and another instrument called the Child Health Utility Index -- which is not preferred for cost-efficacy -- but rather preferential because it can be calculated directly from patients' responses. These studies aim to improve the ability of physicians to predict health-related features from patient-recorded surveys. Although many studies have attempted to derive utility weights from disease specific questions, few have tried to do so. For example, one approach involves comparing the Fact-G score to the Euro-Quol 5-Doctor-Dimention-3L utility index in breast cancer. A second approach employs multivariate logistic regression to estimate utility value from individual patient samples. Finally, we present sensitivity analysis of the performance of several different approaches on the EQ-Five-Domain Score."
11034761,"In this study, we investigate the effect of IVK-II on newborn infants. The results indicate that VKD is more effective in preventing bleeding than either alone or by prophylactic treatment. We conclude that it is possible to prevent premature birth and death by administering adequate amounts of vitamin K directly at birth."
30293909,"In this study, we examine the effect of daily doses of a high-dose Vitamin D on bone mineral denity in patients with severe heart failure. The results suggest that daily dosages may be more effective than conventional methods for improving bone health. We conclude that these studies are inconsistent and contradictory. A double blind placebo controlled trial is conducted in Australia to determine whether an intervention delivered through meal-on-wheels can reduce falls in older adults who have low levels of 25HVD. This trial was performed in June 2010, December 1, 2009, May 31, 2010; and the last visit was completed in October 10, 2011. Although current evidence suggests that vitamin D might prevent fractures in elderly people, there is little concluding evidence regarding its efficacy or safety. For example, several studies indicate that increased blood concentrations increase bone turnover but no effect on fracture risk. These studies also show that higher levels do not improve bone quality. However, they provide some additional information about the effects of other measures of bone strength such as muscle mass and bone loss."
31021537,"In this study, we describe a long term safety and efficacity of the interleuvinin-6 receptor-inhibiting tociliumab for treatment of patients who have active juvenile idicated arthritis. We conclude that it is safe and effective in treating children with polyarthritis-regarding arthritis as well as those with severe disease activity. A prospective open-labeled trial was performed on 300 patients aged 12-18 years with moderately severe oligoarchar disease. The results were published in September of 2013. Children with chronic pain or stiffness were treated with Etanertic 0.8mg/kg once every week. This study also describes an eight-week physical conditioning program designed to improve health-related qualities of life in children suffering from juvenile ""idiopathies"" such as erythema, psoratic arthritis, or ostechoic diseases. To assess the effects of weight bearing exercises on disease symptoms and severity in childhood with adult Polyarticular Juvenile Ostebrial Arthritas. Both treatments are shown to result in improvement in joint swelling and pain at least 50 percent. Although there is no concluding evidence for their efficacy, these studies suggest that they should be used as reference when assessing patient response to treatment."
31334564,"This study focuses on the effects that rest breaks and short-term stretching exercises have on workers' symptoms. The results of this study indicate that there is no significant difference in pain between patients who are working with long periods of repetitive tasks and those who do not work at all. In addition, studies suggest that exercise breaks can improve performance by improving neck and shoulder pain. A new worksite preventive program has been developed to promote healthy working lives for construction workers. Thirteen departments from five construction companies participate in this cluster-rand-omizedcontrolled trial. Eight departments were assigned to an intervention groups and 7 departments was assigned control groups. These included physical therapists, rest break tools, and empowerment training sessions. They also collected information on work engagement, social support, physical fatigue, need for recovery, etc."
28027041,"In this study, we examine the effects of written emotional disclosure on patients with a chronic pain-symptuary disease. We conclude that written emotion disclosure is an effective treatment for people with symptoms of fagital pain. This paper also describes how to use functional interactivity to improve health outcomes in patients who are suffering from mutilated fibromyalsgia. The authors present evidence that physical exercise can be used to treat musculoliskeletal pain and suggest that it may help to reduce pain severity."
29546180,"This study aims to assess the efficability of a healthy lifestyle intervention, ""Sport for Life,"" for increasing physical exercise, decreasing sitting time, and encouraging healthier attitudes and behavior to nutrition. In this paper, we examine the effects of the six-week program on children's total seated time; in particular, our aim is to investigate whether the program has an effect on improving physical activity at all levels. We conclude that the intervention improves both physically and mentally in children from low socioeconomic background. The first aim of these studies is examined by comparing the two groups of children who improved in their physical activities with those who did not. A further aim was to compare the differences between the three groups as they relate to age, gender, ethnicity, living status, having siblings. These results are compared among five different schools in Belgium. Children wear accelerometers during seven days at baseline and follow up. There is little evidence about how effective sedentaries can be when they involve long periods of sitting. Therefore, this study uses the active for life approach to evaluate the benefits of walking, sitting, standing, eating, sleeping, snacking, etc. It shows that it reduces siting time while improving health in general."

It uses a cross-sectional survey of African Americans to examine whether perceived discrimination is related to allostatic loading, as well as to other risk factors. The results suggest that social support may be associated with different levels of biological risks across multiple major systems. Furthermore, this study investigates the relationship between perception of ""racial distinction"" and medication fidelity among black patients with hypertension."
28393328,"In this study, we examine the effect of physical activity on bone mineral density in older adults. We find that exercise training consists of vigorous intensity and moderate intensity will improve insulin sensitivity in overweight subjects. However, there is no established method for predicting the effects of these intensities on patients with Type 2 diabetes. This study uses a mixed-race sample of healthy young men and women to assess the association between physical activities and depression. The results suggest that mildly intense exercise may be associated with improved blood glucose control in elderly people."
28752873,"In this study, we examine the effects on blood lipids of Indian subjects by replacing groundnut oil with sunflower or canola oil. The results indicate that high lin-leic acid and alpha-Linoleric acid reduce the risk of coronaries heart disease in men and women. We also investigate the effect of long- chain PUFA such as palm oil and coconut oil on cardiovascular disease. Long-chain fatty acids are associated with reduced risks of atherocity but have been found to be beneficial in humans. A double-blinded, parallel-gavage study is conducted in 150 healthy subjects age 25-72 years old. Thirteen young and normal weight individuals were overfated muffins high from either fat rich in Alpha LinOlenic acid or coconut Oil. After 12 weeks, they were assigned to either one of three treatment groups: frozen  Yohurt with 20, soya beans Lecithin Or Frozen Yogurt With 17 G Sunflower Oil For Another 4 Weeks. Blood samples and dietary habits were measured beforerun-in and before andafter intervention. Public health strategies for lowering the severity of certain diseases involve reducing ""stained fat"" content rather than increasing total energy. However, there is little information about the best type of fat to replace it on these risk factors."
31583381,"Age-related changes in muscle strength are associated with reduced age-specific peak torque, which is a measure of how fast and slow an extensator can move. Women show greater increases in the stretch shortening cycle than men. Insulin resistation is one of Polycysic Ovarian Syndrome's most common features. The aim of this study is to determine whether vitamin D deficientiency will lower blood glucose levels and insulin resistance among women with polycrystic oomy syndrome. A double blinded trial was performed with 50 women aged 20 to 40 who had been assigned to receive three oral treatments consistting of 50,000 Iu of vitaminD or precise placebo 1 every 20days for 2 months. Muscle Mass decreases with time leading to ""sarcopenisa"" or low relative mass in elderly people. Although there has been no studies on the effect of meat consumption on older people, it is believed that it may improve skeletal muscles. This study examined whether adding ricota cheese daily could improve whole body composition and skeleton muscle size in old men over 60 years"

It will assess whether there is an incentive to hire mothers who search for employment and remain employed after they are hired. In addition, it will determine whether women can find work early in their lives. The aim here is to improve the quality of care provided in the country by using subsidy from the government as a means to encourage mothers to seek employment once they have found one. Aims To better understot and the marketplace for childrearing in Riyada--both the supply and Dem and sides --and to design r and Omized controlled experiments to test whetheraccess to inexpensive day care could incentiviize Arab mothers that search actively for jobs and stay employed once she is hired."""
18457601,"Preparation for pregnancy is important, but many women do not know about the association of folate with neural tube defects. This paper focuses on two strategies: 1) population health promotion in Australia to encourage pregnant women to take more folicacin; and 2) public awareness of the benefits of taking a daily dose of ferociously-dosed floracid. The first strategy was to assess whether women knew that there was an association between folic acid and nerve defect. In this study, we examine the relationship between maternal demographic and behavior characteristics with these measures. We conclude that most women are aware of ""the correct message"" when it comes to their diets before pregnancy. Women who have been informed of this information are less likely to be concerned about their pregancy than those who were unaware of its importance. A second strategy involves assessing the knowledge and attitude of pregnant females regarding periconsceptional  Folc acid. Two studies examined the effect of earlier consumer-direct information campaign on improving knowledge of prophylaxes for the preventive effects of neural tub defects among women aged 15 and 44 year old. These studies found that prior to the intervention, only 3.8 %) of women had taken or recommended fulcaxis from physicians. Another study investigated the influence of early childhood education on knowledge concerning folac acid during pregnancy as well as the impact of physician intervention on women's use of regiments of both erythrocyte and blood tests."
32337708,"A doubleblind, rand and Omized study is designed to determine whether the use of prophylactically-dosed vitamin C would reduce the risk of common colds in marine recruits. The results indicate that the two groups have different onset and duration of cold illnesses, but they do not show any difference in severity or length of illness. In this study, the literature does not support the treatment of patients with acute respiratory infection; however, it does suggest that daily doses of 200 millig/day may be sufficient to prevent these conditions. This trial was conducted on 641 children attending a navajo school over ten weeks. It found that both groups had reduced the frequency of sick call visits and training days lost during the period. However, there were no differences in the severity of their symptoms either."
22161375,"In this study, the effects of anti-inflammatory agents on blood pressure are compared in patients with moderately acute myo Cardiol infastoic disease. The effect is not significantly different from that of conventional treatment. Acute myofa rcat ionic therapy reduces the overall mortality of women from 31 to 15 p.m., particularly those over 55 years old. Although there is still some risk of complications after percutaneous intervention, it is recommended that aspirin be given for at least four weeks after primary thrombomic therapy. This trial was designed to determine whether an alternative strategy of pretreatment or short-term regimens would be superior to one of no preservative and long- term therapy for only four months after major artery graft repair. It was concluded that these two strategies were more effective than any other combination of preventive and secondary prevention. Arthritas and hypertension are frequent annoyances in the elderly. Anti-irritating drugs can lead to elevation ofblood pressure. These include diuretics, beta blockers, angiotesin-converting inhibitors, centralal alpha-acting agents, and others. They are also associated with hemodynamized acute renal failure."

In this study, the effects of resistance training on muscle mass, strength, function, body composition, quality oflife, among elderly Japanese women who have saropenia are investigated. A double blinded, parallel- group trial was performed among 380 older females with short physical performance battery at age 4 or 9 years. All the subjects were assigned to either an exercise group or a control group. After two weeks, they were given either whey powder or silican as placebo. This study examined the effect of protein supplementation on lean body Mass and Muscle Strength in elderly subjects With scoundrelous obesity. Both groups received three daily doses of each type of food. Anorexia Cachexia Syndrome is associated with elevated morbidity but there are no concluding clinical trials evaluating whether nutrition can improve muscle health. Myostatine is an endgenous negative regulator for muscle growth and has been shown beneficial in adult muscular diseases. Bioelectrical Impedance analysis is used to assess whole body and appendicicular fat mass in community-Dwelling elderly men and women aged 80 and older.

28057512,"This paper describes the results of a walk-well intervention for adult intellectually disabled adults. It is based on an eight-week walking program and will be followed by solitary observation. The aim of the study is to determine the efficacy of walking as an intervention against physical inequities experienced by adults with intellectual disability. In this paper, we describe the Walk Well exercise intervention, which involves three daily consultations and an individualized 12 week walking regimen. We conclude that it is possible to improve health behavior for adults who have intellectual or other learning difficulties."
19491064,"Vitamin D is an important anthelminogen for tuberculotics. In this study, we compare the effect of daily doses of vitamin D with that of placebo in terms of disease outcome and mortality. We conclude that there is little difference in the rate of improvement in patients who receive either treatment or placebo. The results of this trial are as follows: 1) more men than females were in productive age group; 2) more women had low nutrition status; 3) more people have low education level; and 4) less than half-dead body mass. This study also determines whether it is possible to use micronutrient therapy to prevent thrombitosis in humans. It was found that higher levels of both mineral and alkaline diets could reduce the risk of typhoid fever by 45 p.m. overall. Furthermore, studies have shown that increased consumption of these nutrients can help prevent colorecent lung cancer."
27528494,"This paper focuses on the association between maternal and child death in 154 different countries. The results of this study suggest that social determinant may play a significant role in improving health systems aroundthe world. In particular, it suggests that higher access to drinking water, sanitation systems, and corruption are associated with increased child mortality. Although there is considerable uncertainty about the impact of these two approaches on health system and program performance, interrupted time series studies can be used as an alternative measure of impact. It is believed that interruption time sequences have some deleterious effects on hospital care. A recent educational intervention was used to reduce unjustified patient stay by reducing the number of days patients spend in the hospital."
29018489,"In this paper, we report the results of a single-blind, placebo-control study in which resversatrol was shown to improve insulinsensitivity in Type 2 patients. After nineteen patients were assigned to two groups: one group received randolous doses of both ecstasy and placebo; the other group had no effect on either group. The results showed that nalfl disease is associated with increased risk of Type 2, diabetes mellitateus. Aiming to reduce T2D risk through its anti-inflammatory action, our present study uses an eight-week double blinded trial to assess the efficacy of three different dosages -- 500mg reasveratsolate, 40 mg reteralisar, or placebo -- in subjects with newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes. We conclude that these studies have not yet been published."

26003426,"In this study, we examine the changes in physical function after radical prostrateectomy in elderly patients who have received a combination of resistance and exercise training. We find that impact-resisted training prevents increases in body fat than control groups and also improves bone mineral dentition in men with early menopause. This study is aimed at evaluating the effect of strength training for men receiving androgen suppressation therapy. It was found that men had reduced muscle strength and improved functional performance when they were given ADT. The aim of this paper is to develop 'a reliable and reliable checklist' which will help physicians assess both rand and Omized studies as well as predict their adherence to an exercise regimen."
14718486,"This study focuses on the effect of two different exercise regimens over a two-year period on reduction of falls and injury among elderly patients in two long- term care facilities. The subjects are divided into two groups: resistance training, which is designed to improve muscle strength and endurance; and progressive resistive training that is more effective than walking exercise. In older people with chronic disease, such as claudicrious leg weakness or impaired gait, it is suggested that an exercise program would be more successful than either alone. A six-month controlled trial examines the effects of low-to-mode-intension group exercise on strength, endurance, mobility, and fall rate in elderly men with frequent impairments. All residents were eligible except for those with regressive prognosia who had been sent for rehabilitation. Two studies were performed: one was based on population-based methods, whereby all nursing homes were placed into triplets according to patient characteristics; the other was conducted by weighting procedures. It was found that both groups showed significant increases in physical self-esteem after completion of the treatment. Both groups also showed improvement in their health perception relative to attractive bodies, strength/employer's ability, etc. They concluded that they could use this information to predict whether changes in body size and strength will lead to improvements in quality of life."
30709362,"This study focuses on the effects of an intervention with lifestyle change on blood pressure and glucose in subjects with impairing glucose tolerance. The results suggest that this intervention can prevent or delay Type 2 diabetes, but it does not appear to be possible in community setting. In addition, there is no evidence that lifestyle changes can reduce risk of developing type 2 disease in people with preptibetes. Thus, this study uses a cluster-randomized approach to evaluate the effect of group-based lifestyle improvement on body weight and blood sugar in middle-aged Chinese population. After six months, the intervention groups experienced significant reductions in fastingglucoemic concentrations and body mass index. At the 12 month follow-up, they experienced reduced sytolic bp and diastical BP. Aim To investigate the effectiveness of short-mesage service for reducing risk factor for Type 2, diabetes in young workers in the informationtech industry in India.Methods This pilot singleblinded controlled trial was conduct in Hong Kong Between 05/09 and 04/12.Provided short messages were delivered to provide diabetes related information in preventing development of Type 2.Initiated by self-monitoring, we investigated the efficaciousness of 'virtual assistance-base lifestyle intervention' to reduce risks factors forType 2 diseases in elderly individuals who had preptical state.Mean age, 18 years; mean bodymass index: 27.7 kg/m2, mean height in meters.The primary outcome was changing in prevalence of over-expressed overweight/obedsity.AimsTo investigate if ""hypothetical"" lifestyle modification could reduce incident Type 1 diabetes among Indian patients with impropriety.Departure from active counselling was assigned to either routine care or an intense integrated intervention group.Results showed that the treatment group experienced great decrease in FastingGlycation, Body weight, waist circumference, total cholesterol, and HgA1c at the endof 1 year.Battleground In the midst of the epidemic of high-risk adulthood, many studies have attempted to improve the quality of patient education through different approaches.We conducted an un blindedicted, parallel-grouped, individually-random, individual-respectable trial at University of Calchabar teaching hospital in Nigeria.""Our aim was to assess"
26858339,"In this chapter, we discuss the use of a real-time reverse-transcriptional polymerase- chain reaction assay to predict distant relapse in patients with early breastcancer who have no involvement of lymph nodes or estrogen-responsive tumors. The results of this test are compared with those obtained from other studies. We conclude that it is more accurate than conventional methods for predicting distant disease in women with late-stage and metastatic breast cancer. These studies include endopredict, an RNA testing method that predicts distant distant death in men with estrogen/progesterone-recepter-positive breast malignancies; p53, which has been mixed up in several studies; and Ki67, another molecular test used to assess prognostics in breast tissue."

28290160,"In this paper, the authors describe a novel approach to improving patient-centered care in patients at high risks of cardiovascular disease. They aim to use an evidence-based decision support system to help patients make informed decisions about their health and lifestyle choices. The results of the study are as follows: 1) A healthy diet, low in fat and highly in fiber; 2) A risk assessment tool that can be used to predict future risk; and 3) A brief lifestyle change program for those with high risk of heart attack. This trial is designed to recruit 200 primary care patients from Oxfordshire who have no known history of blood pressure or hypertension. These patients will receive either advice on starting statin drugs or information about changing their physical activity over four weeks. After these two studies, we conclude that there is little need for further research into how best to improve patient safety in general practice."
27267795,"This paper describes the five-stage assessment of surgical innovation. It focuses on observational studies, which collect prospective patient information and then later use it to develop new techniques. The first stage is focused on long-term followup; the second stage concerns early-to-mid-life improvement. In this paper, we describe the results of a series of hip arthrostry trials that have been performed for 39 consecutive patients. After nine years, the vertical migration of the Exeter stem has not yet been investigated. However, several other studies have reported that the prosthesis with cement or highly crosslinked polyethylene performs better than those with conventionally high-molecular weight Polyethylene."
24750271,"In this prospective, observational study, we assess the safety of a 5-year-old hypopituityary adult who receives GH replacement for at least two years. The mean initial dose of 0.03mg/day is gradually reduced to 0.41 in this study. We report that men with adultonset hypo pituitanism respond with greater levels of insulin like growth factor I and biochemical marker of bone metabolism as compared to women who do not receive long-term treatment. Four studies have reported early mortality in patients without adequate blood supply. However, there has been some speculation that endogenously growing-hormone deficiencies might account for excess mortality. This study follows up 1014 British patients with hypophutarism between January 1, 1992, and January 2, 2000. It was followed up by 10 14 English patients from January 4, 1992 until January 3, 2000; all subjects had hysteria caused by an Insulin Tolerating test. All subjects received thyrogned growth hormone replacement therapy. Acute growth Hormone replacement leads to increased body composition and quality of life in adulthood but results in high rates of patient withdrawing from it. High-dose growth regimens lead to elevated serum insulin-like grow factorI concentrations that are associated with breast or prostate cancer. These concerns raise major concerns over use of such large-scale growth medication in children."

17943797,"In this paper, we describe the prevalence of a chronic pain disorder in the general community. We examine the presence of ""no pain"" and ""widespreading pain,"" as well as the severity of the disease at different ages. The most common form of pain is described on an 11-point pain intensity numerical rating scale. This scale is used to interpret changes in pain intensity from multiple studies. A followup study is presented for patients with fagmyalgy who have been following exercise classes for six and 12 months. After these subjects complete their treatment, they are then followed by two independent trials: one regarding sleep quality and another regarding effects of moderate physical activity. These studies relate to the use of magnetic electrodes in treating rheumitis."
28445352,"A new perioperative recovery program for breast patients is described in this paper. It uses the American Society of Nurses and midwives' National Survey of Patient-Initiated Professions, which collects information from over 1,500 patients during the period between 2005 and 2011 to predict the risk of complications after immediate breast surgery. The results of this study indicate that an improved recovery regimen will reduce the need for frequent hospitalization and improve patient satisfaction. In addition, the authors present a novel surgical wound infection control technique using pulsed electromagnetic fields. They conclude that these devices can be used to reduce pain and inflammation following mastectomy as well as to prevent complications. Their main aim is to determine whether preemptive antimicrobial sutures can reduce postoperative acute pain by reducing use of morphines or bupiviaaine. This study also examines the effect of passive insulation on body temperature during major open abdominotomy procedures."

We investigate the effect of single-dose glumirin on left valeriosity, activity, strength, weight loss, blood concentration, risk of breast cancer, or anoreziacachexia in patients with acute myopic disease. The results suggest that it may be useful for treating patients who are deficient in growth factor release. A case-controlled study examines the association of commonly genetic variants among the genes containing Ghrelil and its receptor with anthropometry measures, circulating Insulin-like growthfactor-I, IGF-B, insulin- like growth force-binding Protein 3 and breastcancer risk. This study is a prospective observational study designed to compare the safety of treatment with no treatment. It was concluded that there were no significant adverse events in those treated with either therapy. However, some studies have reported negative association between hydrogencobacter prilori and eophageal cadenocartoma. These studies indicate that gastrin can protect against these malignancies by decreasing appetite, food intake, acid production, which could reduce weight and gastric reflux. Furthermore, several studies report negative associations between Hippolyta phosphorus secretion from stomach contents and colon cancer. Many studies point out possible roles of gut chemicals in the natural history of diseases such as colon tumors."

The placebo significantly reduces the risk of infection in patients with cutaneous idias or pedis. In addition, the new antimetic agent econazol appears to be as effective as either the active or the ineffective drug. Mammaplasties are not yet well understood in the medical community."
14974070,"In this study, we examine the effect of three different forms of calcium on bone loss: 1) a daily dose of 1,000 mg. 2) an early-day dose; and 3) two-year-old doses of 1,500mg. The first group loses more bone than the second, but only in the trace mineral groups. This suggests that the dosage used to increase bone is not as strong as estrogen therapy because it does not prevent early bone degeneration. We conclude from our initial results that there is no significant difference in bone mineral content between women receiving either type of treatment. However, these studies suggest that ""calcium supplementation inthe dosage we used was not even as effective as Esther therapy for thepreventing of early post menopausalsal Bone loss""."
29037523,"This paper focuses on the reliability and validity of the psorasis-symptom diary, which is used in two phase III studies. It has been validated for its ability to track changes in severity of pporiases as well as for improving patient quality of life. In this paper, we describe the results of an eight-question patient-reporting outcome measure, the Worst itch Numeric Score, designed to assess the severity at its most severe during the previous 24 hours period. The study also describes the use of short form-36, a commonly used measure of health status, with patients who have Psoriatic Artifacts. We conclude that there are some drawbacks to the score, especially since it is based on negative time tradeoffs between disease activity and satisfaction. A new version of PSI was recently published."

The effects of this intervention on motor activity were not studied; however, there was an association between mood changes and behavior."
25668264,"In this paper, we report the results of an intervention study in patients with high blood pressure who received either nifidipine or co-amizide. The primary outcomes were: cardiovascular death,myocardialinfa rect Ion, heart failure, and stroke. We also examine the effects of antihypertinesive drugs such as losartan on these outcomes. Our main aim is to analyze the association between blood tension and 12 different presentation of acute and chronic diseases. This study was performed for subjects with no previous cardiovascular risk factor, no laboratory proteinuria, low ejective fraction, but who were not treated with any type of treatment. It was concluded that captopriml would be superior to conventional therapy in preventing myocarital infiscibility, stroke, or death. Furthermore, it showed that long term administration of the Angiotensol-converting Enzyme Conversion inhibitor capTopril resulted in reduction in cardiovascular morbity and morbidness in hypertension. A second study examined the effect of amlopidine's combination of diuretic and beta blockers on improving the outcome of diabetic patients. These studies included two groups of patients -- those with untreated hypotension and those without. One group had a target value of 160 mmHhg; the other had only 105 mHg. Although there was no difference in the relative risk of mortality from each group, the proportional risk reduced for stroke in both groups was not significantly different."
27836071,"In this paper, we describe the results of a six-week trial in two centers in Australia to examine the effectiveness and safety of neck pain treatment. Neck pain is common and incurs considerable expense in society and economic terms. The study uses an assessment-blinded approach to determine the prevalence and severity of symptoms in workers. We also identify risk factors that may lead to neck injury. A multimodal treatment plan consisting of exercise, manual therapy, and mechanical neck manipulation may result in improved outcomes for patients who suffer from neck injuries. This study compares the effects of home-based strength training against stretching alone on chronic non- specific neck discomfort. It was found that there was no significant change in pain intensity or quality of life after 12 weeks. Although brief physiotherapies are more effective for acute illnesses than more comprehensive treatments, it is unknown whether this holds true for long-term whiplash-afflicted disorders."
27071989,This study focuses on the use of neurocible testing to predict concusion severity in high school athletes. The results suggest that concoussion scores may be useful for prediction of delayed recovery after injury. Athlettes who have sustained a mild brain injury but do not report symptoms to their health care provider are likely to be at risk for developing long-term consequences.
25452221,"This paper focuses on the effects of age on enteral feeding in infants with very low birth-weight. It compares the effect of continuous vs. intermittent feeding on growth and gastrointestinal tolerance in prematurely weighed infant girls. In this study, we find that early enterals are associated with greater risk of necrotising Enterocolitis than is later observed in other studies. We also report that there is a high rate of morbidity among extremely lowbirth-women patients treated in Spanish hospitals."
27483307,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective observational cohort study in which 1658 patients were divided into two groups: those with low-fat and high-carbohydrate diets and those who were either Type I or Type II. We examined the association between the weight of the obese subjects and their blood levels of prognosi. The results showed that both groups were assigned according to their BMI and Insulin resistance. This was an important finding because it allowed us to examine the relationship between gut microbial composition and the overall health of these patients."
27842225,"This study focuses on the effects of in-patient patient education on pain and activity interference after heart failure. In this study, patients are assigned to either group of two groups: one group is given ""stand and ard"" care or another group will be provided ""care as usual."" The purpose of these studies is to determine whether an individualized self-care intervention delivered above and beyond normal care can improve recovery for patients with heart failing. A pilot study was conducted in which a nurse lead ed nursing care plan was developed for older patients who had been discharged from their hospital. It was found that nurses were better able to help patients learn more about their condition than they were at present. For this trial, we used telemedicine to deliver information directly to patients during their first week of recovery. We found no significant differences in health related quality of life between women and men. HeartCar Care is an I-banding service designed to improve physical function and psychological distress in patients recovering from coronary bypass  Graft surgery. Our aim is then to evaluate the effect of our home-based program on anxiety and depressed symptoms following Coronary Angry Bypass Grafting. After six weeks, all patients receive telephone calls from advanced practice nurses familiar with their conditions and care needs. They also report improved satisfaction with recovery services. There was no difference in age, gender, or severity of illness among the patients receiving the phone call."
22889860,"This study focuses on the relationship between patient-reported fatigue and changes in their behavior over time. The results suggest that patients with more fatigue in the early days of treatment have even more problems than before. A new patient assessment scale, the Memorial Symptom Score, is used to assess the extent of disease recurrence in children with malignancies. In this study, we examine the effect of physical activity on improving sleep and fatigue for children who are receiving treatment for solid tumors or acute myeolimoline leukemia. We conclude that an exercise intervention will be effective in treating these children."
29627967,"In this study, we examine the effect of walking exercise on patients with intermittent paddling. We find that walking is more effective for improving walking ability than other forms of exercise, such as resistance training and strength training. The results of this trial indicate that supervised walking exercises can improve walking performance in people with peripheral arteries disease. A group-mediated Cognitive Behavior intervention was used to promote home-based physical activity in patients who had intermittent clacudication. These patients were assigned to one of two parallel groups: usual care or usual control groups. They were then evaluated at six weeks' time by daily steps, walking capacity, health-respective quality of life, glycosiesylated haemogen values, and fastening lipid profile. This study also determines whether an education program using group support could improve functional performance over a standard health education regimen. It furthermore shows that it has been shown that ""home-base walking"" programs are highly efficacious in improving walkability in persons with chronic artery disease because they involve self-efficiecacy and satisfaction for physical function. However, there is little evidence regarding the effectiveness of these types of exercises in treating patients without conventional symptoms of intermittent caudication."
19821358,"In this paper, we describe a prospective cohort study of patients who have been treated for bacterial vaginis. We conclude that the use of one or more complementary treatments is associated with increased visits to health care. A double blind, placebo-control treatment trial using Lactobacilus acidophilous was successful in curing BV. The results were similar to those obtained from other studies. This study compares and assesss ingestion of either pasteurized Yogurt or containing live L acidphilus as prophylactics against recurrent infection and vaginoses. Forty two healthy women were assigned to receive either capsules enriched with LacTobacillus Rhamnosus G1 or Lactopicillin rhamnoxus RC-14 Probiotic dosage regimen; however, the vanagal floracula was only normal at 40 %) of the cases. Conception loss and early pregnancy recovery were compared by culture and stain results. These results suggest that there may be an advantage in adding probiotics into the treatment of tubal factor disease. Women with suspected virgilia are also recommended for further treatment. Furthermore, several different drugs can be used to treat urogenitis including anti-infective agents such as morphine."
30273409,"In this paper, we describe a pilot study of pre- and post-pregnatal yoga in women with major depressed disorder. The results suggest that the intervention is acceptable and feasible. We conclude that there are several promising approaches to treating depression, including exercise training for patients with anxiety disorders. Aims: To determine the effect of 12 weeks of Hatha Yoga on depression severity; and systemic Biomarkers of Neuroplasticity in adults with Major Depressive disorder On routine drug treatment, generalized anxiety disease is associated with poor response. However, studies have shown that exercise can be used as an effective treatment for these conditions. Our aim is to examine the effects of light exercise or vigorous exercise on postpartum moodiness. Women aged 18-67 years with mild to moderate depression were divided into two groups: one group was assigned to hatha meditation, another to physical poses, and then to waitlist control. This study supports the use of gentle postures and breathing exercises to treat moderately severe depression. It also suggests that it may be more efficacious than other forms of therapy for people with OCD."
29185808,"Curcumin, a potent anti-inflammatory, has been studied in patients with high-risk heart disease. In this study, we investigate the hypolipidemiamic activity ofcurcuminoidas in obese subjects. We examine the effects of these compounds on serum concentrations of lipoprotein and cholesterol, as well as C-react protein levels. The results suggest that curcumnoids may be effective in treating atherogenic hyperlipidemic conditions. Aim: To determine whether curcumin can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events among patients who have low-dentality lipodysolic content. This is an open-label, placebo-blind study. It was designed to assess the efficaciousness of curmulin in terms of improving blood lipid profiles in Type 2 diabetes patients."
31284372,"In this study, we assess the impact a pre-oppressive exercise regimen has on fatigue andquality of life for patients with advanced lungcancer. The results show that an eight-week program improves endurance and performance in patients who have risk factors for Post-Operative Pulmonary Complications. This is the first large-scale intervention to evaluate the effects of post-operatory exercise training on patients suffering from lung cancer. We conclude that it is possible to improve physical health and function in people with small cell lung disease."
25572192,"The safety and effectiveness of iron in patients with acute mountain sickness are compared. Iron is more effective in treating anemia than in the treatment alone, but there are some drawbacks to this form of treatment. In addition, it is not possible to predict how long will be required for blood transfusion after surgery. This study consists of three different groups of patients: 1) patients who have pre-existing disease; 2) those who do not receive any iron medication; and 3) those that receive only iron sucrose. These studies aim to determine whether or not iron can be used as an aid to improve patient health during autologously blood donation. ABD patients usually receive either iron surose or ferric caroxymaltosese at one time per day. However, these trials show no difference in efficacy between the two regimens. Intrvenous iron has been shown to increase haeglobin levels in dialytic patients while maintaining normal iron status in chronic kidney diseases. Although iron deficientiency is frequently associated with poor donor outcomes, many patients fail to tolerate IV iron therapy. Some patients require iron from parenteral food, such as pregnant women with severe postpartum Anemia. Both methods work well in improving hemogloin concentrations in sick patients. One group of physicians uses Ferric Caroxy Maltose to treat patients suffering from hypochondriac disease. Another group uses Ferumoxytin to prevent an infection in renal patients receiving high doses of alfa."
25428524,"In this paper, we describe the effects of a new transdermal therapy on men with low-served testosterone levels. We report that in seven hypogonal men treated by the transdereal patch for 14 months, their serum T levels increased significantly andremained within thephysiological range during the whole treatment period. Men with high testosterone levels may benefit from improved bone mineral dentition and reduced fracture risk. The combination of finasterde and triasteide increases BMD in elderly men without any negative effects on the prognosis. A recent study suggests that an older man's elevated total T level may be due to reduced blood concentrations of DHT. However, no other studies have examined the effect of different mode of orrogen substitute on bone Mineral Dentment. This study is aimed at comparing the benefits of two different modes of replacement therapy: mestelorone 100mg p. O. daily; testosterone undecanorate 160mG i. M. every 2 h;Testoterone enantihate 250mM. Every 21 days; or... single subcutaneous implant of 1,200m G.C. testosterone. Results are compared between younger and older men who received either placebo or trans derective patches. Both groups showed significant improvements in quality of life after 12 months. Brain function was improved in both groups. Angina patients were given long-term dihydrotenometic therapy as an adjunct to their current medicine. They had lower bone mass and strength than normal males. Heuristic changes were observed in these men. Cardiovascular disease was associated with malaccomplished neurohormonal activation resulting in metabolic shift favorably catabolism, vassolator incapability, and lossof skeletal muscles bulk and function. These men also had signs of decline in physical function but did not show any change in brain functions. Biomarkers were calculated for age-related body composition, muscle mass, sexual function, erythrallity, heart failure, etc."
30464474,"This paper reports the results of a large, well-respected study on the efficaciousness of neurofebriate treatment for children and young adults with attention deficit disorder. It is based on an open-label, single-blind trial in which 91 patients aged between 12 and 18 years were randomly assigned to receive either drug or combination of stimulant and/or neurofeedback treatments. The primary aim of the study was to determine whether this form of treatment can be used to treat children with ADHD. In this case, it has been shown that both forms work. A second study compares the effects of two different forms of therapy on children who are suspected of having symptoms of ADHD: one group receives medication while the other receive ""NF"" alone."

Safety and tolerateability were assessed by weight gain during treatment period as well as consumbent length, head circumference, digestive tolerance, and other secondary outcomes. The study was designed to assess the total microbial community in stool samples at 1 week, 1 month, 12 months of Age in 20 infant with Ig E-associated czemA and 20 children without any allergic reaction until 2 years old. We examined the results of an early-day feeding regimen that reduced the risk for eczyma and/or occurrence of asthma in infanthood. A probiotic strain such as LacTobacillus is used as an adjudicator against both acute and chronic irritable disease. Although studies have suggested that prebiotics may help prevent childhood ear infections, there are still concerns about their efficacy."
30364046,"This is a systematic review of the efficaciousness of creative arts treatments in the treatment for posttraumatic stress disorders. The aim was to examine whether creative art therapy, including music therapy and dance/movements therapy, could be used as an effective treatment against PTSD. A literature search was conducted for peer-reviewed literature from inception until December 16th. studies were included in this review if it used r and Omized control trial ; tailed by pseudo RCTs or controlled study designs; tested theefficacy of one particular creativeart therapy described above; and reported improvements to psyche or symptoms. In this paper, we use ten data bases to identify the most promising evidence for the effectiveness of artistic therapies in treating Posttraumatic Stress disorder. We compare the effects of exercise therapy on pain, function, and quality of health in affected women. After eight months of training, the exercise group improved comparing with the control groups in terms of physically function: 20 % -- pain -- 8 %) -- stiffness -- 53 0% -- anxiety -- 41  percentage -- depression -- 27 p.m. -- Fibromyalsgia -- impact question naire -- total scores -- 18  P.M.

Background Only few workplace initiative among cleaners has been reported, even though their occupation constitutes great need of healthy promotion. Methods An cluster-rand and ommized controlled trial was conduct among 294 feminine cleansers assigned to either physical coordinated training or cognitive behavior training. Question ennews about  Musculoskeletal Pain and work ability are completed at baseline but after one year's intervention. Fibrimyalgy is characterized by chronic and long musculonocular pain. Therefore, warm water swimming pool-based exercises may be appropriate for people with familiarity. However, studies examining immediate pain before and after session are rare. This study focuses on the immediate changes that involving cold water pooling over 12 weeks improves mobility skills, balance, fear of fall in women with fibrojaal Gies. Costs to society and to health care were considered in these studies. Thirty female patients had "
31039960,"The aim of this study is to determine the effect of topical antiinflammatory drugs on breast pain in premensopausals. Sixteen women were included in a study, and thirty-six were assigned to either treatment or placebo for at least six months. This study describes an accurate and repeatable method to quantify patients' subjective experience of chest pain. A prospective diary study was conducted with thirty female military healthcare beneficiaries from Walter Reed Army medical center, Washington, DC; they were asked to describe their symptoms before and after receiving treatment. They were divided into three groups: group I consisted of menstrual pain, group II comprised those with cyclicular mastalgya, while group III contained those who had no such disease. Their pain scores were calculated by the visual analog scale as well as the severity of pain score. In addition, differences in breast tissue could be determined using best-in-vivo scintography test. Women suffering from cyclical mammography were also studied. Two doses of ""Afimoxyfene,"" formerly called 4-OHT, were given daily as part of four different regimens. The primaryefficacy parameter was changed in mean pain intensities as measured by Vasses Score. It was found that centchroman, derived from evening primrose Oil, was the first-lines treatment for masttalgiat. Although most Western countries have used gamolenici acid as its first line treatment, it has not been widely used in the United States because of its potential side effects."

In this study, we assess the efficaciousness and safety of an overdose of onaboulinumtixinA in patients who have been overactive for more than three months. We also examine the effect of two different forms of anticholinestry on the treatment of Ury-Incontinence. The first form involves administration of OnabotuliinUMtXin A at n = 200 U or placebo; the second uses baptism to treat detrusosome overactivity caused by spinal cord injury. This study concludes that it is possible to use botulineum-Atoxin as an effective treatment for patients with neurogenetic overactivation."
17054170,"In this paper, we describe the results of two different surgical treatments for patients with chronic ailment. The first is an open sprang in the middle of the spine and the second is obliterated by internal sullenness. This study uses randometry to predict the relative efficacy on both groups of patients. We conclude that there is no significant difference in healing after either treatment. Aim: To compare the efficiacy of local applied glycceryl triinitrate or topical GTT in treating acute analfissure. Methods: Thirty patients are assigned to receive either Ismn / 0.1 %) GTN elution or placebo. After six weeks, all patients have healed completely. Results: All patients had no relapse of symptoms."

These include angiotension-converting enzyme blocker, an antagonizing agent called atenosolol, and long acting Ca antagonists. This study compares the effects of short-term anangotensin inhibitors with those of calcium channel blockers in patients with elevated heart pressure."
26358358,"In this study, we examine the effects of a high fructostese diet on hepatosis and other liver characteristics in healthy but centrally overweight men. We compare two different types of diets to determine whether or not they can be used as potential risk factors for nonalcoholicfatty liver disease. The results suggest that consumption of low-floroses is more effective in reducing blood lipids than conventionally consumed foods. This paper also discusses the use of fructomedes as an anti-diabetic agent."
18197978,"The aims of this paper are to test hypotheses about the efficability of combined treatment for children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. In 100 three children, free of conducting and learning disorders, who responded by short-term Methodate, were remized for two years to a mixture of morphine plus psychosocial treatments that included parental training and counseling, social skillstraining,psyche therapy, and academic aid. Results showed significant improvement across all treatments; however, combination treatment did not result in superior functioning or facilitate methylphini date discontinuance. This paper also discusses the use of mathematical modeling to predict the effects of various drugs on patients. It concludes that ""practical clinical trials"" are used to assess the effectiveness of different types of medicine."
28492950,"In this study, the effects of a high-dose of cannanbinol on healthy subjects were investigated. The results showed that the higher dose of THC resulted in little learning and no changes in working memory. This was due to the fact that rats and mice had much higher concentrations of Cbc than humans. Furthermore, both drugs were found to be highly active in human brains. Although there were no differences between these two drugs, it is believed that they are particularly harmful for mental health. Acute effects from smoking such high dose tobacco are unknown. However, studies have suggested that potency of either substance may be protective against these effects. Therefore, we investigate the relationship between the dosage of CBD and the effect of its combination on patients."
29684790,"The effect of back pain on the lumbro spine and hip joints during everyday activities is unknown. A three dimension real time electromagnetic tracking device is used to track movements of the neck and back in subjects with or without subacute lower back discomfort. Thirteen patients with lowback pain, with either straight leg raises or no symptoms, walk on a laboratory treadmill at speeds between 0.5 and 1.72 M/s. This study investigates whether people with Low Back Pain reduce variability of motion between the pelvics and trunk in the transversal plane during gaits at different speeds than healthy controls. In this study, sixteen subjects were idiveopathic low back sufferers and sixteen healthy volunteers participated. Seventeen men with chronic low-backpain were recruited; thirteen male subjects and eight healthy volunteer subjects performed hip joint ROM tests. These results revealed significant differences between gluteus Maxius and Biceps Femoris for both groups. An objective assessment of posture and function in obese subjects was made using an objective measure of their spine's morphology."
29760482,"The present study investigates the extent of expectedancy in the amount of expectancy that glucose can affect memory performance. After four experimental sessions, subjects are given a sweetener and then they are asked to practice their cognitive assessment battery. In both groups, there is no significant change in blood glucose concentration after either treatment. Acute hyperglyceemia does not alter fibrinogenolysis in older subjects with normal or impaired tolerance. To compare how fasting duration affects blood sugar levels, healthy subjects were divided into four groups: 1) men and women consumed an ""adlibitum"" pizza meal; 2) men consumed aspartamme-sweetened drinks; and 3) young adults consumed sucrose sweetened beverages. This study was designed to examine the effect of preloads upon glucose, insulin, and glutagon- like peptide in humans. Thirty male subjects underwent two75-goral glucose tolerance tests on frequent measures of glucose / insulin, Glp-1, etc. On these occasions, drinking soda did not increase bloodglucosal excursions but rather increased energy consumption. Blood glucose levels improve brain function in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. These studies have been limited because of the lack of evidence for the effects of different types of sweetners on appetite control. However, recent research has shown that increasing circulation of high-circulating glucose may lead to improvements in some aspects of mental health."
31266163,"In this study, we evaluate the bonding performance of two different self-etched resin cements, Relyx Unicem and RXU, for luted partial crowns. The results are reported in this paper. A total of thirty-four patients have been treated with the intended treatment. Two were placed in split-mouth designs; one without enameletching and the other withRX U+E. After 12, 24, 24 and 36 months, USPHS scores were applied to determine the degree of success of each cement. This study is an attempt to compare the long-lasting performance between three different types of cement used for curing dentin on different surfaces. It was found that there was no significant relationship between the strength of the first cement and its second, which was more expensive. However, it was concluded that the second cement had greater bond strength than the third. Thus, the aim of this trial was to assess the effect of selective enamel staining on the fracture resistance of pulpless central incises. We conclude that these preparations do not significantly influence deflection but only slightly increase the rate at which they are etched."

The subjects are assigned either to consume control bread for 8 weeks or to receive either probiotin or Lactobacilus gassersi BNR 17 for 12 weeks. This trial is designed to evaluate the effect of Probiotic and conventional milk on glucose and lipophosphorus levels in type 2 diabetes patients. After six weeks, the subjects were assigned to either diet or placebo. Both groups had significant reductions in totalcholesteride, Triglycerides, LDL, and HDL. These results suggest that proicrobial foods may be effective in treating disease."
29439755,"In this paper, we describe the results of a pilot study in which patients with no previous experience of heart disease were given an individually-taught, machine-learning decision aid to help them make informed decisions about their treatment of their patients' risk for coronary chest disease. The results showed that the intervention was not medicated by gain in information; however, knowledge scores improved in both groups. A second study is designed to determine whether using standardized, patient-specific, and multifactorial ""coronary risk profiles"" can be used as deterministic predictors of how effective telemedicine will be in treating patients who have multiple conditions. This study compares two remote monitoring intensities levels -- low and high -- and usual care among patients suffering from type 2 diabetes or hypertension. Results show that knowledge score improves in the high intensity intervention group but upon further evaluation,we found the effect was unmediciated by gains in knowledge. Two other studies are presented: one evaluating the effectiveness of physician-informed, automated decision support systems on improving patient outcomes in primary care practices in Canada and another examining the use of self-effacing, electronic medical record-based tools to improve patient management of chronic diseases."
31763928,"In this study, we report the effect of an anthelminic-like substance on blood pressure, lipid profile, and endotolary function in patients with Polygenic hypercholestrolemia. After 8 weeks, the active treatment group experienced more favorable percentage changes in total cholesterol, leptinase, as well as other risk factors. This is due to the fact that the antioxidative compounds do not alter these parameters. The results of this trial suggest that some patients may prefer natural treatments over conventional drugs. For example, pine bark extract has multiple potential benefits. However, studies have shown that it does not affect all of these outcomes."
29350873,"In this study, we examine the pain response of 40 healthy volunteers to two types of pre-oppressive heat stimuli: 1) a placebo; and 2) analgesis with oxycotone. We conclude that these tests are not independent predictors of post-operative pain. However, it has been suggested that ""up to 54 %) of the variance on postoperative painful experience may be prediction with preoperative test modality"" with ""suprathresh heat pain."" This study aims to explore whether any preoperative assessment can predict high pain score and functional limitations after total kneearthroplasty. It is reported that patients with severe pain prior to Tka have ten times higher likelihood for moderate to severe discomfort at six months after surgery than those with mild pain during the first trial."

This study focuses on the association between blood concentrations of vitamin D and severity of acute asthma attacks. In this study, we examine the relationship between levels of 25-Hystericalvitamin D from 1024 infants with mildly to moderate persistent asthma. We find that patients with elevated 25hhVD have an increased frequency of severe asthma attack than those with lower levels."
22142898,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights et al.1s long-term effects of iron on infant development are described. The results of the first two studies suggest that treatment with iron does not lead to rapid improvement in anemiad infants. However, the second study suggests that iron may have some beneficial effects on brain function as well. This is one of several recent studies reporting on the effect of daily iron or iron-containing supplements on children's mental and physical health. Wollstonecraft uses a doubleblind, randomized, placebo-control trial to determine whether iron supplementation improves school performance among iron deficient anecdotes in India. A double blinded clinical trial is conducted in Japan to assess the effects for iron consumption on blood iron concentration and learning achievement among Iron-deficient Anemic children. There are no significant changes in mean ferritsin, transferrinate saturation, free rythrocyteprotoporphyrein levels, or hemoglobin after treatment. No tests were performed on statistical comparisons between these groups. After three mo of treatment, there were significant improvements in means Hgb, haemolin values, and transferralin saturation among both groups; no differences were observed among either group. Pretreatment psychological test results show that ""IDA"" produces altering effects upon visual attention and concepts acquired in iron poor babies."
26558494,"The effectiveness of bright light therapy in patients with winter affective disorder is compared. There is no difference in severity of depression while treatment is carried out, but the diagnosis and medication do not affect the antidepressive response. Fifty five patients were treated with an electric light visor, a new device that uses light to induce depressive symptoms. In this study, we examine the effects of two different intensities of lighting on the frequency of depressed symptoms during the winter season. We conclude that it is possible to prevent depressants from occurring in the fall and winter by using light-induced changes in mood. A patient's relapse rate is significantly higher when they start light treatment early or later than those who stop treatment late in their illness. This suggests that there may be some risk of premature deterioration due to increased suspense over the course of the year. Winter affectives are characterized by major depressions that occur every year at same time. Light therapy is the best available acute treatment for these disorders, however, and long-term use of daily light has not been proven effective in treating them."
25643669,"In this paper, we report on the effects of a daily dose of 25-hydroxyvinculomin D in children with asthma. We conclude that this treatment may lead to short-term or marker of bone turnover in patients with severe asthma who have been treated with an inhaled powdered form of vitamin D for four weeks. This study is important because it provides evidence that early-life use of these nutrients may be associated with reduced risk of developing allergic diseases. The results of this study indicate that infants receiving early levels of blood-soluble or food-based forms of Vitamin A and D are at greater risk than those receiving conventionally-dosed versions."
25807223,"In patients with congestive heart failure, a catheter-based approach to ablation of the atrium has not been shown to be effective. A recent study suggests that transmural lesions may be associated with increased risk of stroke. This is an important consideration in the management and treatment of these patients. The authors describe several studies on the use of pulmonary vein isolation as an alternative to antithrombotics for atrial fillation. These studies include two case-control studies designed to assess the efficacity of either method. One was able to predict the effect of pulsed-vein isolated therapy on left ventricle function in patients who had severe left vs. ventricular dysfunction. Another was used to determine the effects of irregular sequence of pacer intervals on cardiac function during attrioventricular node abclusion."
24474283,"The aim of these studies is to compare the effect of Emodain on long-term periodontal healing in patients with a wide range of deep, interdental defects. In this study, Emdogan was used as an adjuvant to open flap surgery for deep intrabony debridements. Both treatments resulted in significant gains in patient attachment level and pocket depth. This study also focuses on the use of embroidering matrix derivatives such as Em Dogahin or EmDoamin to treat deep Introbonies."
29770953,"In this study, we examine the effects of physical exercise intervention on men receiving androgen-deprivation treatment for prostate cancer. We compared two different approaches: 1) an individual tailored home-base aerobic and light resistance training program; and 2) weekly group sessions. The results of these studies indicate that physical activity can improve health in patients with breast or prostitutes who are not physically active. Although there is some evidence that such behavior change can be beneficial, few studies have examined its efficacy. This paper uses semistructured interviews to assess engagement and retention among males from the Manup study. It was found that ""males experience shorter lives expectancy and high rates of chronic disease comparing their female counterpart"" and that information technology may be more effective than face-toface, telephone, or print-based approaches. Men's health has been shown to be improved by diet and exercise, but few trials have investigated how well these practices are able to influence patient engagement. For example, a weight-bearing strength training regimen could improve physical function in men suffering from localized prostatecancer. However, many men fail to engage in adequate levels of activity because they do not know how to increase their fitness. A novel lifestyle intervention designed to improve the health of adult cancer victims is being developed."
30712238,"In this study, the authors describe the success of immediate transmumucosals in grafting bovine bone into an extraction socket. They report that there are no significant differences between the control group and the patients with inferior results. The aim is to compare the depth of the bucccal bone defect after immediate implantation versus delayed placement of titanium tooth implants with acidetched surfaces. Forty six patients were assigned to the I-m or De groups and received one implant at the canine, premolar, or maxillary region ofthe maxila or the M and ible regions. After 10 days, they were placed immediately and provisionalized within 3 months. Twenty-three patients had teeth replaced by root fracture, caries, endocarious lesions, periodontal diseases, etc. This study was followed up by a subsequent follow-up study on the efficacy of single-unit prosthetic restorations. These studies showed that all three types of prostheses performed successfully: immediate, immediate loading, and post-exertment."
24369149,"In this study, we examine the effects of a graded dose of testosterone on various body composition, muscle size, strength, power, sexual and mental functions. We conclude that testosterone is an effective treatment for men with Type 2 diabetes but that it has not been well studied in other patients. A double blinded placebo-control study was performed to assess the effect of oral testosterone deprivement on blood sugar, lipids, and insulin resistance in middle- aged men without type 2 disease. The results showed that subjects had improved their health after three months of treatment. Although there were no significant changes in these patients' health during the trial, some studies suggested that higher levels of testing may be associated with greater risk of developing Type 2, Type 3 and Type 4 disease"
30215045,"In this paper, the authors present a large population-based registry study of elective surgery in order to determine whether or not prophylactic antimicrobials are effective in preventing superficial surgical site infection. They conclude that routine antibiotics should be used in patients who have an acute calculous gallstone disease and do not have other risk factors for complications. Acute calculustitis is the most frequent complication after electives laparoscopiccholecychstectomy. Although there is still debate as to whether it is appropriate to use profectic antibiotic during electively laposcopic cholestectomy, several studies have suggested that regimens may be sufficient. The aim here is to assess whether proprophylaxises are useful in treating low-risk patient groups with acute cholinecysitis. This study was conducted at Bankura Sammilini Medical college and hospital from January 10 to July 2011; all patients were randomized into two groups: one group received cefacin 1 g before surgery and another group gave no propropylaxes. These results suggest that propholactic antibiotic treatment does not reduce the rate of infectious complications following electative lapaloscopic choneciastomies because of the small size of wounds and reduced scarring. Furthermore, these studies indicate that some surgeons continue to prescribe pre-proposal antibiotic treatments out of habit, tradition, or just as defensive practices due to evolution of medicolegal implications of ""a huge number of surgeries Being showcased as Daycare or Next day discharge procedures."""

It compares results in exercise performance to daily adistance in peripheral arteries disease after two different types of exercise regimens: 1) an at-home exercise program; and 2) regular care control. In this study, we assess the effects of walking intervention on patients who have intermittent clausdication. The primary outcome is improvement in walking ability over time. We also examine the effect of arm cranking on walking performance in people with chronic intermittent caudicure."

The primary effect was change from base to week 8 on the Montgomery-Aberg Depression Rating Score. This endpoint was established and varotioxeneine was superior to an agomelarine by 2.2 Madras points. Context Aim: To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tollability of vortigoXeten 10 and 20 mill/d versus placebo for patients with major depression disorder. Methods Patient were divided into three arms: 1) subjects were assigned to vortitiometine 15 or 20 mg; 2) subjects received either placebo or duloxeletine 60 mg daily; and 3) subjects entered a two-week blinding discontinuation period after assessment potential discontinuations symptoms. Rationality VortiOxEtine has reduced Depressive symptoms in adult with Major depressive disorder in multiple studies. These studies are designed to assess the efficacity of different doses of drug in different types of patients. For example, patients who had relapsed after acute treatment were given Lu AA2104, which is an antidespressant that modulates several receptors but does not cause any side effects. Furthermore, these studies have shown that it is possible to use positron emitting tomography to track changes in blood concentration as well as to predict the severity of adverse events."

We use machine learning to model the patient's actions and then use these predictions to track changes in their behavior over time. The results of the study are presented in two parts: 1) an assessment of relevancy of medical search results by three different interface methods for the Pubmed search system; and 2) an evaluation of heart rate variability in bipolar patients. This is the first study to examine the association between mental health symptoms and the use of smartphones as tools for predicting mood and physical activity in young adults."
18554425,"Iron-forted school breakfasts in Peru have been introduced to combat childhoodiron deficiencies. In this paper, we examine the effects of adding iron to a school meal by evaluating the absorption of iron from test meals. The results indicate that the addition of Fe ascorbicic acid significantly increases iron absorbtion from these tests. Children with anemia or recurrent infection are particularly susceptible to fortifying their iron status. This study is aimed at determining the effect of ferritin, haemologlobin and transferrin on iron stores in children without infection. Pregnant women receive 100mg elemental Fe daily throughout their pregnancy but remain constant in the treatment group. Fish sauce is used frequently in Vietian households to improve iron levels. A double blinded field study was conducted in one highland and control community where only sugar and three vitamins A were provided. Anemic women received supplements or treated. Fortification of fish sauce with Fe allowed improvement in blood concentrations among pregnant women. Women of childbearers age between 20 and 30 years were assigned to three different treatment groups: unfortify soy sauce, low NafeEDTA, and high NaFeEDA."
19885644,"This study focuses on the effects of two rest breaks per day on workers' symptoms and performance. Workers are assigned to either an ergonomic intervention group or a combination of exercise and job stress management groups. In this paper, we examine the results of three different types of exercises: 1) conventional breaks; 2) supplementary breaks plus four five min breaks each day; and 3) no stretching. We conclude that these studies have been successful in preventing upper-limb pain from occurring among health care employees. The primary goal of this study is to determine whether ""empowerment learning"" can be successfully used as preventive measures against work-related lower-extremity pain. A pilot study has been conducted with nurses who suffer from neck pain for six months. It was found that there were significant improvements in back pain after the intervention. Another study investigates the effect of using escorts to reduce shoulder pain during workstation shifts. These changes result in improved posture and reduced fatigue. Two other studies compare the use of scaffolding to increase arm strength. One study uses electrodes instead of mechanical support boards to assess the efficiacy of employing them. Other studies focus on improving wrist tension by using forceful motion."
26381811,"In a parallel group study, 60 healthy volunteers were assigned to receive either 100 or 200mg modafinill. After two hours of sleepiness and tiredness, they completed extensive cognitive tests. The 200 mg group performed better than the other groups in reaction time, memory, and rapid information processing. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging was used to detect regions of brain responses to change in sensory stimulus. Although there are no significant differences in cortical activity between control and non-sensible subjects, methamphhetamine-dependent individuals show deficits in their prefrontal function. A recent study has shown that combined with hypnotics can improve mental performance in patients with neuropsychic disorders. In this present study we have tested an efficacious combination of both drugs to improve learning and neural activities related to cognition in healthy people over two weeks. Thirty-three healthy volunteer volunteers received either modacull or placebo. They had been trained to perform multiple tasks during the course of the study. Modaffinl is regarded as 'low addictive' but has also been used for treating narracolepsy. This study investigates the effects ofmodafinity on working memory functions in humans. It was found that it improved short-term memory consolidation under conditions of insomnia. However, it did not improve long-lasting memory improvement."
20351229,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective observational study of 2725 patients who had undergone conventional coronary angioplasty from January 1998 until December 2005. We examined the effect of contrast material on the outcome of these patients and found that there was no significant increase in the risk of complications induced by its use. The rate of morbidity or mortality after radical grafting for carcinoma was compared with that of other post-surveillance methods. This study furthermore examines the relationship between periodic glycation and the subsequent risk to infection. It was concluded that hyperglicemia may lead to an increased short-term suspense and that it is therefore not recommended for patients with Type I or Type II type of diabetes."
24708875,"In this study, we examine whether methadone dependence, tobacco smoking or their combination results in impaired performance on gambling tasks. We find no significant differences between groups on GT performance compared to depressive symptoms and childhood attention-deficion hyperactivity disorder. This study assesses the relationship of weight to intellectual development in the port pirie birth cohort. The children's chronological age was measured using Bayley scales of infant development at age 2, 4, 7, 11 and 13 years; respectively. A cohort of 100 newborns exposed to maintenance methadone in triumvirate were followed for 6 months. These patients had a mean duration of 27 weeks from first opiate dose to cessation. Mortality rate and rateratios comparing intervals in and outside of treatment adjustedfor sex, age, calendar year, and social risk were also examined. Pregnancy has been reported as associated with reduction in newborn weight. Norwegian mothers have been pregnantly exposedto opiates during pregnancy under conditions of little postnatal socialrisk. They are pregnant women treated with buprenarephine but have an adverse perimenarchal syndrome that often requires medication. Buprenorphinic agonist is used as an alternative treatment but has not yet been studied in pregnancy."
31948489,"In this paper, we describe the effect of a two-prolonged treatment program on adherence to medication in 1031 patients with Major depression. The results suggest that patient characteristics can predict whether or not they will eventually fall into complete relapse after their first antidepressive treatment. This study is aimed at identifying predictors for patients' nonadherence and comparing them to those of patients who are already taking an extended regimen of antipsychotics. We conclude that patients do not always follow through with their treatment because of several risk factors, such as substance misuse, lower symptomatologies, and negative attitude toward medication."
29474541,"In this study, the effect of a novel bonding technique on enamel surfaces is investigated. The results are compared with that of conventional methods. A total of sixty teeth were divided into two groups and each group was assigned one of three different types of bonds: TransbondXt, Maxic Elite, and Hybrise. Both agents were used to bond thirty fluorosisd teeth; in the first group, they were bonded by light bond, while in second, it was bounded with Hybroskov's Ligature Adhesion Promoter. After bondment, all teeth had cracks after debondation. This study uses stereomicroscopic analysis to determine the extent of crackling before bondering and afterdebonding. It also uses two-way analyzers to compare the amount of remnants and length of cracked enamel pieces."
29988399,"In this double blinded, placebo controlled study, 30 subjects with significant aggression were assigned to receive either vaproate or placebo for eight weeks. No treatment difference in vapropex was observed between the two groups. The efficacy is compared to that of occarbazepam in bipolar disorder and children and adensified by age. Bipolar I disorder is considered manic-manic but not mixed episode. Liv+ and DvvX are used as maintenance monotherapies for youths who have been stable on combination Lix and Divalproex. Children with anxiety disorders are initially treated with CZP; however, they do not show any improvement in their symptoms after six weeks of treatment. This study examines the effect of levetiractam on tics in patients with Tourette Syndrome. Acute-phase treatment regimens are divided into three groups: lithium, dival proex, and carbavamazepinE. For acute phase treatment, battery-operated devices are administered at an average dose of 200mg/day. After 6 weeks, electroderinogen is added to the regimen. Adolescents aged 8 to 17 years old with severe mood disturbances respond well to these treatments. Lamotrigine is also shown to be effective in treating aggressive behavior in children with attention-deficive hyperactivity disorder."
30135848,"This study demonstrates the bonding of self-etch, selfadheshing resin cements onto dentin without the aid of an etching technique. The results show that the bonds are stronger than those of conventional adhesives. In this paper, the authors compare the performance of two different types of adhesive systems in treating noncarious lesions. They use clearfil se bond and ibond gluma inside to demonstrate the superiority of these two systems over other anti-carrying materials."
21898039,"In this study, we assess the safety and efficacy of an analogue form of desmolopressin for the treatment of multiple sclerics with noctura. We conclude that it is safe and efficacious to use desmopressedin in patients with moderately relapsing urethic disease. A double blind, crossover study was carried out on twenty-two women aged under 65 years with mildly deformed pleiosis. After two weeks of placebo-controlled studies, desmosopressive effects were observed. The results suggest that desmodo pressein may be more effective than placebo in treating pityless orphaned men who have urgatory. This paper also describes a prospective, long-term, population-based study of female urinary inconstinence."
22643828,"The Ehs Guides for the treatmentof inguinal shenia are based on evidence from large-scale studies and have been reviewed by a steering committee. Long term discomfort after incision has become an important issue, especially since laparoscopic surgery is more frequently performed than shouldice repair. In this paper, we report that long-term complications are most likely to be caused by older age, higher mental component score, and greater body mass index. We also present results of recurrent hernisas as predictors of short-time and overall complications. Although there is no national study on how best to perform herina surgery, several Danish hospitals have recorded 26304 patients who undergone hernial surgery in Denmark between January 1,1998) and June 30 th 2000. Our aim is to establish if overweight and obesity can predict future hernic pain in men. This study was designed to investigate psychological risk factors for chronic post-surgery pain after elective primary open ingulal heronio surgery. It found that anxiety, depression, fear avoidance, activity avoidancy, catastroizing, worries about the operation, activities expectations, perceived paincontrol and optimism were associated with increased pain at the end of the study."
31165921,"In this paper, we examine whether dialectical behavior treatment is more effective in reducing self-harm than enhanced normal care. We compare DBT-a with enhanced usual care for 77 adolescents who have had recent or repetitive self harm treated at community children and apoxetically assigned to either DBD-A or UcC. Admitting that history of abuse has been associated with poor response to combination therapy, the authors report that those without physical abuse or sexual abuse are three times less likely not to respond to an adequate serotonein re uptake inhibitor. The results of this study indicate that young people who receive medication for sleep do not respond as highly as those who received no sleep medication. This study also reports on the relationship between parent child discord and disease outcome in patients with major depression. It concludes by identifying predictors regarding recovery among treatment-responsive depressed youth."
24123837,"This study focuses on bonding strength of two different types of cements to an intascalized, sintered Zirconium surface. Bonding is performed using three different surfaces: airborne particle abraded, Silica-Coating, and No Abrasion. The shear bond tests are carried out at various loading conditions. In this paper, the effect of several different surface treatments -- air bearing powder abradered, silico-coating; no abrision; and alchemy -- on the bond between resin cement and zircon is described. After four different treatment methods, all specimens are loaded in tension for fracture. Shear bonds are calculated by ANOVA with Tukey Holmwood's test results."
17667645,"The results of a number of studies suggest that exercise and lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of coronary disease in men and women, but no evidence exists for this effect. This study tests the efficacy of an intensely physical exercise program on patients older than75 years with stable angiographical lesions. It was found that these regimens improved total work capacity and health-regarding quality of life within each age group. In addition, it showed that stress had been associated with poorprognosis after myomyocardially infac rctic ion. A nurse run practice could improve secondary prevention among patients with heart disease. Nurse run practices were more effective in reducing the severity of their patients' symptoms and improving their general health. They also showed greater improvements in physical strength and endurance when compared with control groups. Another study examined the effects of ""home-based"" or ""outpatient"" cardiac rehabilitation programs on reduction of blood pressure and body mass. After two years, there was significant improvement in both patient knowledge and satisfaction as well as reduced frequency of readmissions from the hospital. These studies further investigated the value of home-informed care for patients who had acute myoratory inda ribct Ion; they concluded that such care would lead to better outcomes than usual care."
30329174,"In this paper, the authors describe a prospective, i.e. random, study to compare the effects of two different treatments on patients suffering from oral submoucous fiss: aloe Vera gel and physiotherapy. Forty patients were included in order to participate in the study. The first group received alome vera for three months; the second group was treated with black pepper/nigella spilt extract. After 3 months, they performed an open-ended follow-up assessment after 9 months."
17443609,"In this paper, the authors describe a prospective study of 100 patients who undergone elective choecystestectomy. The results are similar to those of other patients in terms of age, weight, and diabetic history. There is no difference in wound infection or complications between the groups. Both groups have shorter durations of drainage than open drains; however, there is an increased incidence of fever during the first day of operation. A comparison of closed suction and open passive draining is made in order to determine the effect of these two different methods on the patient's health. Although lapartoscopic cholesctomies have rapidly become the standard treatment for gall bladder disease, it remains unclear whether they will be successful."
14870716,"This study focuses on the effects of weight training and exercise on nursing home residents' physical performance. It is a prospective, observational study that compares functional status over an eight-month period to those who have no health complications or are not fit for long-term care. The FFLTC fitness program was designed to improve strength, balance, flexibility, mobility, and function. In addition, it was tailored to meet the need of both low and high mobility residents. Both groups receive ongoing treatment, follow- up, restorative treatments, but enhanced groups received more hours in service. A Swedish community aged 70 through 80 years were invited to take part in this nine-week balance training study. Out of 15 interested subjects, 15 were selected at rand and Omized; 15 other subjects were also selected. Before and After the investigation period they had balance tests and Dyna Posturography. They improved their balance scores in the three most difficult conditions. These results suggest that physical therapy may be useful for elderly patients."
27006144,"In this paper, Dr. Manette focuses on the association between drug use and driving performance in road crashes. He uses a case-control approach to examine the effect of dexamphamine on driving performances. Twenty healthy subjects completed two treatment regimens; twenty healthy volunteers completed one treatment condition. The results were as follows: there was no significant difference in driver performance after either group of treatments. After two trials, vehicle performance was assessed at 2.5 h following each treatment."
22094998,"In this paper, we examine the effects of a prize-based reinforcement program on abstinencing smoking in two different treatment conditions. We find that the odds of winning varies depending on the size of an incentive. For heroin and cocaine abusers, the largest incentive is associated with greater probability of abstaining until the next collection day. The results of this study suggest that incentives to quit smoking are not sufficient to prevent premature death from smoking. A second study investigates whether ""vouche-re reinforcement therapy"", which uses rewards to motivate pregnant women to stop smoking, can be effective for improving maternal health during pregnancy. This study compares the efficacy of using vouchers to encourage early absorption of drugs in patients who have been drugged before."
29119235,"In this study, we investigate the effect that a probiotic-rich diet can have on patients with chronic alcoholic syphilis. We conclude that it is superior to conventional treatment in reducing body fat in patients who are already suffering from liver disease. Probiotics may also help reduce small intestinal feces and improve the absorption of other bacterial species."
21584485,"This study compares the psychological properties of three balance measures: the Berg Balance scale, the balance sub-scale of the Fagl-Myyer test, and the postural assessment scale for stroke patients. The results indicate that the measure is highly sensitive to certain thresholds of severity in strokepatients with a wide range of neuronal and functional impairment. In contrast, both measures show little effect on pain at some points during the acute stage of stroke. A comparison between the reliability and validity of each measure was made upon the basis of all group of patients as well as three separate groups categorized by degree of illness."
29420053,"In this study, we examine the effect that a daily consumption of virgin olive oil has on blood pressure and weight in Moroccans. The results indicate that the daily regimen is more effective than the other two regimens: 1,751 g/d for butter, 2,557  244) kcal per day; and 1,716 mmol/day for VAO. We also compare the risk of heart disease among American Heart Association members with those of four different cholesterol-reducing diets -- an American Heath Association/Nationalcholesterol Education program Step II diet, coconut oil, palm oil or peanuts and ""peanut butter"" -- as well as three high-musfa diet studies -- Arabella Oil, sunflower oils, and polyunsulated fatty fats such as coconut milk. This study concludes that low-fat foods are associated with increased susceptibility toward cardiovascular disease because they increase triacylglucrol and decrease lipoprotein content. However, there is little information about how to lower these levels by using either monounstasified olioic or alpha-lainic acid. Furthermore, it is not known whether any of these new approaches will lead to improved health."
25040784,"This study focuses on the effects of a three-month multicomponent program on desk-based workers' sitting time. The aim is to determine whether this program can reduce excessive sitting and improve work-related health. In particular, the study will investigate whether it can be used to reduce long periods of sitting that are associated with elevated risk for type two diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancer; in addition, it will also show whether or not it has an effect on blood sugar levels."
12496220,"Preterm infants are divided into two groups based on their gestational period at birth. In the older group, they receive breast milk while in the younger group it is a formula. A large study is being undertaken on early post-natal growth of preterm children. The first trial compares banked human milk with 'preterm formula' and compare this to whey or other feeds as supplements for maternal milk. This report describes an interim analysis by which the early Post-Narrator growth performance of 194 prematurely bred pre term infant girls was compared to that of 181 healthy adults who were fed either diet alone or through different feeding methods. Both studies showed significant differences in weight gain and length gain among the three types of feeding. One group received milk obtained from mothers of low birth weight; one group got milk produced during pregnancy by mothers only; and another group had no control over the feeding schedule. These results suggest that there may be some risk of infection in these groups. However, both groups have significantly lower rates of mortality than those receiving breastmilk alone."
28496859,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to treating patients with atrium fibrillation. They use flutter as an outcome measure and compare the effects of rate control and rhythm control on patients who have had heart failure. The results suggest that amiodraone may be more effective in improving their patient's quality of life than rate-control or pacemaker therapy. A second study is designed to determine whether rapid conversion of acute atrial fibrillation to sinus rythme can be achieved by using class IA, IC, and III antiarctic agents or vernkalant hydrochlicide. This study uses dummy controls to assess the effect of i butilide fumamine on treatment of patients after coronary bypass graftting. It also employs aviodarone as its main antiarrhythmical agent. Dofferlide is shown to be particularly efficacious in restoring normal sinus rhythm in those with recent-on-onset arrhythmius. RanoLazine, an antianthropic agent, has been used for long-term management of severe heart failing."
23786819,"In this study, we examine the effects of diets based on low-Glycemic Load and high-Glucose Consumption on weight loss in overweight adults. The results are similar to those obtained with conventional low fat or low Glyc load diet regimens. We conclude that there is no evidence for long-term change in body weight when compared to these two types of foods. This study furthermore investigates the effect of changing the amount of carbohydrates in patients with Type 2 diabetes. It was found that changes in blood sugar levels were not due to an acute or chronic nature of the disease but rather resulted from altered glyceric load."
31267483,"In this paper, Pollock focuses on the effect of short-brisk walking exercises on fitness and risk factors for heart disease. He concludes by comparing the effects of two different types of exercise regimens: one that involves long bouts with no resting time and another that includes short bout only. The results show that both groups have significant increases in muscular strength and body composition after six weeks of walking. Menopause is associated with rapid declines in physical health and may lead to changes in bone mineral dentition, aerobic fitness, muscle strength, and balance. This study compares three different patterns of frequent walk with an interval between two walks. One group uses a long routine while the other uses short ones. Both groups are assigned to either lb or nebbly assignment. They are divided into four groups according to their age and gender. Each group receives daily walking sessions at 70-80 percent of predicted maximum heart rate. These subjects do not change their diet."
29481342,"This study focuses on the preoperative patient characteristics of patients who undergo shoulder rotator-cuff repair. The results of this study suggest that there is a significant relationship between psychological status and outcome after shoulder surgery. Preoperative anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances are associated with worse outcomes than those caused by workers' compensation. In addition, patients with more psychological distress report less improvement in pain and function after recovery from shoulder repairs."
31461147,"Estrogen and progestine therapy are effective for relieving symptoms in older women. A brisk menopause causes changes in body mass, but there is little evidence that these effects are permanent. The effect of estrogen replacement therapy reduces the increase in lean body weight and fat mass in post-menopatraal women aged 40-65 years. This study focuses on the influence of two different forms of treatment on body composition: exercise and hormone replacement medicine. In this trial, we examine the effects of three different types of regimens on both body size and strength. We find that exercise improves muscle mass while HRT does not. However, it does lead to reductions in total body fat and increases in bone loss."
28286250,"In this study, we examine the effect of anti-inflammatory piroxic treatment on muscle performance in elderly patients. We conclude that it is better to use NSAid treatment with heat shock proteins to prevent infection-related inflammation and increase expression of protective Hsp than to antibiotic treatment alone. This study further investigates the association between sarcosis and hospitalization costs for older patients who have had an acute infection. Acute inflammation leads to loss of muscular mass and reduced physical activity. The objective of these studies is to compare the effects of post-elective surgery on nutrition and body composition in patients with chronic disease. Postoperatively, patients lose their muscle mass but improve their functional status. They also experience improved recovery after major surgery."
27799615,"In this paper, the authors describe a study of type 2 patients with Type 1 diabetes who are mentored by physicians in order to improve their blood glucose control. The subjects were divided into three groups: group 1, which received usual care; group 2, which was assigned to an ""intervention group""; and group 3, which consisted of only regular care. A total number of 328 patients from 35 family practices in the provinces of Macula, Spain were recruited for this study. This study is designed to evaluate the benefits of using telemonitors on improving laboratory tests levels and Knowledge, Attitude, Practice, Self-Efficacy, and Self Empowerment of patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Iran. Methods include evaluating the effects of telephone coaching on improved laboratory test levels as well as knowledge, attitude, practice, self-efficiecacy and self improvement of types1 and 2 diabetics in India. These studies aim to reduce the burden of barriers to taking medication in older people with type2 diabetes. They also examine whether adding phone-based applications to primary care will reduce gycated hemogloin levels in adults with poorly controlled disease. Although these studies have not yet been published, they suggest that such approaches may be more cost effective than traditional methods."
29075315,"The purpose of this paper is to compare the safety and cost-effectiveness of both surgical and non-surgical approaches for patients with acute appenicitis. A case control study found that patients who were initially treated with open or laparoscopic appendectomy had a remarkably low relapse after one year, compared to those who received conventional treatment. This would be particularly useful since it would allow the surgeons to predict which patients would recover more quickly than other patients. Furthermore, the results of such studies would help in predicting future patient outcomes."
30608987,"In this study, we examine the effects of NSAid treatment on muscle performance in elderly patients who have acute infection. We also investigate whether systemically-inflammated disease is associated with organ dysfunction and physical performance. This study uses a doubleblind random-experimentation design to determine whether injury-induced inflammation is related to muscular function. The outcome measures include changes in muscle fatigue resistance, grip strength, and mobility. Acute inflammation leads to an increased suspense in the immune system, which compromises the outcome of illness. An inpatient exercise program improves functional capacity and quality of life in older adults hospitalized for pneumonia."
22963896,"A number of controlled trials have been performed to evaluate efficacy in treating depression, including a double blinded, placebo-control study for 18 patients who met the DSM III-R definition of ""primary"" or ""early-onset"" primary depressive disorder. The results of these studies indicate that sertraline is superior to imipramin in terms of improving symptoms and quality of life. Although there has been little evidence for antidepressedants in older adults with minor depressions, several studies have examined the effects of acute or maintenance treatment on mental health. In one study, sertriline was shown to be more effective than pill in relieving major depression while in another, it was associated with greater improvements in social and vocational function. Finally, an international, multi-centre, placebo-controlled trial was undertaken to examine the safety and effectiveness of motogenmide, amipramine, and imipromine in the management of chronic depression."
26210190,"In this paper, we describe a prospective study of thirty-six women who have undergone liposusuction to determine the effects on fat distribution and risk factors. Thirty six healthy women were randomly assigned to undergo either abdomination or circumferential surgery. The results showed that there was no significant change in body mass over time. We also report that patients with disproportionately large attic depots had greater risk of developing an anatomy of redisposition than those without such depot"
30046586,"In this study, we investigate the efficaciousness of a mud bath in treating knee osteoarthritis. We conclude that it is safe and effective for patients with knee pain. A large-scale, cross-sectional study is performed to assess the effect of short wave therapy on pain intensity, function, and health-regarding quality of life among elderly patients who have knee or hip Osteoartritis."
30463581,"This study aims to assess the effect of active riding with an electric-assistant bicycle on heart rate and body composition in overweight and untrained young adults. Thirty two men were recruited, and they completed their laboratory measurements as well as blood lipid profiles and mean arterial bloodpressure. They were instructed to ride the e-bike at least three days a week for 40 min each while wearing gps devices. The following four weeks are spent testing the effects of exercise intensity on postprano and Ial  Glycemia; however, the results of this study are not well understood. In addition, there is no association between active walking and bicycling and all causes of mortality. Acute high-intention interval training improves glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes."
25862243,"A prospective, uncontrolled study evaluating the effects of floating spa therapy on pain and quality of life for patients with a classical or deterministic rheUMAtoid disease. Forty adults were divided into three groups: group I received daily mudpacks, group II had daily hot salt baths; group III was treated with mineral water bath packs and sodium chloride. The results were statistically significant for up to 3 months in most of these clinical indiceses. Thirt thirty patients who had classical-or-definite arthritis were assigned into two groups. Each group served as an assessment by one doctor before treatment. In this study, all patients were evaluated both before and after treatments. After two weeks, each patient was evaluated by his/her own physician. This study is designed to evaluate the rapid and delayed effects that are observed in patients suffering from severe psoliatic arthritis. Both groups receive daily sunrays and frequent bathing at their respective beach resorts. Psoriatic diseases such as arthritis, fibromyalsis and gout have been used extensively in various European and American countries. There has been no evidence of any efficacy in treating these diseases. However, recent studies have suggested that there may be some benefit in using physical exercise and other forms of self-relief. For example, several studies suggest that combined heat and cold bathes can be effective in relieving pain caused by irritable joints."
19588327,"The aim of the present study is to determine whether blood pressure reduction can be achieved by using a ""capture approach"" in which patients are given several different antihypersive drugs. In this paper, we examine the effect of antagonizing agents on stroke and mortality in elderly patients who have isolated stolic hypotension. We conclude that treatment with an anotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor reduces the frequency of total stroke but does not increase the risk of nonfatality or death. This paper also discusses other methods of preventing stroke in older adults. A Swedish trial in Old Patients With Hypertension has been used to compare the benefits of three beta blockers and one triuretic against two diurets. The results of this trial were as follows: 1) there was no significant relation between death nor stroke with body mass index in the placebo-controlled group; 2) there had no association between fatal and stroke events; and 3) there did not seem to be any relationship between die or stroke at all. These studies suggest that hypertension may be associated with increased risk for morbidity because it is more likely to lead to heart failure than to cause such complications. Antihypensive therapy seems to reduce the risks of stroke even though it increases the severity of disease. However, these studies do not provide clear evidence regarding the efficacies of either type of drug. For example, they show that vasodipine improves left ventricular functiosm when compared to standard treatments. They also demonstrate that age and gender influence blood flow."
27599725,"In this paper, we describe the results of an open-cohort study on 1703 patients with conventional heart failure who were followed for at least a year. We use hazard-ranking methods to predict risk of stroke in patients without previous stroke or transience of ischaemia and compare the performance of the Risk Score with the score obtained from the Framkins Stroke Score in the free population. Atrium fibrillation has been established amongst the general population as an independent prediction of long- term mortality after acutemyocardialinfa crt ison. However, it is less well understood across the entire spectrum of acute chest syndromes. The Japanese cardiac registry of Heart failure in Cardiology was examined in this study. It included 3,393 subjects with ST-Segment Elevation MyoCardal in Fa r Ct Ion; 755 with St-Elevation myocartal infaculation, 1942 with High-risk Non-ST-elevated elevation ACS."" A total of 1,304 patients had newly-onset aff and 387 had previously AF. This report describes the association between atrial fillation and death in Japan. Although there is no specific cause of death, anticoagulant treatment may improve early and midterm outcome after concomital artery bypass surgery. Antithrombotic therapy is associated with improved outcomes in these patients. Preventive atary fibrilation is one of several common arrhythmics that are frequently encountered in elderly patients receiving prosthetic valve replacement. There is little information about the relationship between new-time occurrence and major cardiovascular events. These include: sudden cardiac death -- increased mortality rate -- all causes -- progressive mechanical failure -- and other complications. Mortality rates vary according to age, severity of disease, and duration of followup."
30985692,"In this paper, we describe a novel treatment for patients with an acute spondiness that involves the combination of cyclooxygenasese-2 and etoricotinase-b blocker. This new therapy is shown to be effective in relieving pain in patients who have active axial symptoms. The main outcome measures are time weightedase average change from spine pain intensity. A subset of patients were randomly assigned to receive either short-term or overnight escorts. After two weeks, 22 patients received 105mg/dday of epicotoxib. On the basis of their response, they were divided into two groups: one group was treated with 80mcg per day; the other group had been given only 180 mg daily. They were then followed for six weeks until they reached complete response."
29466366,"This paper describes a new restorative technology that can be used to improve the performance of composites in the long term. It compares two different types of resins, one low shrinkage and one methacrylates-based, in class I and II cavities. The results show that both are less effective than other materials in terms of improving the patient's comfort. In addition, it shows that this new type of material may be more cost effective over time."
28095788,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to improving physician compliance with routine preventive care by using an inexpensive system of reminders. They compare two approaches: 1) alerting and 2) decision support. The first trial is designed to improve practice facilitation in primary care for older people who are at high risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, breast andceremonial lesions. This intervention is based on self-assessed health risk appraisers that are used to assess patient's response to prompting them to attend regular checkups or to receive immunisations. A second trial was conducted to evaluate the use of incentived telephone calls to increase blood pressure reading among patients without insurance. It was found that these practices were better able to control their patients' uptake of preventative care services than they were before."
18491999,"A telephony case management intervention is shown to improve the quality of life in patients with acute heart failure. In this trial, we assess the effects of two months of regular exercise on total working capacity and health-respective qualityof life. Within each group, TWC improvements with Host-CR and home-based treatment. The effect of exercise training reduces symptoms of chronic chest failure; however, which exercise intensities yield maximal beneficial adaptations is controversial. Furthermore, the rate of advanced age has been reported: 88 p.m. and 49 th % of subjects with a initial diagnosis of Chronic Heart failure are older than 70 years. This study compares training programs with mode versus high activity intensity with regards to variable associated with Cardiofoic function and proglossis in those with Postinfa Rct Ion Heart Failure. Selfefficacy was found to be an effective factor in improving exercise capacity in post-MyoCardal infaculation. However, studies have not yet established whether exercisetraining can improve left ventricular remodeling or affects functional status in these patients. These studies also examine changes in local expression of inflammation and endothelaial dysfunction. They conclude that physical training may help restore normal physiologic functions in people with chronic heart failing."

The aim of the study is to compare the pain and severity of patients using either arm or forearm toursniquetes. We examine the patient's pain at first, second, third, and sixth weeks after surgery. A significant difference in pain scores between the two groups was noted in the VAS Score. This study uses an army-specific training regimen to assess the effect of different types of trauma training on quadricep muscles. It also determines whether the use of these new devices can be used to improve the performance of military medics."
26788520,"In this paper, Dru Yoga is used as a model for the effects of meditation on sleep, mood, anxiety, and sympathetic activity in elderly women with Restless Legs Syndrome. The results suggest that meditation may be an effective treatment for older women who suffer from RLS because it reduces blood flow to prefrontal cortex and cerebellar regions. This study also shows that dopamine releases during relaxation are associated with reduced brain GABA level. Type 2 Diabetes is primarily caused by rapid growth in population in Asia, particularly among Caucasians. A recent study suggests that depression increases mortality in patients with Type 1 diabetes. Although there has been conflicting evidence concerning the utility of self-management and stress management training, several studies have suggested that such approaches can be cost-effective. However, many studies indicate that these methods do not work. These studies furthermore examine the effect of yoga on various aspects of mental health, including sleep disturbances, psychological well-being, fatigue, hypertension, autonomic function, heart rate variability, etc."

28398987,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective observational study of elderly patients in an ICU in France. We define frailtiness as meeting three to five of five established definitions for frailety: 1) physical activity, 2) grip strength, 3) involuntarous weight loss, and 4) exhaustion. The patient population was divided into two groups: those who met only one or two of the five defined characteristics; and those with no more than one of these characteristics. After 5 years, our study determines whether the 7- point Clinical Frailtesty Scale can predict death or require for entry into care. Brain Snack: Many studies have looked at how older people's brain function is related to their gait speed over time. This study compares the effects of exercise on older adults with heart failure. A multi-centre, single-center, outpatient trial has been conducted in Australia to identify which patients benefit most from exercise. Heart failure patients are treated according to severity of their ""flicildy profile"" -- that is, they lose weight, gain sedentry behavior, slow gaits speed, poor health, etc."
16117815,"In this paper, we describe the effects of three-month treatment of 13 healthy men with low or borderly low serum total testosterone levels. The effect of T therapy is primarily on bone mineral densities and quality oflife in older men. We also examine the impact of transdermally-tortured patches on muscle mass, body weight, and health-related qualities of life in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Men with lower blood test levels are more likely to benefit from longer-term treatments than those with higher levels because they tend to have greater resistance to disease. A recent study suggests that anabolic testing may be useful for improving strength and endurance in elderly men who have low bloodtest levels but do not show any significant changes in their overall health."

The effects of twelve wk' of exercises training using weight bearing vests were evaluated, in postmenomepausal females aged 30 to 50 years who were living at the community. They were assigned four categories: ""who had no falls""; those who had only one fall without severe injury or two or more falling without serious injury; and those whom had at least an injury causing serious damage. This study is designed to determine whether permanent lifestyle changes might result from physical activities and whether health could be affected by this changes. Walking has been shown to improve bone mineral density, aerobic fitness, muscle strength, and balance in older women. A home-based program of strength andbalance training consisting solely of walking results in improved performance in psychological socation than that of control groups. In addition, there are no significant differences in quality of life between the control group and the intervention group. To examine the relationship between physical activity for the risk of fractured bones among elderly women, including decline in functional capacity, blood pressure, lipoprotein concentrations, etc. These studies provide evidence that exercise can reduce the risks of falls.

After six and 12 months, meanfasting pulse glucose and haemolin A1c levels were reduced with the intervention groups compared with control groups. In addition, patients' satisfaction with their pharmacist was higher in those who received an extended pharmacist service. This study also focuses on patient involvement in the selection of antihysteric agents. Physicians use decision aids during the trial as well as educational pamphlets for each patient. Nurses education using phone calls results in reducing bloodglucosity in patients withtype 2 diabetes. An educational intervention that uses both the  cell phone and the web to provide telemedicine information regarding blood sugar levels was studied in Texas- Mexico border. It was found that Mexican American nurses had improved self-care behavior in type 2diatribes by increasing selfefficacy toward managing disease."

In this study, we examine the effect of interferon therapy on blood levels of 25hydroxyvitaminD. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence for the efficacy of IVD in multiple comatose patients but that interventional trials are not necessary. A prospective case-control trial was conducted among more than seven million US military men who had serum sample samples stored in the department of defense serum repository. The results showed that patients receiving either high dosage or low-dosage were associated with increased risk of Postpartum Multiple Sclerosis Relapses.

16983542,"In this double blinded, well-controlled trial, the efficacious and safety of both haloperidone and lithium Carbonate were examined in children aged 5.3 to 12.9 who had diagnoses for conduct disorder. Both drugs were found to have significant effects on behavior. Although both medicines were clinically effective, they often caused untoward changes. The results of this study indicate that hyperactivity is associated with criminality in adulthood. Children with conduct disorders are more likely to be arrested than children without such conditions. This study also examines the association between attention deficit disorder and hyperactiveness in childhood and adults. It was concluded that ""attention deficit disorder"" could not be improved by stimulant treatment. However, it was proposed that methylphini date would be superior to placebo as a treatment for children with conducting disorder because it showed greater reduction in aggressiveness over time. A second study investigated the effect of molindone on aggression in outpatient children. After examining the performance of two different types of drug therapy in patients with disturbances of behavior, we conclude that divalprox is as effective as motinone in treating these problems.

We assess the pain experienced after root canal therapy and compare it to that of other patients. This is an important issue because many studies have shown that there is no difference in the quality of lives among patients who receive both types of treatment. For example, one study showed that patients were more satisfied when they had received single tooth implant treatment than those who had been treated with two-tooth prostheses. Another study was designed to assess patient satisfaction by comparing the severity of pain during post-obitturation pain. The mean pain score was 0.8 for patients with only one tooth; 78.9% of them did not experience any pain at all.

In contrast, the control group loses only 28.15 pounds after 2 years. Although 40 percent of US women are currently tryingto lose weight, there is no association between intentionally lost weight and long-term health. This study uses matched controls from 43,4757 overweight females who completed 'questionnaire' about their weight change direction, amount, time interval, or intentionality'. A battery of general and study-specific self assessment instruments or serotonine was used tocharacterize health-related qualities of life in subjects with severely obesity; the efficacy for three gastric restrictive surgery were compared among 304 morbidly Obessive subjects.

28024276,"The purpose of the study is to determine whether a diet-and physical activity intervention can reduce blood glucose, insulin resistance, and body weight in people over age 50. This will be performed for six months and then followed up for twelve months. Since the Diabetes Prevention program has demonstrated that lifestyle changes can prevent Type 2 diabetes by 57 %, several studies now have translated this program into public health friendly contexts. In addition, many studies have examined the effect of an extended lifestyle change on fastingbloodglucosal concentrations as well as other risk factors such as body mass index, blood pressure, haemologlobin, lipoproteincholesterol, etc. These studies are not yet published. A group-based disease control trial was conducted in which overweight adults were assigned either 'control group' or one of two groups: 1) ""diet alone"" or 2) ""exercise plus exercise""; they were randomly assigned between these groups. They lost more weight than their controls at six month intervals but improved their scores on the modified physical performance test. Another study was carried out whereby overweight women were divided into three groups according to their body size. One group was assigned to high-fat, low-fibrie diets while the other was selected from conventional food sources. It was found that both groups lost significantly greater weight during the first year of followup after weight loss. Other studies investigated the efficability of different types of fat reduction strategies with respect to cardiovascular disease. For example, we studied men who had excessively high levels of body fat and reduced their waist circumference. We also looked at the effects of water exercises on heart function."

We conclude that early introduction of egg will not reduce the risk for egg allergy in children at high risk of allergic diseases. This study is a prospective, population-based cohort study designed to determine whether there are any differences in the prevalence of cow's milk or soy allergy among mothers who have previously reported their breastfed child as well as those who report their own consumption of these foods."
27100114,"This study focuses on the effects of eccentric exercises on muscle damage and injury in humans. It is concluded that eccentric exercise can be used as a preventative measure for delayed-onset soreness, but it is not proven to be as effective as other forms of exercise. The authors present several different approaches to treating muscles after injury: 1) monophasic electrical stimulation; 2) high-force concentric eccentric activity; and 3) low-volume familiarization. These studies aim to determine whether these treatments will reduce the severity of muscle injuries caused by repeated eccentric activities. In this paper, we examine changes in indirect measures of Muscle damage after an endurance exercise with maximal eccentric actions. We conclude that there is no significant change in markers of muscular damage following eccentric exertions. Acuponment has been proposed to improve recovery from fatigued muscles. However, many studies have suggested that antioxidants may also protect against such damaging results."

This technique shows significant improvement in the outcome when compared to measuring rsection techniques. In 99 patient-specific knee replacements, 105 were revised by two surgeonses using single revision total Kneearthroplasty systems. A retrospective observational review of joint lines position prior and after revulsion knee arthrosis was made, and comparisons were made with the jointline position before and during revision surgery.

The diet/probiol group has a lower risk of elevated blood glucose than the control group, but no reports have yet been made regarding the effects of this type of food on blood-lipid profiles in patients with Type 2 Diabetes mellitateus. In this study, we investigated the effect of consumption of Probiotic Lactobacterus acidophilous NCFM on Insulin Sensibility and its inflammatory response in subjects with impaired or normal insulin sensitivity. We also examined the efficacy of an anti-oxidative agent, LacTobacillus glutaricus BNR17, on elderly people. This study used 61 volunteers who were aged between 50 and 60 years. They were divided into two groups: one group received proliferating strains from human breastmilk; the other group was assigned to consume only prebiotic fibers. After six weeks, they were given three different doses of each substance. Both groups had significant reductions in total cholesterol, trigglyceride, LDL, and VDL. These results suggest that these changes may be due to the presence of procrites such as Lactopacilus delBrueckii Subsp. Bulgarus 88481."
22161373,"This paper describes a trial of parent training in children who are at risk of behavior problems. In this trial, parents were assigned to different treatment conditions and their effects on child behavior were examined. The results showed that the first treatment was more effective than the second. Parents were also less likely to be depressed or anxious after receiving the intervention. However, there was no difference in the severity of the disorder between the two groups. A study was conducted with 50 children with ADHD aged 8 to 12 years. They were divided into four groups: one group was given methylmethi date alone; another was sent to an extended parent-child relationship program; and the third group consisted of self-control training. After three years, 485 subjects had completed the treatment. There was neither significant change in either group's symptoms nor changes in other measures of social functioning. Both groups improved significantly over time. Although both groups did not improve parental behavior, they did improve school performance. Another study is presented whereby parents received ""friendship coaching"" for their kids with attention-deprived hyperactivity disorder. It was found that these practices could improve communication between adults who cared for children."
23840373,"In this chapter, the authors discuss the effect of high-doses of 25-Hysteriamin D on reducing the risk of death from pneumonia in patients with low birth weight. They conclude that it is necessary to further investigate whether or not higher doses can reduce the severity of acute respiratory tract infections in children with vitaminD deficiencies. A double blinded, placebo-control trial was conducted at a large government hospital in India to evaluate the efficacy of daily amounts of 1,500 mg of vitamin D as an anti-infection preventive measure. The results suggest that increased levels of 25,hydroxyvitamin C are associated with elevated risks of infection in infants with antibody disease. Furthermore, studies have suggested that serum levels may be inversely related to acute lung infections. Therefore, there is need for more controlled trials of these effects. For example, one study suggests that blood levels could be reduced by adding 1,000 IU of Vitamin D every two months. Another study reports that immune responses were improved after six months of addition of 1,000 and 3,000 ug. This paper also discusses the use of ""cholecalcifyrol,"" the major active metabolites of vitamins D, as phosphorus modulators of immune cell function."

32194129,"In this paper, we examine a large population of United States adults and find no significant association between psychediuses and mental health. After adjustment for sociodemography, other drug uses and childhood depression,we found no significance in the association with lifetime use or increased likelihood of serious psychological distress,mental health treatment, suicidasal thoughts, suicide attempt, depressionand anxiety. We conclude that there is little evidence to link psycelic use to mental illness. A double blind, r-omized, active placebo controlled pilot study was performed to examine safe and efficacious of lystergic acid diethetylamide-asanity in 12 patients who had anxiety associated with death. The results were reported by the State-Testi Anxiety Survey as the primary endpoint. This report also reports on the safety andefficacy of an open-labeled trial of ""psislocybin"" for treatment-restrained major depression. Twenty patients received two or three doses of it in addition to Cognitive Behavior Therapy and therapy session devoted to pre-treatment preparations. Abstenance did not increase dramatically after the first four weeks of treatment; but increased significantly upon p1silocjbin administration. Rational: Although many lines of evidence seem to suggest classic halluciinogens have medically relevant effects when alcohol and drug dependence are involved, little scientific evidence has been conducted on how these agents can induce personality changes. These studies involve hypnotism and spiritual practice. There is only one single-blind proof-ofconcept study reporting the acute effects of highdoses at meditative levels. It is concluded that hepatically induced positive changes in well being among healthy volunteers. Psitlocrybin may occasion mystical type experiences with participantattributed increases in Well-Being. However, few studies have examined enduring change in traits."
25972247,"In this study, the effects of dexmetomidine on cats are compared. The effect of bupronorphin in cats is a mixed-effect. It is used to treat dogs and cats with pain from Ostearthritis. Cats are divided into four groups according to their severity of disease. One group receives buprenol at 10 g/kg or 20 mg per cat; the other two groups receive buprinonormine at 0.5 mm/kg or 0.8 mg/Kg. After anesthesia, cats undergo soft tissue surgery. Postoperative pain and swelling were assessed at three, eight and 22 hours after recovery from Anesthesia using numerical Rating scales for pain, inflammation, and mobility. A transdermal patch was applied to each cat's skin before it was placed over the vein. This patch did not produce any significant change in its temperature during the testing period. Although there has been some mismatch between the signs of pain caused by osteoarthritis and the extent of discrepancies between these signs, no evidence suggests that they are all related. For example, joints affected by joint stiffness are more frequently affected than those associated with cartilage injuries. These studies relate to the use of mechanical thresholds as predictors of post-operation pain. They also compare the efficaciousness of methadine and butorannyl in treating cats suffering from acute locomotion disorders."

The results suggest that short-term pulmonary rehabilitation can be an effective treatment for patients who have severe and persistent pleiosemal disease. We conclude that these patients are particularly vulnerable to complications from long-course training."
32293469,"This paper focuses on the relationship between food and weight in patients with Type 2 diabetes. It uses a cross-sectional design to examine the relation between blood concentrations of lipopolitysacharide, an anti-diabetic agent, and body weight. The results suggest that resistance starch may be able to reduce the risk of developing type 2 disease by reducing the severity of the disease. In this study, we assess the efficacy of risistant starchite as compared to placebo in women with T2D. We conclude that restraining the use of resistant starches will improve the health of these patients."
26762372,"The present study assesses the protective effects on atherosis of carotenoidas and tocopherorols against myocaric infa-medial thickening. It is based on a cross sectional survey among adults aged between 25 and 1597 who were not free of cardiovascular disease. In this case, we examined blood samples from 392 women with confirmed MyoCardia or Streptomyctin Type I for 18 months. We also examined whether carotenides are associated with risk of heart disease in middle-age and elderly women. This was nested by case-control studies whereby patients were divided into two groups: those with higher levels of alphatocotherol and those that had lower levels. These subjects were then followed for 12 years until they reached age 55. They were further studied in an attempt to determine the effect of different carogenoids on the severity of coronary disease as well as their association with other risk factors such as smoking and consumption of high-fat diets."
28723736,"In this study, we determine the concentrations of Cefazoliin and cenoxitin in wound tissue in 40 patients undergoing choecystetomies. All of the patients received cefacin sodium or cefoxitesin at the time they were on call or with anesthesia. The results indicate that cephalospoin is detectable in all wounds during the first two days of surgery. A prospect double blinded study compares a six-day regimen with 2 day prophylaxes among 200 patients who undergo prostheticval replacement. No cases are of endocartis during their follow-up period. Urinal tract infection develops more frequently than in the two-week regimen. We examine risk factors, use, efficacy, and efficiacy of propholactic antibiotics as preventive measures for surgical site infections in Thail hospitals. From July 1, 2003 to June 30, 2004, we conducted ten hospitals in Thailand and performed eight prospective studies using the national no socomial infection surveillance system. This study was designed to identify risk factor,use,and efficacity of Prophylactic Antimicrobials forSurgical site infection /Swi. To estimate relative risk estimates from predictors; we used logistically regression analysis to calculate relative risks for prediction of sensitivity. Preventative measures were calculated by unreliable multiple logistic regression."
22002191,"This study focuses on the use of non-intubated positive pressure ventilation in patients with acute respiratory failure after abdominal surgery. It is a prospective, open-label study designed to evaluate the effects of inspiratory force and breath stacking on lung function during major anecdote surgical procedures. In this paper, we report that deep breathing exercises are superior to no exercise at all in preventing postoperative pulmonary complications after coronary bypass grafted patients. We conclude that incentives for physical therapy may be more effective than conventional physiotherapists' methods in treating patients who have severe airflow limitation due to chest resection."
31921439,"In this study, we examine the effects of eight-week exercise training on aerobic fitness, roid and fat mass, blood lipid profiles, and risk factors for Type 2 diabetes in overweight and obesity subjects. The results show that high intensity interval exercises are more effective than moderate intensity continuous training in terms of improving body composition and endotolhelial function. We also find that all-exertional interval training is superior to moderate-straught endurance training because it produces greater improvements in heart rate and lipoprotein content. Furthermore, these studies suggest that vigorous exercise will be more beneficial in patients with chronic disease. This study uses a novel quality-assessment tool to assess the efficacy of high-entensity interval training as an intervention for improved health."
30301735,"In this study, we assess the efficability of a new topical glucamine patch on patients with shoulder Achilles tenditis. We conclude that it is superior to corticosterin in improving outcome for patients who have not received treatment for more than six weeks. A prospective cost-effectiveness study is performed to determine the burden of illness associated with pain in primary care in Sweden. All patients were included and treated according to their severity. The aim of the study was to compare the effects of two different types of therapy: 1) transdermal NTG or 2) eccentric training. This trial was designed to assess whether the use of Glycerine trinitate improved outcome in patients suffering from patellar disease. It was found that the effect of using GLYCryl tritrinitrate had been significant when compared to placebo. However, there was no difference in the patient satisfaction or pain scores during the sports trial."
24752440,"The purpose of the study is to determine whether an isocaloric, pre-term infant formula that was fed from birth through expected term would improve bone mineralization. In this study, we examine the effect on weight gain, leptenin, and blood sugar in preterm premature infants. Preterm babies are frequently given large doses of food during their first three months of life but have been shown reduced growth throughout early childhood. A large efficacious and safety trial has been performed to evaluate whether feeding into the first nine months after birth will reduce growth deficits while improving neurodevelopment without any adverse safety outcomes. This study compares changes in bone strength and mineral content in two groups of very low-birth-women. Sixteen pregnancy-discharged infant girls were assigned to exercise or control groups. After eight weeks of active range-ofmotion exercise, they showed significant increases in body mass and height. They also found that there was no difference in gender, birth weight, or gestation age when compared with controls. To further investigate whether physical activity could prevent the formation of osteoporesis of prematism, several studies were conducted. One study examined the effects of a series of exercises on bone turnover in post-menopause women. Two years of vigorous exercise followed by calcium supplementation resulted in greater bone Mineralization in both groups"
31731772,"The effects of a fiber-rich breakfast on weight loss and body composition are examined in this study. In the first two weeks, whole grain consumption is associated with reduced body weight but not long-term changes in body mass. This study examines the association between single nucleotides in the Fto gene with an anthropometric test in Iranian aging males. It was found that men who consumed more refined grains consistently grew less than those who did not consume them. A further study was performed to determine whether the effect of soy or cow's milk on fat loss was greater than that of either group. Women were divided into four groups: 1) exercise; 2) isoflavene; 3) exercise and placebo; and 4) exercise alone. After six months, both groups completed an exercise program at the final result of which cardiovascular risk factors were calculated. Thus, we conclude that it is necessary to investigate whether these three different sources of food can improve body size and health in overweight and obesity women."
29219090,"The effects of omization and physical activity on children's bone mineral content were examined in this study. Children showed greater changes in their gross motor, fine motor activities, and arm bone area after 12 months than they did before. This was due to the fact that there were no differences between body mass-index and size at all. In addition, it was found that increases from 6 to 24 months are greater in the Gross motor group: bone loading; large muscle exercises; art and crafts program; and total body. A comparison is made between these two groups of children with different levels of calcium consumption. For example, infants who received only physical care but not emotional support had more growth and development than those who only got physical exercise."
29102433,"The aim of this study is to compare the effect of daily consumption of vitamin D, or a combination of 1,500 IU of alpha-D and calcium fortified Yogurt drink on blood glucose in subjects with Type 2 diabetes. After ninety subjects were assigned to consume plain Greek yogurt drink, containing no Vitamin D or 150 mg Cao/250 molL, respectively, at 27 week gestation, we examined the effects of prenatal vitamins on childhood whheezing. MethodsWe r and Omized 180 pregnant women At 27 weeks gestations to either novitamin D ; 800 iu ergocaliferol Daily until delivery Or singleoral bolus Of 200,000 IOcholecalcifyelor. In an ethnically clustered, double blind controlled trials, patients were divided into three groups: group A received 1,000 ions per day; group B received 5,000 ivites per month; and group C received 500 IV erygocalcifels daily. This study was designed to examine whether high doses of 25HhD can prevent heart failure in patients with low levels of it. It was found that lower levels are associated with reduced right venous function. Furthermore, studies suggest that increased amounts of certain nutrients may be beneficial because they have been associated by other diseases. Therefore, these studies recommend that people should receive sufficient amount of adequate supply of both essential and non-essential nutrients."
30237020,"In this paper, we describe the efficaciousness and safety of a novel treatment regimen for Peyrisone's disease. We first examine the effect of verapamemil on patients with peyronie-disease. The results show that there is significant improvement in the size of the plaque before and after treatments. A second study compares transdermal electricmotive administration to intralesional needle-pricking therapy for treating peironic diseases. This trial uses tionophoresis as an alternative to surgery because it does not involve penile deformedness. After two months, all patients are pain-free except for one patient who has severe disfigurement."
29043156,"Children with an extended severity of the disorder are increasingly being included in general school classrooms as they attempt to improve social involvement. In this paper, Anderson focuses on the relationships between children with and non-sensual peers across three grade levels. Although only 48.1 percent of students with ASD participate in social networks within their class, there is a significant difference in the frequency of friendships between these groups. This study also examines the extent that clinical and Demographic characteristics predict outcome for children who have an autistic spectrum disorder. The results suggest that treatment of such children may be more successful than other treatments."
22161422,"In this paper, we examine the effect of behavior modification on children with attention deficit hyperactivité disorder. The effects are described in terms of both short-term and long- term treatment. We conclude that a combination of medication and behaviormodification is more effective than either alone or combined treatment because it improves social skills and reduces the risk of side effects. This paper also discusses several other important issues: 1) how to assess the quality of evidence in studies; 2) whether observational or rand-omized trial results differ significantly; and 3) whether patients receive better outcomes after two years of treatment than they did before. Although many trials fail to conceal allocation, blinding, or loss of follow-up, most studies do not. However, there are some exceptions -- for example, when an intervention does not result in improvement over two months, such as using behavior modification instead of medicine."
31729817,"This study focuses on fall prevention in older women. In this paper, we investigate the effect of vitamin D1 on muscle function and compare it to other measures such as strength and balance. We conclude that falls are a riskfactor for fractures because they involve both physical and mental changes. Aim: To determine the effects with alfacalcol on muscles strength after back-extensor exercises in elderly women who have amenorrehea. Methods: The patients were divided into four groups; the first group was treated with calcium 600mg/d or 800 IU per day while the second group received only placebo. Results: No significant difference in demographic data between these two groups. Furthermore, there was no significant change in bone mineral dentition, height, weight, or muscle strength at baseline and follow-up. These results suggest that exercise is an effective strategy for preventing falls."
31541679,"In this paper, we describe the efficacy and safety of pulvinar vein antral isolated in patients with atrial fistias. It is reported that it is safe and effective to ablate these patients without adverse response. Atrial thrombs are common in adult congenital hearts. Acute takycardia occurs in about one-third of all patients who have congested heart disease."
17253498,"The effect of growth-hormone therapy on body proportion in girls with a rare form of Turner Syndrome is described. In this study, 68 previously unstreated girls were assigned to one group of three dosage regimens: group A, 4 iu/m2 daily; group B, first year 4, and thereafter 6 or 8 IU perm 2 x day; groups C, second year 6, and third year 8, respectively. To evaluate the effect that growth hormone treatment has on height velocity, we assess the effects of treatment on adult height during childhood. After two years of follow-up, all subjects receive either hg alone or combination of ox plus rolone. Girls with Turner syndrome are treated for 3 months with either human growth Hortense or recombineant human HGH. When they reach their final height, however, they do not show any change in other aspects of their health."
17705840,"In this paper, the authors describe a series of controlled trials designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of risperdone in treating patients with acute Bipolar I disorder. The main efficacy test was change from base to endpoint on the Young-Mania Rating scale. A significant reduction in total score is observed at end point for patients receiving relapse therapy. Although many studies have attempted to estimate the effect of treatment in terms of pain relief, little evidence has been published that confirms these results."
31066022,"This study aims to investigate the effects of a single-leg balance task on postural control over injured and noninjured ankles. The results indicate that anteropostor sway is significantly reduced in injured legs, but area is not significantly affected. Acuponoration is common after ACL injuries and there is little evidence for its association with return to sport. Postural controls are important for patients with low back pain who do not participate in sports. In this study, we examine the effect of two-handed or double-limb balance tasks on posture while recovering from ankle instability. We find that subjects with only one leg lose more than those with both legs."
28427968,"The purpose of this study is to determine the frequency and severity of strokes among patients with atrium fibrillation. Specifically, we aim to investigate the association between atrial fibrillation and stroke risk in China. We examine the use of anticoagulants in Chinese patients who have paroxysmal atheism as a riskfactor for stroke. In addition, there is little evidence that hyperuricence can predict stroke or cause fatal events in these patients."
28699771,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of patient choice to determine whether or not patients should receive an urgent appendicide in children. The results suggest that it is safe and cost-effective for children to receive both surgical and non-operative treatment. Anderson concludes by stating that although many patients receive conventional treatment for acute appenicitis, there is little evidence that surgery can be used to treat these patients. He furthermore suggests that some patients who have no known complications may have better outcomes after receiving antibiotic therapy."
25809923,"A rand-omized, double- blinded pilot study is designed to evaluate the effect of six months treatment with Leuprolide on pain and satisfaction in women with Endometriasis. The mean change in pain scores from baseline to post-treatment in the three-month depot arm or from 2.1 to 0.7 compared with the monthly depot arms was not statistically significant. Serum LH and 17 Beta-OestradioL concentrations were suppressing at twelve and 24 weeks without any differences between the two groups. In this study, patients who had laparoscopic diagnoses of pelvic disease were randomized to either receive either leurolde acetate 3mg daily or goselerelin 1m daily for 6 months. This trial compares efficacy as well as side effects of Gabapentiin, amitaptyline, and their combined in females with chronic pelvicac pain. Goserelil has been shown to be more effective than MPA in alleviating signs and symptoms while improving sexual functioning. Both methods have improved the quality of life among women suffering from all stages of epitheliositis after conservative surgery. These studies are divided into four sub-study groups: 1) patient preference cohort; 2) pre-menopauses; 3) endometry-related pain; and 4) acupuncture. All subjects were assigned to one group because they had no somatic causes of their pain but were given attention to other causes including psychological disturbances. Finally, we conclude that written emotional disclosure can be an effective stress management intervention when it is used to treat painful menstrual problems."
31189669,"Aims contact force catheters provide needle-tissue information to improve outcomes of pulmonary vein isolated. In this study, we compare efficiency, safety, andefficacy of ""Cloese""-guided pepsonal vein isolation to conventional peptonal ablation with the use of an electric current. The results are compared to 50 patients who had previously undergone convescible pepping into either CB-g2-PVI or Conv-CF. This study is a follow-up of our previous studies on early relapse rates of atrium fibrillation following second generation cryoballon or radiofrequency current abclusion for pulmonary leg isolation. We also examine the efficaciousness of electrode-total tissue contact forces in treating paroxysmatrial atrial fibrilation."
25268297,"A prospective, observational study evaluating the efficability of buspiron in treating patients with panic disorders is performed. The results indicate that it is more effective than placebo in improving symptoms in patients who have been previously treated with other anxiety-provoking drugs. In addition, there is evidence that this form of treatment does not lead to tolerance or addiction."
31685858,"This paper describes a double blind, placebo-control study in which the effects of methylphini date on children with low intelligence were compared to those of other stimulants. The results showed that both teachers and parents reported improved performance on several measures of attention, overactivity, and conduct problem. In addition, they found no significant differences between the doses used for each child. A doubleblind, crossover study was performed in 90 children who received the identical dose of MPH as in three independent studies. Both teachers or parents rated their children consistently as having improved on subassess assessing behavior problems. There were relative few significant drugs by condition; however, when the highest fen fluramine dose produced more behavior comply but apparently at ""the cost of efficiency"". Brain Snack: Previous studies have shown short term efficacy from pharmacotherapies but no longer than four months. Meta-Another study examined the effect of treatment on patients with learning and/or behavior disorder. Children with hyperkinetic disorders were assigned to two different treatment regimens. One group received dextrouamphetam, 0.5mg/kg daily, while the other divided into two groups treated with either st or ardent community care. These studies did not show any significant changes in outcome scores. However, there were significant improvements in parent and teacher satisfaction with both treatments. BCGOBUND Prior studies had demonstrated the quick-termefficacy of medication and behavior therapyfor attention-defect/hyperactivité disorder but now it is not long-lived."
28886707,"Caffeine increases blood pressure, but the risk of Type 2 diabetes is uncertain. The consumption of artificial sweetened beverages has also been associated with increased risks of type 2 disease in the United States. In this study, we examine the effects on appetite and body weight in a group of children from 4 to 11 years old who are not overweight. We compare the effect of sugar-sugarened drinks on hunger and physical activity in normal-sized women. A comparison of drinking water with aspartume reduces fasting bloodglucose levels while increasing body fat. This study investigates the association between diet soda and long- term waist circumference change in an African American population. It was previously reported that full-calorie sweetnerers such as sucrose or carbonated artificialsweeteners have been implicated in excessive weight gain. However, recent studies have suggested that these chemicals may be harmful for health. These studies suggest that replacing sugary soft drinks with non-food sweetener can lead to weight loss."
22710280,"This paper focuses on the effects of different levels of adherence to the improved recovery after surgery on outcome following major surgery. It is a prospective, single-centre cohort study in which all patients are treated with the same care and follow the exact same procedure for six to 11 days. The aim of the study is to review the evidence for improving post-surgery care in patients who have undergone colorectric surgery as well as to compare it with conventional sedentary care. In particular, this study examines the efficacy of an eras protocol for fast-track wound management in colonial resection patients. Although there is some consternation over the use of rapid-tracking anaesthesia in these patients, we conclude that it is possible to speed up the recovery process by administering morphine directly into the veins rather than via local analgesis."
24869750,"A parallel group study compares two antihypersive agents, the combination of diuretic/HCTZ and a new indolamine-like drug, captopriL. The results indicate that both drugs produce significant reductions in blood force during the first four weeks of each treatment. In addition, all patients show no side effects except for one transient change of taste in capstopriml. Blood pressure is reduced in all groups but the mean percent change from baseline is highly significant at eight weeks. Diuretics have been recommended as first line agents for treating hypertension; however, there are few studies to confirm this claim. These include an investigation of the effect of amlofdipine, chlorhalidone, and placebo on mild or moderate essential hyper tension. This study was aimed at reducing the 5 year combined epidemic of fatal and unfatal strokes by comparing the efficaciousness and safety of different antihystertensive treatments. It showed that most elderly subjects could be treated successfully with chlorthalilidene 12.5mg per day. However, some patients were not able to achieve their desired blood pressure reduction without changing their left ventricular masses. Furthermore, other factors may be responsible for reversional of left heart hypertrophy. Antihypertinesives can be more effective when they are combined with other medicines. For example, perindopurl has shown superiority in preventing calcium stone occurrences than any other agent."
26659821,"In this paper, Seuss focuses on the use of ""consumer-orientedefficacy assessment"" in clinical trials to assess changes in chief complaints and consumer requests. He uses a gold-standard search filter to identify studies that have been published in the medical literature that relate to measures of health-related quality of life. The results suggest that children receiving early intervention displayed significantly higher development ages and make more gains in adapting skills than children who received regular treatment. This study compares the effectiveness of an early childhood intervention program with one that is routinely used in school settings for children with severe or mild intellectual disability. It finds that both groups are better able to cope with their own symptoms while improving their overall well-being."
28235776,"This study focuses on the use of text messages to improve lifestyle change in people with acute myosmia. It is a first attempt at using mixed-methods approaches to develop an intervention that will reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease for patients who receive repeated reminders about eating, physical activity, and smoking. A total population of 720 men with coronary chest disease will be included in this study. In addition, the treatment group will receive weekly texts that provide information, motivation, support to stop smoking, healthy diets or exercise. These messages are expected to decrease the rate of death due to sudden changes in blood pressure after an acute Myocardial Infa Rct Ion."
29340748,"In this study, we examine the association between age and risk of complications after shoulder surgery in patients with a high-risk group. We also examine how long it takes to recover from deep wounds after total shoulder replacement. This study uses case-control analysis to determine whether an older age is more likely to experience complications than younger ones. The results indicate that older adults are less frequently involved in revisions for mechanical failure or reoperation. Furthermore, younger age has been found to be associated both with improved survival and with greater risks for thromboembolicities. Finally, our study compares the outcomes of shoulder arthropoplasty and reverse total knee rotatorplasty. It was concluded that the home use of gluconates cloth would be more effective than sterile soap and water on the preoperative levels of pathogens."
29935874,"This study focuses on the effect of mineral trioxine aggregate on pushout bond strength over different experiments. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy of three different mixing methods: 1) ultrasonic, 2) trituration, and 3) conventional methods. Each material was mixed according to manufacturers' instructions; after 7 days, root canal sections were prepared in 0.8-mm thick slices. These slices were subject to the push Out test. In this study, we compare the strength of two different cements, Biodentine MTA and Calcium Trioxide Aggregate, as root endfilling material. Both materials have significantly higher push-out bonds than the other group. Aims To assess the influence of retreatment upon the pressure out bond strengths of various root filling materials. Methods are described for preparation of 80 single-rootedmaxillary central tooth roots. After root section preparation using protaper rotid files, specimens were divided into six sub groups by the use of the finalirrigant regimen : G1, 17 %) EDTA, 7 %maleic acid, G3, 7% QMix, 2 p.m. peracetic Acid, PAA, 1 0% Saline. Thirty root dentinal samples were filled with each material except ProRoot which was filled only with CaCl2, an alkaline solution. Bond strength values were calculated under a universaltesting machine at 4 magnification. Results showed that the ""UA/EC"" and ""UM/PU"" groups had significantly better bond qualities than their other groups."
19902985,"In this study, we examine 28 untrained women with ovulatory and luteally adequacacy to determine the effect of exercise on menstrual disorder. The subjects were assigned to either weight loss or weight maintenance groups. Women in both groups showed marked changes in their blood sugar tolerance over time. They also showed no significant differences in the severity of Type 2 diabetes Mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance. We examined hypotheses regarding the disruption of LH Pulsatility by assayling blood samples drawn at 10 min intervals over 24, h from 9 young sedentarian, regularly Menstruating women upon days 8 - 9 / 10, or 10 of twicemenstruals after four days of vigorous exercise. To further investigate the role of energy availability in these conditions, Wuthering Heights performed supervised studies on eight adult female monkey model Macaca Faculcularis. These studies revealed that women who had irregular menarchal cycles may have an increased risk for heart disease and stroke. This study was based on 82,4039 female nurses whom provided information in Annex II on prior menstroal regularity at age 20 yr. It was concluded that there was no association between normalized male activity and subsequent cardiovascular events."
23160338,"In this study, we investigate the effect of an anti-appetitive statin on the risk of atrial fillation in patients with heart failure who are not in af. We conclude that it is important to use evidence from unpublished studies to determine whether or not statiss can be used as an effective preventative measure for atrium fiilation after coronary bypass surgery. A prospective observational study was performed by 4657 patients under Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting between November 1996 through June 2000 at seven centers located within seventeen countries. From calculating predicted risk factors and predictor variables, they identified to develop ""a comprehensive risk model"" which was assessed among 1564 patients. Atrial Fiillation After Cardiopulmonary Byput Following Coronary Artifice: This study aims to assess the effects of treatment with preopératin against atary fibrillations following elective cardinal ablation.

17210875,"This study focuses on the effects of weight loss in overweight patients. It is a mixed-effects study with two different diets, one low-fat and one high-carburohydrate, to examine the relationship between body weight and blood pressure. The results suggest that both strategies have positive effects on heart disease. In this paper, we describe the effect of an eight-week exercise program on changes in body mass index, body fatness, and other risk markers. We conclude that these changes are not associated with increased levels of Creactive Protein, but rather with changes related to increases in systemic inflammation."
29450937,"In this paper, the aim of this present study is to compare three root end-filling materials based on mineral trioxine aggregate and super Eba. The teeth were treated after 5 years with either MTA or BprRRM as root-ending filling materials.

23839768,"The effect of dipyridemole on the prevention of systemic thromboemia in patients with prometheus heart valves has been studied. In this study, the combination of warfari and aspirin is more effective than either agent alone in preventing a significant number of major bleeding events during the first year after prosthetic heartvalve replacement. A prospective open-label trial compares the safety andefficacy of two different regimens of anticoagulant therapy for patients who have undergone mechanical heart Valve Replacement. After three years, all patients are followed up for at least one year."
26691216,"This paper describes a novel approach to risk factor reduction in patients with acute coronary disease. It involves the use of an ""e-mail-to-the-patient's nurse"" who is trained to help patients change their habits and improve their health. The results of this trial are very similar to those of other trials, including total and cardiovascular death, sudden death; and fatal and no fatal reinfare ion. In contrast, the rehabilitation group has significantly lower mortality than the control group after three years of follow up. A second study investigates the effectiveness of self-management on top of normal care for people with heart failure. This study uses telemedicine to improve physical activity behavior among patients suffering from chronic atheroscomatose diseases such as myomyocardial arteriosis. Although there is some evidence that exercise can be used to reduce risk factors in these patients, it is not yet clear whether this intervention will work."
16625624,"The effect of high-calcium intake on bone mineral gain in young girls is outlined. In this paper, we examine the association between time-adoled childhood sports history and total body Bone mineral gains between ages 12, 18 years, and to peak bone mass at age 18. We also investigate the effect that daily calcium supplementation can have on children with precocity of puberty who are treated with gluconine. This study uses a case-control approach to determine whether drinking soft drinks or milk consumption increase fracture risk among children aged 9-16 years. A population-based case control study was used to assess the relationship between soft drink/milk consumption, physical activity, bone Mineral Density, Upper Arm Fractures; and upper arm fracture cases were studied for two years after treatment. Carbonated beverage has been reported increasing fracture risks in children but there is no agreement about how much Calcium Young Girls need foroptimum bone mineralsization. There is little agreement on what amount of calcium girls should be consumed during their early adulthood. For example, studies have shown an increase in bone material content in girls with ""precocious Puberties"" when they receive either 500mg Ca/d from carbonate or placebo. However, these studies do not show any significant change in height or weight as compared to those received by other girls. Although short-term studies suggest that long- term supplements may improve bone health, it is not yet known whether such effects persist after discontinuation. Short-lived studies indicate that cavalieral women lose bone during pregnancy because of loss of dairy products. Postmenarchal females begin to lose bones during lactation due to lack of adequate supply of breast milk. To prevent bone loss during Lactation, infants are given higher amounts of milk and more calcium. After birth, corticosterosteroid use plays an important part in protecting against fractures. Consuming too much of both food and water increases bone growth. Children's exercise regimens have been successful in preventing fracture before menarchel age. They have also demonstrated improved bone size and mineral content over time. These studies include several articles concerning the effects of diet on whole body bone composition. One article discusses the benefits of exercise in improving bone acquisition in patients with osteoporoseis. Two others describe the results of three different types of exercises: 1) moderate- impact exercise with orwithout calcium or 2) low-impact activities without adding cholecalif"
29188577,"This randomized, controlled trial is designed to determine whether a high intensity functional exercise program can improve balance, gaitability, and lowerlimb strength in elderly persons dependent on daily living. They are divided into two groups: intervention group, which includes 29 exercises over 3 months; control group consisting of 29 sessions over 2 months as well as an energy supplement immediately afterwards. Berg balance scale, self-pace and maximum gaits speed were followed up at three and 6 months after the exercises. The study uses factorial analysis to assess whether or not fti training can reduce self reported fear of falling in older adults. Fifty one individuals, 31 women, 20 men, mean age SD ) /84 yr old met frailness criteria and were assigned into different groups. In this study, fifty-one individuals were divided according to their severity of physical injury and they were given either immediate intervention or delayed intervention. A six-month multimodified training program was used to evaluate the effects of resistance exercise on postural control for older people. Thirteen experimental subjects were all balance imprisoned by slips. Although resistance exercises have been found to be beneficial during prefrail adulthood, it remains unclear how long these effects will last when they are followed by detraining. This study examines the effect of multicompartment training on musclepower output, muscle mass, body composition, performance, health status, risk of falls, etc. These studies provide evidence that exercise has some positive impact on certain physical determinantants and on other functional ability outcomes. It also provides evidence regarding the efficacy of milk fat gloule membrane treatment in community dwelling elderly Japanese women. Falling leads to severe health problems in the elderly but importantly contributesto morbidity, death, immobilities, hospitalization, early entry to Long-Term Care Facilities."
24798429,"A randomed controlled trial of pharmacists' intervention to reduce risk factor levels in patients who had undergone acute coronary disease was performed. At one-year followup, the patients improved their risk factors by an average of 76 percent. The highest proportion of those who achieved the goal were those with statins. In this study, we examine whether the improvement in riskfactors is maintained at 1 year after the initial intervention. We conclude that the ""choice of health options in prevention of cardiovascular events"" program has been shown to be effective and that it will be maintained for 4 years. This study compares the effectiveness of home-based cardiac Rehabilitation over a six month period on physical and mental health measures. It shows that there are no significant differences in patient satisfaction or quality of life between the two groups. For example, women received more counseling than men in the control group during the first five weeks after discharge. However, they did not show any difference in self-efficacy or change in other important measures such as blood pressure or exercise."
28462286,"Heart failure treatment is a hot issue in the medical community, but there are few studies that have examined the effects of daily weight tracking on heart failure patients. The effect of this program has not yet been studied; however, several other studies have reported that it improves quality of care and reduces readmissions within one year. In particular, these studies suggest that ""disease management programmes"" may be effective for patients with severe or chronic heart failing. A multidisciplinary disease management program can help to improve outcomes in patients who experience depressed symptoms. This study compares the effectiveness of an education-based telephone intervention against telemedicine alone. It was found that patient knowledge about their condition increased significantly in both groups. After two years, they were reexamined at three months' time to assess if improvements were maintained after receiving the intervention. Both groups had lower rate of unplanned admission or death during 12 to 18 month follow-up. However, all cause mortality and hospitalization were measured by echocardiogram. Although many physicians recommend routine care for congestive hearts failure, some evidence suggests that such care should be extended to older patients as well. These studies report that elderly patients receive more frequent home visits than usual care. They also report less out-ofhospital deaths and costs when compared to normal care group. There are no significant differences between the control group and the nurse-to-patient relationship."
24253135,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to post-pancreaticodectomy surgery. They use an easy-to-use device called Flotrac/Vigleo to evaluate improvements in patient outcomes by the duration and severity of their hospital stay. The patients are divided into either an improved hemodynamic monitoring groups or stand and ardmanagement groups according to their blood status. Postoperative pulmonary complications following coronary arteries bypassing grafts have not yet been studied. Preoperative anemia is treated with iron sucrose but has higher increases in haemolin levels than oral iron. This study compares surgical results and morbidity between the use ""a single drain"" and ""two-drainpost-anatomyal pulmonary dissections."" Acute thrombus formation is known to cause delayed discharge after colorecotal surgery; however, preoperative education can improve these conditions. Enteral feeds are now used frequently for nutrition after ecophageal disease. Although current opinion favors enteral feeding over parenterals, there is little evidence that early posturgical nutrition is superior to parentoral nutrition. For example, we report that naogastric tubes are more effective in resection because they do not involve tubularization. However, many surgeons practice using NG tubes instead of chest tubes. These studies aim to reduce the risk of infection during major surgery as well as to shorten the length of time in hospital. Epidural Analgesis provides continuous pain relief and may have benefits over parental opiate treatment. Goal-directed fluid administration seems to improve outcome at the beginning of surgery when commenced prior to surgery although it does not seem to be associated with any significant increase in mortality. Intravenous cedar irrigation is recommended for patients with severe wounds who require immediate drainage. There is some debate about whether epidral analgea is effective on the quality of life of patients awaiting elective bowel surgery due to its high risk for complications. Urination catheterization is also problematic since it causes urinary retention leading to delayed delivery of bladder needles. We investigate the efficaciousness of entering food before major open opsophagectomy. It is reported that jejunostodymy helps prevent nausea and vomiting while increasing muscle strength."
29517050,"This paper focuses on patients with atrium fibrillation who are not currently treated with antithrombotics. Although warfarin is the most effective treatment for these patients, there is little evidence of its safety or efficacy in this group. Percutaneous left-atrial appenage closure can be considered as an alternative to long-term regimens of OAC because of the risk of spontaneous intracranial bleeding. In this study, we examine the safety andefficacy of laa closed by single anti platelet therapy in subjects with previous spontaneous haemorrehage. We assess the long term outcomes of patients who do or do not restart anticoagulant therapy after such a procedure. A retrospective followup study was performed among all patients admitted to 13 Stroke centers in the registry of Canadian Stroke Network between July 3, 2003 and March 2008. Warfari is restarted frequently in hospital in patients aged 55 year old or older. The prognosis of stroke depends on preictal factors, including age, health habits, and blood pressure. After one year, only 96 patients were alive. Predicative risk factors include baseline characteristics, medical history, physical appearance, etc. These factors were used to predict whether or not they would result in stroke or other complications."
22708573,"This paper focuses on three methods of accountging for the effects of case manager services in tests of efficacy. First, it is argued that case managers should be treated as fixed factors; second, they should not be examined within the case management team; and third, each of the three approaches to accounting for service effects should also be used to account for cases manager effects. In this paper, Anderson discusses the latest developments in positive psychology, including books, meetings, courses, and conferences. The authors examine the effect of an exercise on drug treatment entries among injection drug use with and without anti-social personality disorder. They conclude that treating patients with a strength-based casemanagement intervention may improve their chances of entering treatment. Furthermore, these results support the need for ""formal case managing"" in providing community supports for people with serious mental illnesses. When comparing control conditions in which physicians, day treatment workers, or residential staff receive no treatment, the Strength's model was significantly more effective in meeting three specific community goals: increasing personal incomes, providing required social support, maintaining physical health, etc. These results are supported by the fact that both groups have similar increases in attending to primary therapy and medicine management over the period. However, when compared to controls, there is significant improvement in attendance at all three of these goals."
21464190,"In this paper, we describe the results of a large, well-respected early intervention for children with autistic spectrum disorder. We compare two groups of treatment: one group is delivered through an independent psychologist and the other is provided by community practitioners. The results show that both groups have significant improvements in intelligence, language, daily living skill, positive social behaviors, and standardized measures of well being. This study continues to advance our understanding of the effects of early childhood intervention on children's development. For example, it has been shown that early education can be used to help children develop their social communication skills."
31478020,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights focuses on the effects of public reporting and information-based practice on improving maternal health in developing countries. The aim is to reduce inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for patients with suspected upper respiratory tract infection at primary care. This study uses a clustered-rand-omized control trial to evaluate the effcacy of an eight-hour education program to improve general practitioners' behavior and communication skills. It also examines the effect of continuous quality improvement on mothers who have been started on long-term treatment of HIV. A nine-month training intervention was found to be more effective than usual care when compared to regular care provided by physicians. Pregnancies were followed up to two months after birth in three different districts of Malawi. Newborn disease is primarily caused by infections and pneumonia; however, there is little evidence for improved management of newborns in low- or middle- income countries because of lack of trained health workers. These issues are related to inadequate access to adequate medical care and poorer nutrition among children under 5 years of age. To address these challenges, the national Integrated Management Of Childhood Illity strategy has been developed. However, it does not provide sufficient support for mid-care workers to manage diseases like tuberculous disease and malaria. Poor nurses and pharmacists are still lacking in their knowledge about how to use evidence-base practices to treat patients."
32196906,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effect of resistance training on weight loss in patients who have undergone bariatic surgery. This study compares physical activity to pre-surgical exercise for improving body weight and risk markers after gastric by-expansion therapy. Anderson concludes that ""pre- surgical exercise training"" can improve these outcomes even further. He also discusses the use of lifestyle changes such as diet control and self-esteem to reduce the risk of weight regain. The results of this study suggest that behavior change is associated with improved weight Loss."
24628781,"In this study, we examine the effects of statins on erectil function in men with moderate to severe ED. We find that silldenafil does not improve oesthelial function but rather restores it by reducing blood levels. This is an important finding since many men have failed to respond adequately to either treatment. Furthermore, there is little evidence that atorvastapin or quinpapril can be used as an effective treatment for patients with mild to moderate ear-disease."
25601182,"This study focuses on the effects of neighborhood walking on older adults' quality of life. It is a multi-level trial with five hundred eighty two senior residents in the northeast Metropolitan area of Portfland and, Oregon, who are eligible for participation. The purpose was to examine whether walking and B-supplementation affects qualityof life in community-dewling adults with mild mental impairment. In this study, 49 patients with FM were randomed to either moderate-to high intensity Nordic Walking or supervised low intensity walking. They were then divided into two groups: one group was assigned to walk twice weekly or an exercise program; the other group received daily B pill containing 5-mg  Folc acid, 0.4mb B12 / 50 mg B6, or placebo pill. A total of fifty-two elderly people were included. Their pain was measured by six minute walk test and their health-related Quality of Life was assessed by ShortForm 12 Mental and Physical Component scales. After six and twelve months, using the population specific DementiA Quality -Of-Life. At baseline levels of quality had relatively high values. Modified intentions to treat trials revealed no positive principal intervention effect of walks or vitamin supplementing. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in physical activity between groups after four months. Finally, it was concluded that walking could be used as an anti-hypertensity treatment for older women with osteoarthritis because it has been shown to improve blood pressure."
22059801,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective, self-assessed health status measure in patients with severe rheusatoidic arthritis. The outcome measures are highly similar to those obtained from other measures, including pain, physical disability, and quality of life. We conclude that physicians and patient-global measures perform better than tender joint count because they are more sensitive to clinically meaningful drug treatment. This paper also discusses the use of observational and longitudinal studies to assess changes in health over time. It is shown that these studies can be used to predict disease course and severity as well as to provide information about improvement and decline in symptoms."
29223954,"In this study, the efficacious and safety of alrocumabus as add- on to statin therapy is compared in patients with high risk of heart disease. The results suggest that alarcozumab may be an effective treatment for patients who have elevated low density lipodyprotein cholesterol levels. This trial compares alarohumabu with ezetesimibe at two different doses: first, a subcutaneously administered antibody against propeptid convertas se subtilisin type 9; second, AMG145, which reduces low dedensit lipoproteincholesterol levels by significantly reducing LDL-c levels in subjects with hypercholsterolemia. Alarokiada's primary endpoint is percent change from base to week 24."
20507592,"Walking For Well-being In the West: A Pedometer-Based Walking Programme in combination with Physical Activity Consultation This study is designed to assess the efficacy of a walk-based walking program in combined with physical activity consulting for people with Type 2, diabetes. The results show that those who receive physical exercise consultation are more physically active than those not, but they also show greater changes in their health after six and 12 months. Although few studies have examined the neighborhood as an appropriate place to examine the quality of life between older adults, this study was designed as r and Omized trial; it was conducted as five hundred eighty two communitydwellers senior residents were eligible through telephone, direct mail, and referral"
19403634,"In this study, we assess the effects of a daily regimen of 15 g of calcium and 500 mL of vitamin D on healthy young people in Northern Ireland. The subjects are assigned to either receive an eight-week regimen or omize control groups. We examine the necessity and safety for an oral calcium/vitamin D regimen; the participants receive no treatment. This study is designed to evaluate the absorption of Calcium by two levels of Vitamin D replettion. It was found that both groups had similar increases in serum 25hydroxyvitamini D concentrations. However, it was not known whether these levels were affected by any other factor. A double- blinded trial was conducted in which 248 elderly women received 440 iu per day with 500 milligrams ofcalcium plus 1,800 hydracycholecalciterol. Both groups showed increased bone mineral denition than did placebo group. They also showed greater changes in cortific thickness of the neck as they were treated with cheese. These results suggest that there may be some effect of small amounts of cavatric and vitaminD supplementation on mineral metabolism but little is known regarding the efficaciousness of these treatments."

To examine whether cytochme P4502D6, which is involved in how to breakdown tollerodenine, is responsible for the absorption of it. A new extended release capsule formulation oftolteredine was compared with an existing immediate release tablet in patients with excessive bladder overactiveness. This trial was performed in 71 US centers from November 21, 2000, until October 18,2001. Overactive bladder symptoms were recorded in 24 hour urinariary diaries at base and at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 and comparisons were also made. Adverse reactions were further evaluated. Two different forms of long-release agents were used: 1) oxybutin chloride or tolerodin tartrate. 2) Antimuscarnics that increase heart rate were more effective than either of these agents. Men who had over active bladder or other lower Urinary Tract symptoms could not respond to monstrous agents or antimuscorinic agents; 3) so lifenacin was better because it did not interfere with their bladder condition. Finally, we examined the efficaciousness of two different dosages of both torodone and alpha blockers in men with overly active Bladder condition as well as those with mild or moderate upper Urinal Trestick symptoms."

This article discusses some of the most promising anti-dementia treatments, including folate, B6, and B12 as well as other low-toxic approaches. A Swedish population of elderly people aged 77 years old were followed for five tests related to medicine management in the direct interview surveys. The results showed that 9.4). Count Bruchandon's disease has rapidly become a public health concern because of its serious economic consequences. There are newer methods of treating the disease, such as chollinesterase inhibiting agents. In this study, we assess the satisfaction of caregivers with patch or capsule treatment in patients with mild-to-mid-Alzheimer disease. We also examine the use of transdermal patches by comparing their efficacy in older people who have more chronic medical problems than younger people."
26094664,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective study on weight loss and changes in health quality of life for patients with Type 2 diabetes. The aim is to determine whether change in body-mass index after laparooscopic adjustment gastric bash can be used to predict long-term effects on health-regarding qualityof life. This study was designed to assess changes over two years in both body mass index and health related qualities after bariatic surgery. We report that there are no significant differences in these measures between time points. Furthermore, it is reported that some patients lose weight more quickly than others. A further study is presented whereby patients who have had an unsuccessful weight reduction attempt receive either medical rehabilitation or supervised weight control. These patients do not show any improvement in their overall health status at follow-up."
27498397,"In this study, we compare the effect of simvastain and piogliltazone on lipids, aponectin, and proinsulin in patients at high risk of heart disease. The results suggest that these two drugs may be superior to one another in terms of blood pressure reduction. We also examine the effects of combined statin therapy on insulin resistance, inflammation, hypercholesteremia, leptosensitivity, or other signs of illness. This study was designed to assess the safety of combination treatment with either alone or as an add-on to standard anti-hypertensive therapy. It showed that both regimens had significant beneficial effects on blood flow, but only one regimen did show any difference in the outcome."

We find that girls with higher body mass index are more likely to purge for weight control than boys with lower self-esteem. This study is particularly important because it will allow us to identify risk factors for overweight and obesity later in young women. The results suggest that men with high body masses are at greater risk for losing their weight than women with low bodiesmast."
30219968,"In this study, we compare the results of a single-arm total knee artroplasty with that of conventional manual surgery. The results are similar in terms of patient comfort and complications. Aim robotic assisted hip replacement is still controversial because of its wider exposure to the proxital femmur and placement on the leg inmaximal hip inclination and external rotation. This study uses an extended follow-up period to assess whether there is improvement in functional outcome and quality-of- life measures between robotized and conventional approaches. We conclude that both methods improve the outcome for patients with knee pain but have significant drawbacks."
32242268,"This prospective, i.v. blinded study is designed to determine whether ligament balacing techniques for rotating knee platform affect post-opportunity knee kinesmatics. Sixteen of the patients consent to receive this procedure and eight receive Ligament Balancing using fixed thick spacer blocks. There are no significant differences between groups during dynamic kneeling activities. Purposive tibofemoral or knee implant movements have a directly influence on patient performance and implant longevity. Accordingly, this study determines whether the overall frequency of undesirable contact tensions during strutting near 90 degrees in full kneel with kinsematically alignmentd total kneearthroplasty are minimal; not different from groups of consecutive surgeons treated by different doctors. The aim was to investigate the degree of freedom of knee movement during weight bearing kneelling. A total of sixteen South Korea female patients after posteriorly stable were randored and ommly recruited. In vigilance, 16 South Korean women were imaged as if they were performing their respective knee replacement. After an initial period of 18 days, the same surgeon performed the identical surgical procedure. Three47 performing orthopedic surgeon's responses were evaluated: ""reproduction of outcome,"" ""best functional outcome"" and ""better kinemacs."" These results were highly rated among physicians. Patient expectations may be important in determining successful outcomes."

Pre- and post-intervention and six and 12 months follow-up by independent testers. The classical group was very poorly affected by symptoms in social interaction category but other common childhood symptoms were more variable than those in control group. In this study, children with autistic spectrum disorder were assigned to one of two groups: 1) Early Start Denver model; 2) community-based intervention; or 3) low intensity behavior treatment. Children who received early intervention showed significant gains in IQ, adaptive behavior, and ASD. These studies suggest that early treatments for social communication may be effective for the management of children on the verge of developing an intellectual disability."
28619779,"In this paper, we describe a novel approach to treating patients with type 2 diabetes. We examine the effects of an intervention on blood pressure, body mass, and other risk factors that are associated with Type 2 disease. The study is based on two randomised controlled trials: one in Germany and another in China. It compares the efficacy of self-regarding lifestyle changes for reducing the risk of developing Type 2, and it uses standardized practice nurses as controls. This trial was designed to assess whether ""hypertensive lifestyle intervention"" could be effective in preventing Type 1, cardiovascular disease, or death in primary care settings. A control group received usual care but had no change in total coronary risk scores or blood fat concentrations. After one year, the pairs of practices were compared by differences in both total chest circumstantial risk score and blood cholesterol and sugar concentration; after three months, they were also comparing their results for different risk factor levels."

Children have lower blood pressure and greater resistance when they exercise at a higher level of work than adults do. The results suggest that there is an exercise-modity-dependent role for the different changes in the body's response to exercise. In this study, we examine the effect of congenital chest disease on exercise tolerance in patients with severe congestive heart disease. We conclude that congenial activity may be beneficial in these patients because it can lead to improved health."

In this study, thirty-six volunteers aged 35-45 years were divided into two groups: one group consumed control bread for eight weeks and the other consumption was a mixture of Lactobillus spoogenes, 1,  105 CFU, and 0.07 G inulin as prebiotics. A double blind trial was conducted to determine the influence of an artificially acidic milk on blood pressure of elderly hypertenive patients. This study showed that sourmilk had remarkably reduced blood flow after ingestion by nearly four and eight wk. Bifilact also improved the severity of treatment-induced nausea during pelvicradiation."
25059850,"In this study, we compare the accuracy of patient-specified instrumentation to that of conventional instruments in total kneearthroplasty. Forty five patients underwent complete knee surgery and were divided into two groups: 22 patients with conventional instrumentations and 23 patients using a Patient-Specific Instrumentation group. The results showed that the ftemoral component was 0.00 o'clock in group A and 0.0 ""1 mm in cluster B. This study is designed to determine whether patient specific instrumenting can improve the precision of total Knee Arthuroplasty by improving the ability of surgeons to accurately plan the joints during the entire procedure. It is hypothesized that such an accurate planning will reduce the amount of time required for surgical intervention."

These results suggest that NMR-spectroscopy may be useful in understanding the relative risk of heart disease among individuals with small or large lipocytes. A double blind, rand-omized cross-over study investigates the effect of metformin and coleseveam on reduced lipostogenation in patients with Type 2 diabetes."
29765338,"In this paper, the authors describe a novel treatment for an orexia narvosa that uses habitual eating behavior to improve weight restoration. They also describe how they used ""an-exp"" -- i.v. anxiety and fear as cues -- to predict whether patients will relapse after weight loss. This new approach is called exposure and response prevention for Anorezia Nervosesa. The first trial compares two outpatient treatments: one focused on eating disorders and the other on mood inlerance. After three years of follow-up, there is significant improvement in the entire group of patients. Although no evidence exists for specific treatments for severe anorexic nervoska, several studies have suggested that separate family members may be more effective than individual therapy. A recent study suggests that children with anodyssey are better treated by multi-disciplinary approaches such as Cognitive Remedition Therapy. However, many adults with food-related illnesses fail to recover from their illness because of their inflexible mental style. Brain scans suggest that these patients show signs of delusions about their physical appearance."

Costs were calculated individually after four weeks, three months, 1 and two years. We also examine the long-term consequences of Whifflelash Neck Sprain injury in patients treated by two different regimens on the first day of the car accident. A previous study has suggested that treatment may be more efficacious when they are matchable to patient characteristics. This study investigates the effects of call center work with machines on upper body discomfort and muskuloskeletal disorders. The results of both studies indicate that there is no significant difference between the three intervention groups. Neck and upperlimb symptoms frequently reported by office workers. Work style interventions are most commonlyused to reduce work related neck and lower limb problems but lifestyle physical activities are becoming morepopular to enhance workers well-being. An integrated care program consisting of an occupational therapy practice, physiotherapist, psychologist, and medical specialist was used to treat these patients. It was concluded that the use of exercise would improve their health and increase their return to work."

The aim is to examine the association between pain, anxiety, depression, activity limitations, participation restrictions, employment status, and exercise performances in women with severe fatigue. In this study, we assess the effect of a self-pacing program on physical health and function in subjects with moderately severe chronic exhaustion. We conclude that it is possible for these patients to improve their quality of life by improving their ability to do daily activities. A multidisciplinary treatment program consisting of grade-d exercise therapy, cognitive behavior therapy or pharmacical treatment has shown little efficacy in short-term improvement. However, there is some evidence that CFS patients have more frequent sleep complaints than healthy controls."

Forty-consecuted subjects with effort-dyspnoena were enrolled in this study. Thirty consecutive patients without effort Dyspitonia mean age 57 years; 52 pack year history; post-brochodilatory forced expiratoryvolume in one second was predicted, consistently with mode-to-evere smoking related chronic airflow limitations. Twenty-four subjects received either predicated or placebo treatment for four weeks. The objective was to assess the efficaciousness of oralmorphine on relieving breathlessness in people with chronic rebuffed lung disease who have not been treated previously. Biomarkers were used to identify surrogate endpoints and to compare repeatability between individuals with and without COPD. In addition, it was found that there was a significant relationship between change in breathless intensity and changes in other measures of severity. These results suggest that an attempt to reduce circulating sputus is associated with reduction in heart failure exacerbitations. A patient's response to corticostosteroids may also be related to their presence of earway inflammation."
29396832,"The aim of this study is to compare the safety, efficacy, and potency of statin-based combination therapy with ezetimib alone in patients with elevated lipoproteins. A double blind, crossover study was performed in 20 patients aged 56+/9 years who were suffering from severe hypocholesterolation and CHD. In addition, we evaluated another form of treatment: ezetitibe plus ATORvastatin. This trial showed significant reductions in lowdensity LDL-Choorerol concentrations when compared to placebo. Furthermore, there was no change in total cholesterol or high-sensitivity ClReactive Protein levels after a single dose of atorvastain as p0.05. Another study examined the effect of anace trapib on blood lipids for patients at primary hypercholestemia. After regaining their normal diet, they were treated with either 10mg escalpatin or 10 mg simva Statin daily. These studies found that ezetimbe reduced both lower and higher amounts of LL-C but did not lead to any significant changes in other markers of heart disease."
27890056,"In this study, we compared the efficaciousness of two different wound dressings for preventing surgical site infection in patients with colored-neopatra. The first was a silver-containing cloth and the second was an ion-silver dressing. We conclude that these are the most effective wound preparations available for treating diseased skin."
32174622,"The survival rate of tooth-restoration is calculated after examining patients' dental records. In this study, the survival rates of crowns, amalgam, and composite resin were examined. A highly significant difference was found among these survival success rates. Two alternative approaches to restoring teeth that had multiple surface lesions were studied in a laboratory longitudinal study. Both methods proved superior to single-rooted primary morals. All primary molecular restorations were reviewed and outcome results were recorded. For Class I cases, three cements with varying retential strength were used. This study also compares the probability of survival and mode of failure of full-coverages bonded with four cement types. It was then concluded that the use of an lubricating agent would have an advantageous effect on the performance of both cement systems."
32268422,"A prospective, observational study involving 35 severely obese subjects was performed. The aim is to examine the effect of long- term weight loss on serum concentration levels of adonectin, visfatine, and resistin in morbally obese patients. In this study, we investigate the effects of laparoscopic Gastric Roux-En-Y gastric bypass on blood concentrations of both leptiin and antagonise. We conclude that these results are due to changes in the body's lipid profile as well as to improvements in insulin sensitivity. This study also determines whether or not there is any relationship between weight reduction and increased expression of leprotin/adiponetin receptor in fat mass."
21735306,"This study focuses on the inter-tester agreement andreliability of the Cosmin Neck Pain Questionnaire, which is used to assess the effect of physical therapy on neck pain. It compares the response means of both the Neck Disability Indicator and the Bourne Mouth Question, two questions frequently used in patients with unrequited neck discomfort. The results suggest that the use of a short form comprehensive outcome measure may be useful for evaluating treatment efficacy in back pain sufferers."
30940994,"In this paper, we describe a method for determining the hardness and fineness of denture linings after three-week exposure to various cleanser solutions. After thirty specimens of Elite Soft Riding were placed in distilledwater at 37 o C, salt hypochloritate 1 % and an experimentalRicinus Communiis solution. The results showed that after seven, fifteen and 183 days, the material improved significantly than before. This study is intended to evaluate the effect of soft tissue health on the appearance of roughness in dentures. Thirty patients with or without stomatis were accepted into the study. They received either Molloplastb /GC Reline Plus or Silagum comfort relines. Their performance was evaluated by nine different measures: physical integrity, surface detail, adhetion, color, odor, plaque accumulation, resilience, hygiene, and mucousal condition. A four point categorized scale was used. Poor, fair, good, excellent; unscheduled maintaining events and the absence of fungal colonies were also recorded. Biofilm formation was performed in two-way experiments with 30 wearers."
24641632,"In this paper, we describe the effect of a brief psychological intervention on treatment satisfaction for patients with obstructive erectilial dysfunction. We examine the effects of adding an educational intervention to sildenalfil in treating men with severe ED. The results indicate that psychoeducational therapy is more effective than silldenafil or placebo in improving patient satisfaction. This study also demonstrates that short-term counseling can be very successful in relieving dysfunctional behavior."
28065886,"This study aims to compare the safety and efficiacy of cryoballon ablation for atrium fibrillation in patients with thrombosis. It is a prospective, observational study that consists of 605 patients who have been treated with either cryostablation or drug therapy. The results indicate that both methods lead to freedom from atarrhythmia after 12 months. A second-generation device called the ""Cryo Balloon"" has recently been developed to treat paroxysmal atrial fibrilation. In this study, we report on the success of two different approaches: one using contact force technology and the other using conventional balloon technology. We conclude that these newer devices are more successful than their older counterparts."
17204567,"This paper focuses on the effects of diet and activity on patients with knee pain. It is shown that weight loss, combined with exercise, has the most positive effect on physical function in older adults with severe knee Ostearthritis. The results suggest that this intervention may be more effective than usual care for improving physical functions in overweight and obesity-adolescents who have knee injuries."
28251248,"This is a long-term, descriptive study of the relationship between fatigue and physical health quality of life. It examines the effects of anthraxecine-based regimens on women with stage I to IIIA breastcancer. In this study, patients receive either dose-tongue taxane, dosedense taxanse or ard taxanie. The aim of this trial is to determine the efficacy of exercise in treating patients with gerd-related sleep problems and chronic fatigue. Aiming to improve sleep quality and reduce fatigue among rheuumaToid Arthritan patients, we examined moderator and mediators for objective sleep improvement in relapsing-and-omized control trial among under active midlife and elderly adults reporting mild-to- moderate sleep complaints."
23483932,"The effect of nitridipine on the risk of stroke in elderly patients is reported. In this study, we compare the efficacy and safety of two different blood pressure-reducing drugs, e prosartan and nicotine. After adjusting for age, gender, and previous cardiovascular events, both groups showed significant reductions in total mortality and severity of incident. A single- blind trial was conducted by the Shanghai institute of hypertension in sixteen32 subjects aged sixty-seven years with severe hypertensies. Both groups had no significant differences in their baseline characteristics during the entire study period. Metametrids We enrolled 14,881 patients aged 50 / 74 years at health centers in Norway and Swedish who had diatonic or acute myomycardial infiltrates. FosinOpril versus amlopidine Cardiovascular Endpoints R and Omized Trial This trial examined whether fosintepine can reduce the risks of heart attack and death in older patients without any known risk factors. It was concluded that it would be more effective to use an antihypertinergic agent such as lacidiphine than to employ a beta blocker."
25882585,"In this paper, the effects of two-step and three-way self-etch methods on enamel are investigated. The results indicate that the new one- step system is superior to the other in terms of bonding strength and morphology. This study also establishes that there is no difference in bond strength between the two different types of adhesives when they are applied to enamel."
18362249,"In this study, we examine the efficacy and safety of a new approach to treatment for patients with syphilis. We compare the use of pulsemonary vein isolated ablation with conventional methods in treating atrial fibrilation. The results suggest that using an alternative approach may be more effective than traditional methods. A prospective, open-label, random-experimenting study is conducted in which 70 patients are treated with either standard or modified pulmonary vein isolation. After three months, the patients receive either regimen. At least one patient experiences new-onset right atrium tatchycardia after the procedure. This study also reports on the relationship between survival and time-reliable factors. It concludes by comparing the risk of death from age, heart failure, stroke, and other risk factors over time."
30322097,"In this paper, the German Nutrition Society has recommended a daily amount of vitamin D for women of childbirth. This is an open-label trial in which pregnant women receive either 200 or 800 ug. The results are mixed. Pregnancy blood methylation and pregnancy outcome are not included. A recent European meeting on ""the latest advances in relation"" to vitaminD was held in Germany. There were many studies that suggested that there may be some risk of developing preeclamsia due to low levels of 25-hydroxyvindomin D. However, evidence from several large prospective studies suggests that it may have rambling effects on other systems. Some studies suggest that men with high-25-OHD concentrations may benefit from taking up more than one dose of these nutrients. Another study shows that maternal 25HhD level is associated with bone mineral content at birth. Women who had received only cholecaliferol during pregnancy showed greater whole body bone mass when they were born. Maternally, however, no single monthly supplement was as effective as breast milk in increasing 25 HhV1 concentration into their infants."
30858729,"Preoperative and Early Postoperative Rehabilitation for patients with lung-cancer who have a high VO2max but no predicted survival. This is an important study because it does not yet exist in the large-scale, long-term medical practice setting of the ProLUCA study. Its purpose is to investigate whether preoperative or early postoperative exercise can improve surgical morbidities and lung function among lung cancer patients without prior experience of exercise. The results of this study are as follows: 1) there is no difference in performance between the two treatment groups; 2) there was no change in pulmonary function tests after surgery; and 3) there were no complications during the first three months after operation."
11955031,"The objective of this study is to estimate the impact of high dose therapy in newly-diagnosed, solitary patients less than sixty years old. In this population, 274 patients were treated according with a specified intense-therapy protocol. Of these 348 patients, 271 were assigned according to an agreed-upon intensity-treatment protocol; 175 were untreated and 105 were conventionally treated controls. Pepicheral blood cell transplantation has recently been used for reconstitating hemopoetic stem cell function after Myelofa treatment. A recent study suggests that autologous wound dressing can improve survival of patients suffering from multiple myelloma. This study also compares two different regimens of bone mechanolysis: one using melphalans and total body Irradiation and another using allogenec bone march transplantations. It finds that both regimen result in improved survival when compared to conventional chemotherapy. However, there are still some patients who fail to respond to either regimen."
21722355,"In this paper, Wu focuses on the association between muscle strength and the risk of disability among elderly Mexican Americans. He uses a seven-year prospective cohort study to examine the effect of muscular strength on functional decline in older men and women. The results suggest that there is an association with physical weakness and weight loss as well as an increase in the frequency of ADL problems among older people. Although no specific risk factors are identified for these conditions, it is suggested that they may be related to other riskfactors."
22472341,"The American Heart Association's ""prevention and treatment of endo Cardiotis"" paper is a summary of the latest evidence on infectives endopsis. Two studies have been performed, one on prophylacis with cefurixme and another on metirondazole. In both groups, wound infections and Ury tract infection were similar. A single dose of antibioticprophylax was effective in reducing these complications. However, there are still concerns about the safety of this regimen since it does not prevent spontaneous or complete abortal hyterectomy. This paper also discusses the use of propholactic antibiotics for patients who undergo major surgery."
23128863,"This paper describes the effects of weight reduction and exercise on patients with knee Ostearthritis. The subjects receive either a diet-based exercise program or an exercise regimen, and their pain scores are measured after six months. In addition, they report changes in self-reporting pain and function as measured by Western Ontario and MacMaster Universities Ostegoarthrites Index. A total group of 304 older adults with confirmed knee osteoarthrits were assigned to either one of four 18-month intervention groups: dietary loss, exercise, diet plus exercise; or healthy lifestyle controls. After 6 months, no effect was observed upon exercise cesation. Another study examines the benefits of physical activity for overweight and obese elderly men and women who have knee arthritis. It is found that both exercises improve physical function and pain. Massage therapy is another promising treatment for knee disease. However, it is uncertain whether this efficacy can be relied upon. For example, we present omization of sixty-two female patients into three groups according to birthdate sand wedge elevation. We then compare the results of two different types of massage treatments -- transcutaneous nerve stimuli and electroacupuncture -- on knee diseases. Both methods show significant improvements in pain at rest, stiffness, 50 foot walk time, quadricepps muscle strength, but no significant change in symptoms during the follow-up period. Furthermore, all three methods seem to be effective in treating knee injuries. These studies also include several other articles concerning physiotherapy. Some of these articles focus on improving quality of life among older people suffering from knee pain while others concentrate on health education."
20824372,"This paper presents the results of a prospective, cross-sectional study in France on colorectinal patients. The main measure of mortality was post-in-hospital morbidity. A French association for surgery, the French Association Française De Chirurgiy, uses Pedringano's P-POSUM and Cr-POSSUM scores to predict outcome in colon cancer patients who undergo major surgery in the U.S."
29561949,"This study focuses on the effects of five different root canal-sealing agents on bonding strength of glass post. The results indicate that the cements used in these posts are much stronger than those used for cementing other types of posts. In this paper, the effect of these different agents is compared with that of conventional sealers. It is concluded that there is no difference in the amount of solution used to treat the surface of the tooth before cementation and that it is therefore necessary to use different methods for treating the root Canals."
26581769,"This paper reviews three published papers on the efficacy and long-term performance of two different restorative materials in primary teeth. The first study focuses on using resin modified glass Ionomers as an alternative to amalgam for treating primary morals. In this fourth study, the authors examine two new and improved material s that show similar results in terms of their effectiveness in class II restorations over three years. They conclude that the ""new"" material does not always show superior clinical properties. Finally, they evaluate the cumulative survival rates of amalgam or traumatic restreative treatment inprimal teeth during a cluster-rand-omized control trial. All patients receive one Class II replacement of resin-molar easymix and one of amalgam. After six months, one year, two years, and threeyear recall appointments, each patient receives oneClass II Restoration of Resin-Modified glass-IonOmer Cement and One of Amplific. Onexfoliation, teeth with experimented tooth surfaces were retrieved; after exfoliating, it was gathered and measured for inhibiting demineralizing at restoration margin"
17329725,"Heart failure treatment guideline emphasizes daily weight and symptoms reporting in patients with severe heart failure, but little is known about the effect of this practice on readmission rates. A telemedicine-based system has been developed that overcomes geographyal isolation among patients on intense insulin therapy. Children and young adults under the age 26 participate in a program that allows them to record daily blood glucose values at home and receive feedback from nane doctors. The results of the study indicate that home telecommunication improves outcomes for patients who are at risk of hospital or death. Heart Failure is associated with high riskof hospitalization and Poor prognosia. Telemoniring could help implementation and maintain effective medicine and detect worseining heart fail. In addition, it may reduce the frequency of outpatient care by reducing the number of visits per day. This pilot study compares the use of telephone technology to improve control of Type 1 diabetes in adult patients. Forty two patients were followed for twelve weeks. There was no significant difference between Hba1c count and weight between groups at the start of each period. Blood glucose records were now automatically sent daily to ""SHL"" ; they also received immediate feedback regarding the carbohidrate, protein, fat content of meals, as well As the calorie contents. These studies have shown that physicians can use these new methods to diagnose and treat various diseases."
17943887,"In this chapter, we describe the current state of knowledge about interstitial and painful cystitis. We present a double blinded, placebo-controlled trial of intravesic pentosansalphosphosulphate compared with standard treatment in patients with ""interstitive"" or overactive bladder disease. The results show that PPS is more effective than placebo in treating these patients. A group of experts from around the World meet in Kyoto, Japan to discuss the use of the National Institute for Diagnostics and Science's criteria for diagnosis of intertitial diseases. This workshop was held in March 2003 at the International Symposium on Urodynamic Cystics in Geneva, Switzerland. There were many discussions regarding the appropriateness of using the NIDADK Criteria for diagnosing such conditions. Many physicians used the standards but there was no consensus as to what should be done. These included large-scale studies trying to define the role of hypocrisy, bladder distension, and biopsy; and an attempt to develop one single evidence-based approach to diagnose ic."
30470205,"This paper describes a novel exercise program for older patients. It uses leaflets to increase the volume of training but does not improve adherence. The main outcome is that elderly patients with mild to severe dementia are better able to sit, stand, and walk than they were before their illness. A prospective observational study examines the effect of resistance strength training on functional status in older people who have been hospitalized for several weeks. In this study, we assess the effects of progressive resistance-strength training over eight weeks on patient function. We find no significant difference in the length of posture sway between the two groups after these exercises. Older adults receive inpatient rehabilitation with low activity levels or poor mobility outcomes. Therefore, the objective of this trial was to evaluate an randomized control trial of enhanced physical activities in old adults receiving rehabilitation. Methods: Patients admitted to acute care hospitals with medical illnesses between October2002 and July2003. Age ranged from 70 to 80 years. Measurments At the timeof hospital admission, patients or surrogates had their independence in 5 ADLs; bathing, dressing, eating, transferring, etc. 2 weeks before arrival. Rationale: Exacerbasation of chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease can lead to loss of muscle strength and results in long- term loss"
29689282,"In this paper, we describe the use of functional magnetic resonance-imaging to investigate the relationship between impulsive aggression and physical aggression in young children. We examine the association between aggressive behavior and other early childhood characteristics using a pre-testing framework. Our results suggest that early age is important for distinguishing between different types of aggression. Adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder have poor performance on tasks that involve error-retrieval. Brain activity is also affected by these drugs."
29406017,"In this study, we assess the efficacity and safety of moparfinil in treating fatigue in multiplesclerosis. We compared it to placebo in 16 patients with stable disability. A mean score between 45 and 80 on the modified fatigue impact scale was used. The primary endpoint was change on recall scores from baseline. This is a very important quality of memory for multiple sclerical patients because there are no official drugs for these conditions. However, studies have shown that moprimisol improves memory function in people with multiple-scrambled disease."
19160249,"In this study, we examine the effects of physical activity counseling on Type 2 diabetes patients in Hong Kong. The results indicate that there are significant improvements in knowledge and self-carrying skills for type 2 patients compared with those who do not receive physical education. A culturely appropriate education program for South Americans with Type 2, which is up to 4 times more common than in the white population, is developed. This study compares the effectiveness of an education intervention for people with newly diagnosed Type 1 or Type2 diabetes as well as a conventional care regimen. We conclude that it is possible to improve patient health by educating them in ways that will lead to weight loss and improved blood glucose control."
21712220,"In this paper, Dr. Barlow focuses on the effects of vitamin C as a preventative measure against common winter colds in children. He concludes that it is possible for ""prophylactic"" use of 500mg daily to reduce the severity and duration of cold symptoms by at least two-fold. The results are somewhat divergent, but seem to indicate that there is no difference in the duration or severity of sickness between the two treatment groups. A double-blinded trial was carried out with 172 children aged 8 to 9 years to test the effect of 1000mil daily as an anti-common cold treatment. It found that the length and severity were reduced while the incidence did not increase. This study does not support the efficacy of either regimen. One hundred sixty eight volunteers were randomized to receive either placebo or one 100 mg daily from November to February. They recorded their common cold illnesses and symptoms in diary entries. Both groups experienced less cold illness than the other group; however, they had fewer days of severe illness. There was also pronounced reduction in disability among the patients receiving the higher doses of the prophylacis."
20621942,"In this study, Wuthering Heights demonstrates that the type of incision used to treat Dupuytenren's disease has no significant effect on the rate at which patients undergo fasciectomy. The results suggest that there is a relationship between tension in the palmor fascia and Dupusytren-sdisease. This may be due to the fact that tension induces new tissue growth, leading to an increased recurrance rate."
17566796,"This study focuses on the use of ""Revel's criteria"" as a tool to predict pain relief in patients with back pain. It is reported that only controlled blocks can confirm the zygoapophysisial joints as the pain source in low back painful patients, but previous workers have suggested that these signs may be useful in predicting pain reduction after an initial screening block. A multi-disciplinary expert panel recommends 12 of the best tests for evaluating pain response after control blocks. The results of this study indicate that there is no need for further studies to determine whether or not certain features are associated with pain improvement after controlling controls. In addition, it is found that physical examination does not diagnose lumbar joint disease. However, several studies have shown that magnetic resonance imaging can detect symptomatic changes in the discs. These studies also suggest that using motion provocation combined with MRI can increase the specificity of detecting morphological abnormalities in discography."
19458020,"In this study, we examine the effects of eating a diet rich in alpha liposolic acid on serum pro-inflammatory cytokinse concentrations. We compare three different diets to determine which one is most effective for reducing risk of heart disease. The first diet is an American diet that contains only half of the energy and fat found in nuts. This diet reduces blood cholesterol levels by lowering the ""low-densitity lipometry"" and increasing the amount of polyunsulated fat. A second diet consisting entirely of walnuts has been used to assess the anti-proliferative potential of this particular type of diet."
28496349,"In this chapter, the authors present evidence for the enoprotective role of osteocamin in humans. They report that it has been reported that both total and subcarboxylated fractions of this protein increase blood glucose and improves insulin sensitivity. Adipogenin, one of the few adidiapose-subservient proteins, is also negatively associated with type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, studies have shown that phosphorylated forms of these two different types of protecne can lead to increased levels of insulin resistance in patients with Type 1, as well as an elevated risk of heart attack. This study furthermore investigates whether daily Phylloquinine, containing 500 mg phyloquinonie, can improve bone loss in older people who have vascular disease. The results suggest that vitamin K will be useful in improving endotility in elderly men and women."
18294568,"In this study, we examine the effect of pre-prolonged statin treatment on recurrent acute coronary disease in patients with unstable anguished heart failure. We assess the severity of the disease by measuring C-react protein, serum ammyloid A, and interleptin 6 in 2402 patients who had stable angina or were not able to respond to conventional therapy. This study is designed to determine whether statmins can reduce the risk of death and non fatal ischemic complications after elective chest surgery. The results suggest that early intervention may be more effective than usual in preventing these events."
19420096,"In this study, we systematically examine the effect of single-dose idized oil on children's thyroid function. The results indicate that a single daily dose of udine is sufficient to prevent ill health in an area with high levels of iron and cholera. We also describe the use of multiple-monutrient foodlets for infants who are at high suspense about their resorption of goitor or iron deficient. A double blind, placebo controlled trial was carried out among 304 schoolboys aged 6 -- 12 mo from 10 primary countries in two endemic areas of Africa. Children were assigned to receive either 400mg of lipiodic oil or another placebo. Brain development was examined in these subjects. Although several studies have examined the effects of different types of treatment on brain function, none has been able to show any significant difference in performance between groups receiving one type of intervention and another."
22515411,"Aims: To determine effects of combined Zn and Cr on blood glucose, lipoprotein profile, and serum Creinine in adults with Type 2 diabetes. The results of this study suggest that zinc may be able to reduce the risk of complications from non- Insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus. This study also suggests that long-term zinc treatment may help to prevent secondary complications in type 1 diabetic patients. It is shown that after 3 months of daily zinc supplementation, blood pressure decreases significantly in the Mv group by 8mmHg. In addition, it has been reported that metformin's anti-oxidative activity can improve tissue response to these agents. Furthermore, studies have suggested that combination of zinc, vitamins C, E, as well as other antioxidants may slow or delay the development of age-related macular degeneration."
24957911,"This paper describes the results of sixty two consecutive unicomppartmental kneearthroplastys that were performed using cemented Modena-Galantes implants in 50-one patients. The aim is to report the peak outcome result of the Oxford uncompartment knee replacement through a miniaturely invasive surgery incision. In this study, we compare the laxity and stability of 'tension-guided' vs spacer guided methods for medial U.S. knee prostheses. We determine whether the contraindications for these devices apply to patients who have ""mobile bearing"" knees or those who are younger than 82 years old. A series of domed terial kneereplacements has been performed in 56 patients with varying degrees of pain and function at different follow-up periods. These patients had no significant difference in their pre-operative values either. They also showed improved range of motion after 2 years but did not show any differences in the short-term outcome between the fixed bearing and the mobile bearing."
19581635,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to ablation for patients with parosmal atrium fibrillation. They use open irrigation catheters to achieve greater power and shorter tip length without creating clot on the catheter. The results of this study are compared with that of other methods: 1) using an eight-mm catheter or 2) using ice-guided electric energy delivery. A total 180 patients were treated to the three treatment strategies. Anticoagulation was stopped three days before ablating, and transesphagal echocardiography was performed to determine out whether warfarin had any effect on outcome. This study also compares two versions of 3D electroanatomic map systems in guiding catheter Ablation; they have been used since the early 1900s. CartoxP and CarToMerge can be used as antiarrhythmical drugs but seem less effective than PVI alone because of their longer duration. These studies do not describe the exact sequence of ablate procedures. However, these studies show that there is no difference in the success of either strategy. For example, one patient's isolated left atrial vein isolation leads to recurrent new-onset right atary takycardia. Another patient has pulmonary vein separation which reduces the risk of attrioembolic stroke. Two different approaches are described: first, pulmonary vein seclusion by ostensibly guided electrodes; and second, segmental plethic vein isolate by circumfferential phosphoruspidisthmus abulation. Both approaches lead to improved safety andefficacy."
28678974,"This paper describes a new endodontic system that uses carbon fiber reinforced posts to replace conventional prefabricated posts. The results are promising: Four failures in the post group are recorded at 24 months and 29,56 and 87months compared with two of the control groups at 84 month. A prospective clinical trial is conducted to compare the performance of three different types of post-and-core systems for tooth restoration. In this first study, we examine the survival of teeth restored with either cast or non-post-retained replacements over an extended period of time. We conclude that these treatment options have significant potential for improving the patient's long-term health."
25802737,"The purpose of this study is to develop a prediction rule that predicts the time receiving workers' compensation benefits in patients who have low back pain. It is based on two separate patient-data bases: one for clinical and one as an administrative data base. Prognoses are studies of future events, or the evaluationof associations between risk factor and health outcomes among population s from patients. These studies improve ourunderst anding of the medical course and aid cliniciansin making informed decisions regarding how best to treat patients prognosically. A recent increase in use of systematic reviews has been used to analyze the evidence on these topics. In this paper, we examine whether centralization phenomenon is associated with outcome following an ionic work-hardening program. We also investigate whether physical examination results can predict outcome after surgery or conservative treatment. This study uses pre-specified measures of pain intensity and return to work to determine whether it is possible to predict long-term outcome."
24314354,"In this study, we examine the effect of alerting and decision support on patients with type 1 and 2 dyslipidemia who are not at risk for heart disease. We conclude that an intervention involving nurse led self-management on top of normal care is more successful than usual care in reducing these risk factors. A multicentre trial was conducted to determine whether it was possible to improve patient safety by using telemedicine. The results showed that physicians were less likely to prescribe statins when their patients had no history of use within the previous year. Telemedicine was also promising but unproven because it did not involve blinding outcome data. This study examined the impact of ""an integrated patient-specified electronic clinical reminder"" system on blood pressure, lipoprotein, and cholesterol levels in diabetic patients. It was found that there was a significant improvement in the mean change in Hba1c values over one year after the intervention group. Although many studies have attempted to establish the efficacy of physician-based education systems, little has been done to date regarding the effectiveness of such systems in improving patient health."
30013206,"The aim of this study is to determine the effects of soy milk, probiotics, and trans-reveratrol on mLH1 and mammarine phosphorylation in type II diabetes patients. In this trial, we found that probiotically enriched sory milk significantly reduced promoter cell methylation and increased oxidative stresses in Type II diabetic subjects. This study was followed by a double blinded, placebo-control pilot study to assess the efficacy of different dosages of reversal at six months in treating Type 2 Diabetes mellitateus. It was concluded that both regimens had significant anti-inflammatory effects but did not improve blood pressure or lipid levels."
31368773,"This paper focuses on the effects of several different drugs on blood pressure, heart rate, and other measures of health in adulthood. It uses a large sample of adults with DSM III-R/Dsm-IV-disdiagnosed childhood ADHD to examine the effect of these different treatments on both blood flow and heart function. The results show that there are 125 subjects who have ages between 39 and 9 years. In this study, we investigate whether maternal 25-hydroxyvintim D status is associated with increased risk of hyperactivity disorder in offspring. We conclude that maternal concentrations of 25,hydroxyvitmin D at 13 weeks gestation are associated by greater risk for developing symptoms of attention deficit or hyperactivité disorder during childhood. A previous pilot study suggested that treatment was inadequate. However, here we report that MPH has been found to be effective in treating children with an average daily dose of 1.75 mg/kg. Furthermore, our study describes academic outcomes among young adults without any prior experience of childhood disease. Our aim is to determine whether vitamin D as an adjunctive treatment to methylphoni date improves symptoms over placebo in patients with childhood type of ADHD. Children were assigned either 2000 IU of Vitamin D or placebo after 8 weeks of treatment. They were followed by Conner's parent Rating scale-revised, ADHD-rated scale, weekly parent ratings of evening and morning behavior."
27650684,"The aim of this study is to determine whether the use of an IV-pacitaxel and pac Litaxell regimen improves overall survival in patients with stage II or IV ovarian disease. In this trial, we report that a dosage-dense combination of phosphorus plus carbopane significantly improve progress-free and long-term survival for patients who have been treated with conventional treatment. We conclude that these patients are likely to be better debulked after surgery than they were before. A phase III trial was conducted in which we compared the effectiveness of two different regimens: 1) PDL 50mg/m2 as pd every 4 weeks; 2) PCL 200mb per day followed by three additional rounds of completion chemotherapy. This patient population consisted of 798 women with advanced OVAC, 239 pegylicated liposomeal doxlorubicin, and 374 patients without progression. To compare efficacy against conventional therapy, our group performs ""rand and Omized,"" phase 3, non-inferiority trials"" comparing phosphatlitel plus cyclophagus with  Paclitaxelly Plus Carboloplatin in epithelially ovarian disease where there is no response to first line treatments. Our group also conducts another round of studies on elderly patients' suitability for surgical intervention. These studies include several cases of elderly women who had received preoperative assessment of their condition prior to receiving elective surgery. For older women, however, it is recommended that they receive adequate staging and then adjourning surgery at least once. Women with early-stage hetility or high risk of progressive disease should receive primary de Bulking surgery instead of standard anti-cancer treatment such as intravenous penicillin."
31711532,"In this paper, we describe the efficaciousness of a probiotic-based regimen for infants who have colic. We examine whether it is possible to use Lactobacilus reuri as an adjuvant to conventional medicine in order to treat these children. This study uses large-scale genomics to identify the molecular composition of the gut feces of breastfed and non-bawdered infant subjects. The results suggest that Lacticillin may be effective in treating infantile concholic; however, there are still some concerns about its safety."
27806951,"A cross-sectional population of people aged 18 to 70 years in New York, Australia is gathered to determine the pointness of chronic ankle injuries. The prevalence of acute ankle instability has not yet been determined; however, strength training may be an effective treatment for individuals with chronic injury. In this study, balance training is used as a means of relieving pain and improving function in patients who have suffered from severe or repeated ankle inversions. This study also examines the effects of four-week balanced training program on ankle mechanics and postural control. It is shown that subjects with unstable ankles show significant improvements in their functional performance when compared to controls."
28238400,"In this study, we compare the color stability and performance of two different types of composites: an ormolocer- based bonder and a fifth generation bond agent. We examine the three- year clinical results of these new materials in Class I to II teeth. Forty patients were placed in class I with four restorations under Occlusion. Each patient receives one Definites/Etich & Prime 3,1; one Solitaire 3D Bond, 1; and one Hybrid Restorative material. The objective of this trial is to evaluate how long it takes to cure each type of restoration material after they are applied. This study involves placing eight ClassI and II replacements in 42 patients. After 8 years, 100 and 50 restoration pieces are made. A single person places two Class III or IV restoration on each patient. At least two Restorations are restored by Ceram x. Another prospective study investigates the efficacy of etching and rinse adhesives for treating tooth pain. It was found that there was no significant difference in the stain resistance between the two treatments."
22824531,"In this study, we examine the effects of group education on patients with Type 2 who are not infected with insulin. We find that they lose weight more rapidly and have a better quality of life after six months than they did before. This is an important finding because it suggests that lifestyle changes can be very effective in improving blood sugar control in people with type 2 disease."
29872464,"In this study, we examine the differences in the response of African Americans and Latinos to a sixteen-week intervention designed to improve their insulin sensitivity, aspiration, and inflammation. The results indicate that consumption of sugary soft drinks is associated with increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. We conclude that these changes are not related to weight gain but rather to other dietary habits. A large cohort of adults aged 40-69 years without type 2 disease has been followed for 10 years. All self-reporting cases of type 2, including those who have no previous history of disease, were included. This study was an attempt to prospectively analyze the relation between fiber, glucemia load, diet rich foods, or fiber-rich food with the relative risks of developing type 1 or Type 2. It found that high-glucotse feeding causes no significant change in insulin binding nor in blood glucose concentration; however, highfructosed feeding did lead to reduction both of Insulin Binding and Insuline Sensibility. Furthermore, potatoes seem to increase resistance and reduce the risk among women with body mass index less than 29. Although there is little evidence on the association between sweetened beverages and fat gain, it is clear that they may contribute to the development of types 2 and Type 3 diseases."
29034800,"In this paper, Barlow focuses on the role of hips in the treatment of patients with Patellofomoral pain syndrome. He uses a blinded study to compare the efficiacy of knee- and hip exercises against only knee exercises for patients who have patellofiefemoral symptoms. The results of the study are as follows: after six weeks of supervised exercise programs, and after an at home exercise program. This study is important because it will allow physicians to better understand the effects of different types of exercises on patients' pain and function. It also provides information about the relationship between hip muscles and other body parts that may be associated with patellafiom pain. Although studies have suggested that adding hip strength to conventional knee training can improve long-term outcome, there has not been any specific trials evaluating this effect. Furthermore, no evidence exists regarding the influence of improving the hip abductedor and rotator muscle on pain or function in women with pamplific pain disease."
15762255,"A prospective, international study of a series of hip replacements is performed. The Stanmor prostheses have improved survival rates in the long term but are only slightly better than Charnley's when compared with other methods. In this paper, we describe the results of 55 patients who received cemented total-hip arthrostomies and compare them to those who had uncemented promethesies. We also report on the use of an advanced cementing technique for loosenting stems. Stems that were precoated with hydroxypropyl paint showed superior results in terms of pain and bone growth."
24292820,"This is a long-term, observational study to assess the efficacy and safety of daily doses of 125 nmol. g. D1 in rapidly achieving adequate 25 OHD levels. The subjects were divided into three different groups: control group, no vitamin D2, 105 g per day or 250 ng/day; and two groups receiving 500 m. C. Each group was assigned an equal amount of calcium. In order to establish the relative importance of each group's respective concentrations, the authors calculated the proportion of their daily requirements for 25 H.D. They then measured the time course of the serum 25H.C. using blood samples from all three groups. A significant portion of cardinal surgical patients develop major heart and cerebroval events. These events are associated with low-25Hh.cholecalcifyrol concentration but not with high values. Thus, this study may be useful as evidence that improving status may improve falls and fracture risk."
21821300,"The Eortectomy and Conservative Graduation of Tumoroxylation in Neck and Neck Carcinoma: A Predictive Approach. In this paper, the results of an extended observational period are presented. For example, patients with a tumor that is more than 3 cm in size who have had conventional or radical mastectomy receive better control of their disease after treatment with either chemoartificial or standard therapy. However, there is still uncertainty about the importance of tumor oxygenations in advanced neck and breast carcinomas. An electrode-based technique has been developed to determine intratumoral air tensions in these types of malignant lesions."
31676655,This paper focuses on the use of outcome measures to predict changes in patients with back pain. It uses a mixed-effects approach to estimate the importance of the different outcome instruments and to describe the significance of each score change.
18617867,"This study aims to determine whether physical activity can improve mental health in women who are pregnant. It is a prospective, observational study that compares the effects of an exercise trial on psychological health among previously low- active middle-aged females. The results suggest that there is no reduction in risk for coronary heart diseases among postmenophausal women during their first year of pregnancy and that it does not persist throughout the subsequent years. In contrast, the risk reduction seen in the later stages of the intervention does appear to persist. A further study is performed to assess the acceptability of restorative therapy for hot flushed women. After completing this pilot study, participants were divided into two arms: ""Yarn and control"" and ""Attractive group"". They practiced different forms of relaxation exercises but did not show any change in blood pressure or other measures of health. These studies showed that pranaam training had no significant effect on either ventricular performance or stress."
23682371,"In this study, we examine the effect of a probiotic, Lactobacilus GG, on infants' sensitivity to food and their risk of becoming ill with eczyma during the first two years of life. The results suggest that it is possible to prevent such an episode from occurring in early life by consuming either prebiotic or placebo. After six months, babies are given either one of these three different types of feeding regimens. Atopic rash appears to be reduced in children who receive GLA; however, there is no significant difference in severity between the two groups. This study concludes that maternal consumption of cow's milk has been associated with increased frequency of allergic disease among industrialized countries. Probiotic treatment may also reduce the development of severe opportunities for patients with high-risk rheumatism."
17679673,"Stroke in Denmark is a major cause of stroke. In this paper, we examine the association between reduced flow velocity and spontaneous echosignal contrast in patients with acute atrial fibrillation. The Danish population has an annual stroke rate of 1.94 per 1000 people. We explore risk factors associated with stroke in these patients. Age, relative risk -1.8 per decade, females sex, hypertension, and previous stroke or transience ischemic attacks were independently associated With increased stroke risk. Anticoagulation is commonly used for secondary preventive measures in atrium fibrillation, but it does not seem to be effective in preventing recurrent heart attack. Atherosclaotic Intracranial Artery Stenoisis is important for stroke because it leads to blood clots. Warfarmin is often used as an anticoagulant in older patients who are at high risk of first-ever or recurring stroke due to their prevalvular state. This study determines whether warfarn can be used against such thrombosis in elderly patients without requiring immediate intervention."
21501439,"Pregnancy is a difficult time for pregnant women because of the lack of adequate iron in the body. Iron deficientiency can lead to anemic pregnancy and malaria, so it is recommended that prenatal iron should be given daily or weekly. In this paper, we examine the effect of daily iron andfolic acid on maternal hemoglobin, ferritin-level, and iron absorption during pregnancy. The effects are not statistically different between groups. Fe was found to increase haemologloin concentrations in all anemiad individuals but only in those with serum ferritsin levels less than 50mg/L. This study also determines whether iron supplementation from early pregnancy into late pregnancy reduces the frequency of analemia at birth. It is believed that iron deficition may lead some women to become iron-depleted. However, studies have shown that regular iron supplements do not cause any significant changes in blood counts after delivery."
29866322,"In this paper, we examine whether the results of a cross-over study of one shoe insole, prefabricated foot orthoses, and flat shoes are compared against those of other studies. We conclude that these studies have been performed according to Cochrano's recommended standards for cross over design."
28224415,"This paper focuses on the early intervention of nurses with back injuries in order to determine whether it can be used to reduce the incidence and morbidity due to back injury. It is based upon an earlier intervention that was designed and proven effective, but is now the only intervention currently available that specifically targets work outcome in workers with depression. The study also includes a comparison of the effectiveness of ""workplace-oriented"" grade-d activity treatment for patients with severe low back pain. In addition, this paper discusses the use of patient-supervision communication to prevent sick leave among employees who are returning to work because of major depressive disorders. A population-based omize controlled trial is conducted within ten different hospitals in the United States to evaluate the efficability of 'Shap-at-work' as compared to usual care in managing sickness absence caused by common mental disorders such as depression or anxiety. After three months, the group did not differ from the PHQ 9 measure of response after 3 months. Furthermore, there were no differences between the two groups in symptoms of reduction in severity of 50 %; however, these results were discussed further. To describe the designs of several studies concerning chronic lowback pain, we have described them: 1) An R and Omizedcontrolled trial; 2) Cost-effectiveness assessment; 3) An integrated care program; and 4) A cluster-rand-ommized control trial. These studies focus on improving the health of workers suffering from subacute lower back discomfort. They include recurrent illness absence and time until return to normal work duties. Back injuries are particularly common in those working on medicine, neurology, spine, and surgery. Although many traditional practices do not appreciate importance of work factors, they still show disappointing results during implemented in dailypractice. Major depressed disorder has major consequences both in terms of long sick leaves and reduced functioning. However, evidence - Based treatments for major Depressive disorder are available, their results seem disappointing when implemented into daily practice. For example, one study showed that if workers had been treated with regular occupational therapy instead of standard care, then they would have less days of sick stay than workers without any physical problems. Another study examined the cost-efficency of using standardized work-hardening training to improve the performance of injured workers. This study compares worker-directed behavior with conventional care for sicklisted workers at risk of developing serious disease. Workers with major depression often experience"
21396097,"The aim of the present study is to compare three minimally-invasive restorative treatments for managing tooth caries. In this paper, Dr. Watts focuses on two approaches: 1) conventional in university setting; and 2) modified-convental and superconservative atraumatic Restoratory treatment approach in 'field setting'. After six years, there are no significant survival difference amongst 7 of 9 treatment groups. However, two groups consisting of Fuji IX Gic and Ketatac-molar Aplicap were placed in Class 2 cavities prepared with either glass or amalgam restorations. This study tests the hypothesis that glasses-Ionomer Crystallins prevent secondary rootcaries when fluoridated dentificide is frequently used. Sixteen volunteer volunteers wear palatal Appliances in two phases after which they load with bovine roots restored with one type of glass-IVC cement or another. A further 18% of these replacements are recorded as failed. Since anticoagulation has been reported in several recent studies, it is now believed that fluoride can be used to prevent teeth from bleeding. These studies also suggest that ""flororde"" may have an effect by preventing demineralizing the hard tissues. Therefore, the current investigate is undertaken to determine how small circular preparations made in discs of dentine which had incitement lesions in remaining tissue could contribute to their reminralization."
23478873,"In this paper, we describe a study of two groups of Gambian children: the first group receives iron during the rain-season when malaria is maximal and the second group gives iron only after it has passed through the mosquitoes. The results show that fever in the iron treatment group is more frequently associated with parasitemia than with the placebo group. We conclude that maternal feeding improves infant brain development because it is based mostly on observational research. This study also examines whether long-term or short-lived iron supplementation can be used as an effective treatment for malaria. It was found that pregnant women who were not breastfed had greater gains in their health than those who did not have adequate nutrition. A doubleblind, placebo controlled trial was performed in Kenya to evaluate the effect upon appetite and growth of 87 children aged 6 months to 71 mo. Children were assigned to either daily iron or subcutaneously given 150mg Fe, 20mFe/d or 10mMeBendazole every 3 mo; they were then divided into four different groups. Each group received one dose of iron, zinc, or multivitamin each day. After ninety-Nine Anemic children age 1 - 7 years were split into Four groups, each group receiving 2 mo with iron plus vitamin A, iron Plus Fe 1, or placebo. All subjects were treated for at least one year. Iron deficientiency and malphonic infection are common conditions in developing countries. However, no studies have examined the effects of lowdose iron supplements on malaria infection. There are conflicting evidence about the role of high dose iron extractation in improving malaria disease. For example, some studies suggest that iron may help prevent malaria from getting worse by increasing the severity of its epidemic. Other studies indicate that excessive iron consumption may increase the risk of malaria spreading. One study suggests that mothers should give iron before pregnancy so that there will be less chance of scarlet fever. Another study reports that babies born prematurely do not get better until they are six months old."

In this study, we examine the risk of head injuries among players wearing full faces shields versus those wearing half face guards. We determine that concusses are more severe among men wearing both types of helmets than they are among male players who wear only one type of faceguard. This study also uses ImPACT to assess the effect of neck strength on head injury. It was found that there were no significant differences in severity between girls and boys wearing either type"

21735411,"The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of an eight-month intervention on bone mineral density in post menopausals. In this trial, a daily dose of calcium and vitaminD combined with lifestyle and nutrition counseling was used to improve muscle strength of elderly women. Both groups showed significant increases in serum 25hhD levels after treatment but no cases of hypercalemia were observed. This study determines the healing process for human Ostepraxal fracture by measuring the extent of contactus formation overthe fracture region using biologically accurate methods. It also examines whether or not it is possible to prevent falls in older females at high risks of falling. A double-blinded, placebo- controlled trial was conducted among 302 community aged women living in Perth, Australia, with ergoculerol as compared with either 1,000 IU/ day or placebo. After six years, both groups received 800 mg/d cholecium citrate. These studies are important because they provide evidence that fall risk reduction can be reduced when there is adequate supply of vitamin D. However, these studies do not prove sufficient to predict long-term changes in health."
28432856,"A pilot study is designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of different exercise treatments on patient- reported fatigue and functional condition. In this study, ten patients with severe systemic llupus are divided into two groups: a group that participates in supervised heart-to-heart training and another group not participating in the program. The results show that both types of exercise are safe and do not worsen the severity of the disease. Although individual medication is typically well studied when these placebo controlled studies are performed, studies that indirectly compare treatments are rarely published. This paper describes the efficaciousness of an exercise regimen for treating fatigue in patients who have systemically lupous erythemasus."
20709126,"The purpose of this study was to examine the proportion of female elite athletes and controls without disordered-eating behavior or clinical eating disorders, to investigate how these subjects do not falsely characterize their sport-specific behavior as indicators of disease. All women representing the national team at the junior nor senior level, aged 13-16 years, and age group matched rand and ommly selected population-based controls. From the screend data, a sample of athletes had been invited to participate; from the screening results, an age-gave control group was selected. In part II, all female Elite Athletts represented the National Teams at junior or Senior level were asked to answer standardized questions about bone mineral denizens in order to determine what characterizing the athletes with eating disturbances would be. More than half of the elite males had ""clinical"" eating disorder than those in non-Leanness sports. This study is divided into three parts: first, we assess the frequency of sexual abuse and abuse reported by girls who have anorezia nervocsa; second, We examine whether menstrual function is affected by energy availability; and third, To determine the influence of exercise types and different physical loading patterns on Bone mineral Denidension in elite female Cyclists, runners, swimmers/triathletes etc. These results are similar to that of previous studies. Furthermore, there is greater agreement between face-toface or telephone interview surveys when it comes to eating pathology. Finally, after manipulating young women's energy supply, our study determines the relationship between bone turnover and diet quality in 29 regularly Menstruating sedentaries, habituously seated young ladies of normal body constitution."
30356415,"Selenium is a promising new treatment for Graves' disease because it has been reported that it can help to prevent the recurrence of hyperthroidism. This study aims to assess the effect of this new form of treatment on patients with Gravesses-disease. Forty one patients were assigned to receive methemazole, while another group was assigned additional seleniium therapy for six months. The results showed that both groups improved their concentrations of TSH, anti-Thyroid Peroxidases, and free Thryroxine. In addition, they showed an increase in glutathion peroxidation as well as an increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. These results suggest that Selenium may be beneficial in treating Gravies' diseases."
26628678,"This study focuses on the effects of four different antihypersive drugs on central blood pressure in patients who are isolated from other hypertension. These include losartan, HCTZ, bisoproplol, and atenoticsin. The aim is to determine whether these agents can be used as effective as other antihytensives in reducing both central and back-of-the-ninety-year-olds' central BP. In this paper, we compare the efficacy with that of two more conventional antiHysteriazides: perindopsin, an amalodipine/valsartans combination, or bolognax. Aortic stiffness is measured by pulse wave velocity and echocardiogram. Antihypnertenses may have different effects upon centralblood pressure; however, they do not seem to affect brachial heart pressure. Some studies suggest that one class of drug might be better than another because it has greater effect on arterial rigidity. Another study suggests that vasodensol could reduce central chest pressure even though it does not lower diastoplic blood flow. We conclude that there is little evidence for the superiority of either type of agent over another."
20238349,"The purpose of the present study is to improve care and outcome for patients with heart disease in general practice. It is a two-by-two clustered trial designed to assess the effects of an education program on patient health, physical function, and psychological well-being. In addition, it was found that this program improved blood pressure, lipid levels, as well as other measures of risk. This study also examined the effect of nurse-led preventive care on primary care practices. A pilot study showed that nurses could improve quality of care by improving medical records through their use of information technology. Two further studies were conducted regarding the effectiveness of self-referrals and smoking cessations. One was published in the British Medical Journal; the other was reported in several European countries."
15674407,"In this study, we examine the effects of anti-inflammatory medication on blood pressure. Nineties-seven subjects with mild essentialhypertension were studied in three-phase, multi-centre, double blinded and ommized ; parallel study centered in 15 academic or community clinics. The value for anticoagulant treatment after acute myofa r Ct ionic has been assessed among 1,136 patients admitted to the Brondix Municipal Hospital center. A reduction in the overall mortality was not observed in control men, but there was considerable reduction of the mortality in a group of men with modely severe inctitute angina. Antithrombotic treatments have enjoyed great success in treating these patients. Although aspirin is still recommended for prevention of new myomyal infacultations, it is unclear whether its efficacy can be extended to long-term use. Arthritas and hypotension are frequent causes of comorbitment in elderly patients who are hypertensively treated. These include diuretics, beta blockers, angiotesin-converting inhibitors, central Alpha-Aligns agents, and other Vasodilating agents. They also affect renal function. Blood pressure is measured by 24 hour ambulatory measures. After two weeks of treatment, bloodpressure changes were the same in both groups. This paper concludes that ""nonsteroidal antiirrigative drugs may alterblood pressure through their inhibiting effects on prostagsl and in Bio synthesis."" It further reports that warfarin reduces the risk of death from all causes within two years."
30721699,"In this study, we compared the efficaciousness of low level laser therapy and alphalipoic-acide in treating burning mouth syndrome. Forty four patients were relapsed into four treatment group: Bms/laer, Sob/LA, and SoB/ALA. Thirty-four subjects were assigned into two groups: either 1,200 mg daily or placebo. After 12 weeks, they were followed for 14 weeks. The results showed an improvement in walking tolerance and delay claudic pain onset among peripheral arterial disease. This study is a prospective, double- blind, controlled trial to assess the effects of lipoiic acid on endotothelium dependent arterial dilation in subjects with impairing fasting glucose. It was concluded that hydroxylated stress may partially be responsible for the impaired endometal function in subject with IFG. Aim To investigate whether alph-Liphoic Acid can improve endogenhelial dysfunction by suppressing oxidative stresses in Type 1 diabetics. We enrolled 51 type 1 patients who were treated with ALA 600 milligs once daily for 8 weeks; 42 patients received control group. These patients had severe renal failure and required long periods of hemodylysis. Alpha Lipoica acid has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties which could help prevent these diseases from progressing. Hepatic failure is one of most common modologies in this regard. Antioxidation and antiinflammation are the main risks factors associated with heart disease and other complications as well. Therefore, alpachelic acid might have protective effects against cardiovascular diseaserisk factors via antihypersensitivity. Furthermore, probiotics may have beneficial effects on blood sugar levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes."
31531322,"This study consists of two double blinded, placebo-control studies to compare the efficacy of meperidine and sufenanil in spinal analgesis. The first study was a prospective, doubleblinded trial with 100 parturiants scheduled for electives Cesarean Section under spinal Anesthesia who were assigned to either 0.5 %) hyperbaric Bupivacine or 5 % hyperbatic Liocaine. In each group, there was no significant difference in the Demographic and Operational Data; and the mean intensity for each parturent was assessed during the entirety of the study period by one blind observer. A second study examined the effect of using intrathecal Pethidine as an addition to hyper baric lidocasine on the incidences and severity of colding associated with spine anesthesia. It was concluded that pethicidal added to isoton salines reduces the frequency of shrieking but does not increase the intensity of it. Two other studies investigated the effects of magnesium saltsulphate on perioperative chilling in pregnant women awaiting elective cesaren section. They found that both doses of dex Medetomolidine improved the time of sensory blockade and delayed the onset of side effects. However, their results did not differ from those of control groups."
22381255,"This paper focuses on the effects of physical activity on weight loss and fat loss in older adults. In this study, we examine the effect of exercise on overweight and obese patients who are not currently at risk for Type 2 or Type 3 disease. We conclude that vigorous exercise is associated with improved health outcomes in both men and women."
30948833,"This paper reports the results of a double blind, placebo-control study in which angiotensol-converting enzyme blocker was shown to reduce major endpoints in stable patients after coronary bypass surgery. In this case, it was found that early treatment with such an anti-angiotensin agent reduced all major events except for death. The primary outcome was the combined death, myomyocardial or heart failure, and new overt Heart failure. A mean follow-up period was 4.95 years. It was concluded that antagonizing agents were effective in preventing atherosis in patients with unstable left ventricular dysfunction."
22932280,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficaciousness of iron- fortification in household drinking water among members of low socioeconomic populations of Southern Brazil. Thirty-two untrained women received 100 millig/d as Ferrous Sulfate, or placebo; a group consisting of 12 families was supplied with iron solution with Ascorbic acid. Iron depletion affects endurance capacity and muscle fatity in young women who are not anemic. Women aged 18-35 years were assigned to receive one of four diet groups: 50mg per day iron supplementation, 10 mg per daily iron replacement, and meatsupplement and high food iron diet. Hematogen status and iron concentrations measured every four wk. After 4 weeks, iron status improved in all exercise groups compared by an increase Infusion-mediated up regulation of hemogloin levels may be causing iron deficitiency. Fe-fortenified fruit juice increases haemglobin concentration in menstrual women during military training. This study investigates whether iron supplements can improve physical performance and mental health in female soldiers. A double blinded trial was conducted in thirty-three female subjects aged 19.1 - 35 year old without anemia. Serum transferrin receptor values were measured before treatment and after 4 days. Forty two irondepleted -- serum ferritine 16 microgp/l "", noaneMIC -- women were divided into four groups ""Placebo,"" Supplement, Free choice diet."" Men and women had different levels of their blood counts at baseline and posttest. There was neither significant change in either stature nor in any other measure of activity. Both studies showed that there was no significant difference in hemophilin level or in oxygen uptake."
27883924,"In this study, we examine the effects of drinking green tea on reducing body weight in overweight men. We use a cross-over trial to compare the efficacy of two different forms of green Tea: 1) low-EGCG, 2) high-Geel, and 3) placebo. The results show that consumption of Green Tea increases energy expenditure by increasing fat oxidations. This is an important finding because green extracts have been used as anti-obesity agents for some time. However, studies have not shown any significant effect on blood pressure or lipoprotein levels in humans."

There are few or no studies on a combination primary care andcommunity-based intervention Approach. This approach involves patient counseling about self-care practices and physicians reminders. Aim: To develop an economic model of the health care for type II diabetes initially in the United Kingdom; characterize experience of diabetes- related morbidities as well as the use of medicine re source among 'a typical Type I diabetes cohort'; to estimate long-term differences in anticipated health outcomes and cost attributableto Type II disease; and to Facilite evaluation of policy or intervention in treating Type III diabetes from the fundser's perspective. Abstract The aim of this trial is to compare the risks of cigarette smoke in men who form their habits at various periods,and the extent of reduction in risk after stopping smoking at different age groups. In this study, community lay workers led by promobilas were assigned to one of two arms: usual care only; usual Care + nurse case managers; other arm consisted of normal care plus Nurse Case Manager/Commite health worker team. Methods: A compact sheet structure of inter connected Markov chainmodules was developed to expedite rapid estimation of Cost and Outcome For whole population."" Results: The model permits the assessment of expenses and long term complications experienced by patients suffering from Type 2, including direct health costs associated with main diabetic defects and second order effects on other medical services required by these patients,"" i.e., ""the funder"" would be responsible for providing such treatment. Conclusion: An economic modeling system that can assess costs and life expectancy over time will help determine how much money should be spent on treatments for Type IV diseases. abstract American Indians with Type 1 diabetes live in primarily low- income areas where they have frequent visits to doctors. They report increased mammography frequency and improved physical activity during the first two years of follow-up. These results suggest that there may be some value in using standardized approaches to improving health behavior and health status within Latino communities. Furthermore, several studies have reported that breast-cancer screening reduces mortality in women older than 50 years old. Other studies indicate that supporting patients' self management could lead to improvements in chronic disease conditions. Self-management supports are being used in England through the Expert Patient Programme, which provides lie-"
25039609,"In this paper, we describe a novel approach to treating hypertension in patients who receive all their prescribed drugs in one morning dose. We examine the effect of bedtime regimens on blood pressure control and risk of cardiovascular events in vivo. This is an important aspect of our study because it involves multiple different treatment strategies. For example, some studies have suggested that taking more than one drug at once can lead to increased risk for heart attack or stroke. Another study has shown that changing the time of therapy from day to night can reduce blood flow by reducing the amount of time taken to take the new drug. The authors conclude that there are several reasons for this observation: 1) many previous studies had found that too much reduction of blood-pressure by treatment increases cardiovascular disease; 2) moderate reduction decreases it; and 3) correlation between blood force and CVD risks is stronger for abbreviated ambulatory measures of bp. Furthermore, these studies suggest that ""the relationship between achieve clinic and acute BP andCVD risk"" depends on the duration of the treatment strategy. Thus, they investigate the role of hypotensive treatment schedule upon awakening vs. sleeptime in the relation between achieved clinic/absental  Bp and VdR risk. A prospective open label trial was conducted on 2156 patients with 1044 men 1112 women aged 55.6 mmHhg or diatstolic body mass. It was concluded that the combination of two antihypersive drugs would result in greater protection against both major and minor complications."
30421960,"In this double blinded, randomed, controlled trial, we examined the effects of weight-loss and exercise on 107 older adults who were sixty years of age. They were assigned to one control group, another weight management group or an exercise group; they were given either 200mg reaveratrol per day or placebo for two months. The results showed no significant changes in liver fat contents. Ageing has been associated with reduced vascular function but there are few other interventional studies into patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. We investigated dosage-dependent effects by restingeronation on arterial stiffening in subjects with type 1 diabetes. This was a very controversial study because it did not involve any direct anti-inflammatory action. However, our aim was to investigate whether hepatoprotective effects could be achieved by using combination of epigallocinatechin-3- gallate and Resveratorrol. It was found that these compounds had beneficial effects on blood pressure, glucose, and lipolysis. Furthermore, their effect on atherosculolytic activity was similar to that of polyphenolics such as EGCG plus Resveraretrol which have been reported to exert antiinflammatory effects."
26848580,"In this study, we report on the effect of daily 5,000 IU of vitamin D1 on blood pressure in patients with severe hypertension. The results suggest that daily doses of 1,000 iu/day may be sufficient to improve blood flow and reduce risk of stroke in elderly patients. We also describe a double blind, placebo-control trial in which high levels of 25-Hydrovitamin D are associated with improved endotility function in Type 2 diabetic patients who have poor blood circulation. This is one of the first studies to examine the effects of high-dose IVD on endogeneal function and vasculity in type 2 diabetes."
31611148,"The aim of this study is to compare a paleolithic, old-stone age diet with 'a diabetes diet' as generally recommended for risk factors for heart disease in patients without treatment with insulin. In this trial, the effects of an ""Old Stone Age"" diet on weight loss were compared amongst 13 patients with Type 2 diabetes and 10 men. After two consecutive three-month periods, changes in weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, haemologlobin, and area under the curve was measured by use of four day weighed food record. Results: significant weight Loss was achieved byall dieting groups; but no significant differences between diets after six months. Context: Common concerns When using low-calbohydrate methods as if as part of reducing body composition are the reduction from fat free mass mostly muscular mass, that occurs alongside the fat mass --FM -- loss,and determining the most methodologies to assess those changes. This study examines the effect of changing the amount of carbohydrates or the source of carbohidrate on both glyceric control and cardiovascular diseases in type 2 diabetic patients. Although there are few well-controlled trials, it is not clear how much energy can be lost when consuming high-fat, lowcarbogeneous foods. A very low caloric ketogenic diet has been shown to improve health in people with T1D. However, these studies do not reveal any specific benefits for weight change."
22935297,"This paper focuses on an intervention that uses a family-based, two-part group control trial to increase the frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption among adolescents. The authors test and confirm the hypothesize that priming one's stereotype or trait lead to overt behavior; in particular, they conclude that ""long primping leads to morepronounced behavioral effects"" and that there is little sign of decay for at least fifteen minutes. In this study, we examine the role of self-report habits as predictors regarding overweight and obesity. We find that habituality is associated with increased attentional bias toward smoking cueds in Stroop tasks."
28438641,"In this study, we examine the efficacy of fluoxetine as an antidepressant in patients with malnourished and anorexic nervoses. We conclude that it may be beneficial for these patients to receive a high-dose regimen of treatment. This trial is based on two hypotheses: first, there is some evidence that eating disorders and anxiety are related; and second, certain antipsychotic drugs can induce changes in the central nervous system. These changes are thought to be related to the pathophysiology of both mental and physical disease."
31344892,"This paper focuses on the effect of fasting on memory and attention in healthy young people. It compares two different time intervals: morning and afternoon; and gycaemic condition, which is either glucose or aspartame. The results suggest that both conditions may be beneficial for improving brain function. In this study, we examine the effects of breakfast on children's performance during the day. We find that eating a high-glycaemiamic diet improves mental performance in comparison to an all-day fast. However, it does not lead to improved long-term memory."
32161895,"In this paper, the authors describe a new irrigation technique for treating root canals. They compare it to conventional irrigation methods using needle irrigation and negative pressure devices. The results of this study indicate that endodontic treatment is more effective in relieving pain than needle-irrigation. A second study describes the use of an endovac irrigation system to treat patients with irreversible tooth pain."
28003299,"This paper describes a novel lifestyle intervention for Hispanic patients with prediabite who are at risk for developing Type 2 diabetes. It is shown that weight loss can reduce the risk by reducing blood sugar levels and improving metabolic measures in this group. The study also shows that, after two years of follow-up, there is no significant change in the incidence of type 2 disease amongst the control groups."
18805125,"This paper focuses on the association of blood pressure and cholesterol categories with risk of heart disease in people with type II diabetes. It uses an external validated cohort of British men aged 50-59 years who have not yet had a heart attack to predict their risk for developing CHD. The results suggest that there is little difference between Frammingham risk scores and ProCAM risk functions, but that weight loss does not seem to reduce overall mortality."
28978949,"Telemedicine has been used to improve blood glucose control in Type 2 diabetes patients. In this study, a group of 304 patients with Type 2, who are not insulin-requiring, receives regular care and is followed up at their health center. The results show that there is an overall decrease in the value of Hb1c after 6 months. A further study shows that telemonitors can be used for improving self-care as well as improved blood pressure control. This study also compares the effects of short-term telephone coaching on patient behavior change and quality of life. It was found that these changes were greater than those reported by other studies."
29219102,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of telephone surveys to determine the habits of children aged two to 24 months. The purpose of the survey is to identify the frequency with which parents watch their children's favorite shows and to examine the differences in the types of information that parents find when they search for medical information. This paper presents an example of a study designed to assess the validity of three different approaches to searching for evidence: 1) using PICO, 2) using the ""stand and ard"" Pubmed search system, and finally 3) using Graze, or quality-of-resources, as an approach to evaluating evidence."
22573122,"In this study, we examine the effects of regular moderate intensity physical exercise on endothelium-independent and inactive vasodes. We conclude that exercise training has a protective effect on atheroscomatose disease by reducing platelet aggregateion. This is an important risk factor for heart disease because it reduces the amount of time patients spend walking or running. The results suggest that there may be some benefit in regular physical activity as compared to less vigorous exercise."
16418645,"Back pain is a common cause of back pain in the United States but little is known about its association with other health-related conditions. This study aims to identify risk factors and predict their effects on children aged 9 to 12 years. It uses telegrams to collect information from over 23,000 Australian adults who have been asked to describe their low back discomfort. The results show that there are only two groups of people who experience lowback pain: those who do not suffer, and those without any related disability. A multivariate approach is used to predict whether or not schoolchildren will be able to improve their posture by wearing proper school bags. In this paper, we examine the efficacies of three different approaches to prevent obesity among children age 5 - 7, all of which are based on food and physical activity. Children receive improved back care knowledge after an intervention period of 14 months."
24207135,"In this paper, we describe the results of an eight-year follow-up study of men with localized prostatecancer who had relapsed after radical prostitutes. We conclude that there is little evidence for improved survival in patients treated with long term androgen blockage or immediate adjuvant therapy. A prospective, open-label trial was designed to compare the effects of two different regimens of treatment: short-term abreast therapy followed by rapid retropectomy; and long-lived essrt plus rogent deprivations. The results showed no significant difference in progression free survival between the two regimen groups."
18395982,"This paper focuses on the effect of an active strategy on patients' physical functioning, coping strategies, and beliefs about their low back hurt. The primary aim of this study is to examine the degree to which specificpatient attitudes and belief about medical care or self-care predict future health use. In two primary care sample s, physicians believe that doctors should find ""a definitive cause"" for back pain but do not prescribe any immediate treatment; in third sample, we assess whether a Four-session self Care intervention alters those attitudes toward medicine and behavior shown to predict further uses of these specific services. We also explore the role of psychosocial factors in the pathos of acute backpain. Although there are no national guidelines for treating chronic lowback pain, several studies have been conducted to investigate the efficacy of minimal intervention strategies in terms of improving patient outcomes."
30541375,"In this randomed controlled trial, we evaluate the effectiveness of using a remote-in-home telemedicine system to improve patients' health status and quality of life. We conclude that it can be used as an early warning system for acute exaggerations in patients with severe obstruive pulmonary disease. A pilot study is conducted in Italy to investigate the effect of weekly real-time telephone consultations between hospital-base nurses specialized in respiratory diseases who have been discharged from their respective hospitals after an acute illness. The results indicate that daily real time visits reduce the number of emergency department visits by about two-thirds in the control groups; however, there is no significant difference in mortality among the controls. This study also determines whether or not self-management strategies may improve patient health-related outcome."
25012720,"In this study, we examine the effect of daily pedometer reading on physical activity in overweight and obesity-adolescent women. The results show that the group using the Pedometer increases their steps by 36 p.m. after 12 weeks while the control group remains unchanged. This study is designed to find out whether exercise adherence improves physical function among elderly adults with knee pain. It was found that higher exercise absorption was associated with better performance in six-minute walk distance after 6, and 18 months. A comparison between education and an eight-week walking program was made. Both groups showed greater improvement in physical functions than expected. However, they did not report any change in self-respect or pain scores. Furthermore, both groups had lower dropout rates than anticipated. Another study was performed to assess the effectiveness of ""self-paced"" walking for persons with Type 2 diabetes. Thirty patients were assigned to either education or an 8- week walking regimen. Step counts, actual daily steps count, and adverse event were recorded in each group. All other outcome measures were measured at base, week 9, immediate post-intervention,and 6 months in two groups. Results: The recruitment ratio was 22 pp. and the dropoff rate was lowerthan anticipated; 13 %) to 18 g. Purposity The purpose of these studies was to evaluate how effective a self help physical movement program for people with type 2 Diabetes would be. Methods These subjects were divided into three groups: 1) Education/Advice 2) Education Plus an Eight-Week Walking program ) and 2) Diet plus exercise. They were then followed for 10 weeks. Their main outcome was weight loss, 6-minute walks distance, stairclimb time, pain and stiffenness scores. There was no difference in step counts except for joint space width."
15977010,"This paper describes a comparison of the efficacy of three different measures of health status: self-assessed joint count, grip strength, and laboratory test. The results indicate that gold is more effective than either treatment for rhumatoisd arthritis in terms of physical disability, psychological status, or pain. In addition, the quality of outcome measures are similar to those of physician and patient-global measures. Long-term observational studies provide essential information regarding the course and end of phemies that cannot be provided by controlled trials. These studies constitute the major medical communication in reheumatologies. There have been no consensus on the content of these studies; however, they define five ""core set ofdomains"" that must be included in all such studies. A prospective cohort of patients with wrist and fingers was studied within 24 hours before surgery but at least six months after surgery. Five health assessment questions were asked as well as an articular scale for measuring tenderness. An arthroscopic index was developed for the evaluation of joints in patients who had undergone total knee or hip replacement. It was found to be highly reproducible between physicians both within and outside of them. However, it was not possible to detect changes in joint scores because of its interrater errors. Finally, this paper discusses the use of hand-held dolorimetry to measure joint stiffness in people with inflammatory joints."
32191359,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft focuses on the differences between the two branches of medicine -- the rand and ommized controlled trial -- and suggests that there are important differences in the way they are used to evaluate public health. We use the Oregon Medicaid lottery to assess the effects of Medicaid Coverage on mental health; how effectively it addresss unmet needs; and how those results differ for those without a past history of depression. The benefits of early education have been shown by several studies, including the High/Spece Perry Prekindergarten program, which improved health outcomes for children aged 5 to 12 years. However, these improvements do not lead to improvement in physical well-being by age 40. For example, during the 1990s welfare reforms, the Florida Family transition program required people to seek employment before receiving welfare assistance. This system also led to changes in poverty among homeless veterans who were eligible to receive federal aid. Look after the child investing in children has had substantial benefits in improving their lives, both during school age years and laterward, as measured by outcome such as employment or income. Early childhood care has been demonstrated with substantial gains in reducing criminality, raising earnings, and increasing education. Prior studies concerning the impact of health insurance upon cancer rates have almost never been explicitly examined, but here we examine the effect of home visiting on pregnancy and child health over two years from birth through age 30. A guide to community preventive services is being prepared under guidance of the task force on community prevention services."

The teeth are restored with resin, and extracted for TBS testing either immediately after six months or after 6 months in function. In this study, we examine the effects of 2 p.C.H. on the bond strength of three different types of dentinal bonding materials: Scotch Bond, single bond, clearfil self-etch, Adper Prompht-l-pop. We compare the results of these experiments to those of other adhesives, such as Adper Single Bond plus, which have been shown to have improved bond strengths over time."
24175602,"Aim This paper is an assessment of the effect of a modified arthritis self- management program with an added emphasis on exercise practice. Osteoartritis of knee is one of major public health issues. Since 1994, primary health care has been using patient education to treat patients with knee disease. The aim here is to evaluate whether this education program improves quality of life and function in older adults who have knee pain. In this study, fifty-four older adult patients were assigned to either exercise or physical activity intervention. After two weeks, they were divided into 2 groups: exercise plus strength training or exerciseplus health education. They were then randomly assigned between these groups. Their main outcome measures were pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and positive affect. These studies are designed to assess whether patients attending specialized nurse specialist receive more benefit than those attending traditional junior hospital doctors. For example, physicians may be better informed of their patients' treatment options when it comes to knee injury. However, many patients do not get adequate information about their treatment plans because they are discordant among physician practices."

The study is a cross sectional prospect involving 191 female patients aged 9-16 years from Turku University central hospital, Finl, and Turki University Central Hospital. In this study, blood samples were collected for four days and food frequency question questions were answered. A total population of 19,1 healthy Jewish children age 6-18 years were followed by five primary care physician offices in the Jerusalem region during the periodOctober 2009 to November 2010. Parents were interviewed about personal and demographic information and sun exposure. Blood sample was obtained for serum-25Hodic D level. Unlabelled Low vitamin D status may predict ricets or osteomalacius. We examined Serum 25OHD concentration as an indication of fracture stress fracture in seven56 military recruiters. Fatigue Bone Stress Frailty is one of most frequently seen injuries in athletics and soldiers. Therefore, the purpose of this trial was to assess the effects of season- long ( September- March) vitamin E supplementation on change in vitamin H status, which is measures of 25thhydroxyvinculin D,body composition, inflammation,and frequency of illness/ injury. Body composition measured by DxA was collected; injury and illness results were calculated. Vitamin D Deficiency defined according to the United States Institute of Medicine Guideline."
12804478,"In this study, Hamilton's anxiety-related scale is used to predict the severity of anxiety in patients with generalised anxiety disorders. The results of the study are compared to those of other anxiety disorder-based measures such as the Hamilton Rating Score and the ClinicalGlobal Impression scale. Hamilton concludes that there is no difference between anxiety and depressed patients but that it is important to note that depression and anxiety do not necessarily share the same symptoms. A total of three57 outpatients with an episode of panic or generalized anxiety were assigned to receive either venilafaxineXR or buspirone for eight weeks. There was high cooccurrence of both types of disorder in the population. Subjects who had major depressive condition had the most likely history of alcohol use. This study compares the efficaciousness and safety of two different forms of treatment: venlafranine extended release and busprione. It was found that subjects with Generalized Anxiety disorder had more than one other disorder at intake; they had higher scores on the ""Ham-A"" Hamilton rating scale for anxiety. They also had greater emotional health scores than those with Major Depressive disorder. Although these patients did not experience any significant changes in their mental health, they showed signs of improved quality of life."
23818412,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates that exercise in warm water can be used to treat patients with a myriad of musculoskeletal and psychological problems. He shows that the effects of exercise on physical function are similar to those of pain and stiffness in both groups. The results of the study indicate that ""perceived exertion"" during prolonged exercise is related to changes in brain activity rather than change in EMG. This suggests that fatigue occurs at the same level of hyper-thermia as it does when the temperature is changed. Aim previous studies have found that swimming has been an effective treatment for fibroyalgis but its efficacy remains largely unexplored."

Two hundred twenty one children were divided into three different groups, sedental control, strength training, and endurance exercise. Fitness improved more than the wait-listed control in all three groups. This study investigates the effect of acute bouts of physical exercise on cognition measured by event-regarding potentials in older people. Thirt thirty-six adult subjects aged 60 to 85 years were assigned to three separate groups: C, St ; and Endurance training. They performed functional fitness test and ERP data before and after 9 weeks of training with three sessions perweek. Important objective physical fitness measures such as 'h and grip Strength' are associated with mental health and can be used to predict changes in brain function. Although people who have mental illnesses experience reduced physical fit and cognitive impairment, the association among muscular strength and consciousness has not been investigated to date. Acute exercises can modulate later cognitive task performance or oscillatory Brain activity measured with EEG acquired while exercised. In this study, fifty-two healthy subjects performed active, moderate-beast walking, bicycling, or passive no exercise sessions in three virtual environments each generating various sense of presence. Older adults and younger aerobicly trained and seated subjects participated in anS1-S2S3 paradigm designed to evict event related potential -- ERP -- and behavior responses to Determine the influence of Cardiovascular Fit on Cognitive and Motor processes. These studies showed that age-related difference for ERP measures was increased amount of the stimulus precedeing negativity prior to S1 but longer latency and equipototiality of P3, in response to pre-exercation.

It is an intervention study consisting of 237 individuals with moderate or severe risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The main outcome measures taken are weight, height, waist circumference, fasting blood pressure, measures of mental distress and general well-being. A structured lifestyle intervention program designed to prevent Type 1 disease was studied in Japanese men at high risk who were assigned either a conventional diet education group or an intense lifestyle change group. In these groups, subjects were instructed to maintain bodymast index of 24.0/m2, which was by diet and activity.

It is designed to teach them how to use the hearing aids, build confidence, and address changes in hearing loss characteristics. The results of this program show that patients who receive pre- or postfitting therapy are better off than those who do not receive it. In addition, they report improved mood, reduced stress, increased marital communication,and improved quality of life on the Hearing Loss-Relational Quality of Life scale. These results suggest that hearing assistive devices may be useful for improving speech recognition abilities among older people with hearing losses."

In addition, it was shown that Lacticillin gg reduces the risk of infection during the first six mo of life. This protective effect occurred throughout the intervention period; however, after two years, the protection did not last. Probiotics have been proposed to treat allergic diseases in children. Acute eczma/dertitis has been reported in the past twenty-five years. There is still little evidence for their efficacy in treating these conditions. However, there are new approaches to improving the quality of lives of children with idiopathic opportunities. These include patient education, which involves teaching parents about how to care for themselves and their babies, as well as using dermatology and immune system prediction tools."
27460044,"In this paper, we discuss the latest developments in the use of vitamin D as a potential treatment for aging. We examine the effect of resistance training on strength and muscle mass in older adults with low serum levels of 1,25HhD. This study is an attempt to determine whether daily dosed of 1,000 iu/d would reduce risk of cardiovascular disease by comparing blood concentrations at different levels. The results indicate that both groups have significant increases in 25-hydroxyvindom D levels than the placebo group. Aim: To assess the effects upon physical performance of elderly patients with osteoplegia or osteophilis. Ninetium-rich subjects received calcium and alfacalcicol; the other subjects were not affected. Age-related changes in bone health were also evaluated. Esther concludes that cacaination may be beneficial because it improves body mass and strength. She furthermore suggests that adding ricota cheese to the diet can increase muscle Mass and Strength in elderly people."
25430608,"In this paper, we describe the results of a large, well-controlled study on blood pressure. We compare the effects of two weight reduction diets: 1) an all-fruit, vegetables, and lowfat dairy diet; and 2) another ""dietary approaches to Stophypertension"" diet. The results show that the Dash diet is more effective than the usual American diet in reducing both blood flow and body weight. Furthermore, it has been reported that it can help prevent heart disease by preventing excessive weight from regaining its lost strength."
30165599,"In this study, we compare the effects on post-hypertension and blood pressure in a three-week diet. The subjects were 164 healthy men who were fed either sacrificial or high-fat fat diets. They were then divided into four groups: low-favorite group, carbohidrate-rich group; middle-class group with only monounstained fatty acids; and high/low fat group without any nuts. We found no differences in blood flow after the dreaded period of eating. However, there were no significant differences between the fasting and ionating factors after each diet's consumption. Furthermore, neither diet had any deleterious affect on blood vessel function. Nuts are not recommended as snack for hyperlipidemia because of their higher fat content. A recent trial has shown that the Mediterranean style diet reduces gystol blood tension in high risk cardiovascular patients. This study also suggests that if you have type 1 diabetes, it is best to stick to an all-carbody diet rather than consuming too much fat."

15480707,"In this paper, the authors describe the use of antibiotics in the postoporous care of children with acute or perforate appendiciitis. They compare the efficaciousness of two different regimens for reducing the risk of complications: one group uses sulfometesrol and trimethoprim while the other uses mezlocilin. A prospective double blind study is carried out on 100 children aged from 5 to 14 years who undergo laparotory appedectomy due to acutely recurrent appenicitis at an early age. The mean duration of fever is significantly longer than that of patients treated with penicillin and Streptomycin. Prolonged delays in surgery are associated with increased incidence of lateappendices, which occur more frequently than in those treated without either agent. Two-thirds of these patients recover uneventfully during the course of their treatment. Although there is some debate as to whether effective management of such patients can be maintained, it is clear that adequate care is necessary. For example, monotherapy with cephalosperin is an effective adjunctive therapy in patients with severe acute Appendix disease. Children with suspected acute appenticititiis often remain in hospital solely after medical and/or surgical treatment but often receive parenteral Antiinfective Therapy. This prospect studies the outcome when children who met specified conditions are discharged directly to complete parental antibiotic therapy."

We conclude that soy-flour based formulations have improved immune status but no significant differences between rotavivirus vaccine responses and breast-fed or soY-protein isolate-derived formula for infants. The aim of this paper is to determine whether exclusive breast feeding affects asthma related outcomes at age six years. A prospective cohort study was conducted in Western Australia where 2187 children were ascertained from antenatal visits at the major hospital in Perth. Thirty two infant groups were recruited into one of the following group: cow milk ""whey"" hydrolysates formula,"" conventional cow dairy formula, Similac, sory-base formula -- Isomil -- and exclusive breastfeeding for greater than four months. Allergies were investigated in 42 children who had a family History of afflicted allergic disease. Forty eight children developed symptoms during the first 3 months of life; those who did not develop symptoms after being breast fed had an increased incidence of whheezing and colic. Babies who received only cowmilk were less likely to develop severe asthma because their mothers were on exclusion diets while they were treated with antigens such as Dermatophagous pteronicsinus Antigen. This study also examined the relationship between infant feed and childhood asthma. It found that maternal asthma was altered by having more time to avoid food and inhalants. There was much evidence that early exposure of alergens can be related to earlier exposure"
28771519,"Pregnant women were randomized to receive either a general diet or an intervention with reduced glyceric load. Both groups improved their blood glucose concentrations and pregnancy outcomes. The control group received obstructive probiotics, while the intervention group was given placebos. In this study, we examined whether consuming choline-rich foods can reduce gestational complications in pregnant women with Type 2 diabetes mellitateus. We found no evidence of any adverse effects on maternal health or pregnancy outcome. However, there are reports that low-gallycemic load is more effective in reducing the risk of maternal morbidity than high-fiber consumption. This study further investigates the effect of adding fiber to the diet on blood sugar control and insulin requirements in women who have type 2 disease."
31906372,"In this paper, we report the results of a three-week, doubleblind, placebo-control study on the effects of probiotic cheese on patients with obesity. The subjects received fiftygrams of each cheese and their energy was measured. Blood pressure, blood lipids, and lipoproteins were measured; these values were then used to predict the risk of heart disease in women who had been postmenopause for at least one year."
22510792,"In this study, we examine the effect of a higher-protein diet on bone mineral loss in overweight women. The results suggest that high-quality protein diets may be more effective for weight loss than lower-carbogeneous or highly omilizable diet regimens. We conclude that low-fat and very-low carbohydrate diet plans are superior to those with greater energy. This is because they do not involve large amounts of fat but instead focus on small portions rather than large quantities of carbohydrates. Our main aim is to determine whether these two different types of diet can lead to significant changes in body weight over time."
11406040,"In this paper, we describe the effects of two beta blockers on pregnancy: a calcium-channel blocker, isradipino, and an atenosolol. The results are similar to those reported in other studies; however, they do not seem to have any significant effect on maternal health or behavior. We also report that both groups have higher incidences of pregnancy distress and instrumentation than their untreated counterparts. A double blind, placebo-control trial compares efficacy with safety of alpha-methdopA in the treatment for mild and moderate pregnancy-inducedhypertension. Thirteen pregnant women were assigned to receive either drug group, but only 17 received adequate blood pressure control. This study was followed by another single-blind, double-blind, random-experimenting study wherein patients were divided into three groups: one group treated with bed rest alone, one given with magnesium, then one with pind Olola. Both groups showed marked reductions in mean arterial blood flow during treatment. They also found no difference in birth weight, gestational height, or age. Pregnancy complications occurred more frequently in these groups. These studies suggest that there may be some risk of premature labor in mothers receiving antihyptertensive treatments."
26844102,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether a pre-partum intervention can reduce the risk for Type 2 diabetes in women who have recurrent gestational or acute type 2 disease. This intervention is based on an evidence-based approach, and it was designed to be as effective as the Diabetes Prevention program. Women were assigned to either group after their GDM diagnosis; 83.8 percent consented by the time of the trial. In addition, they were informed that they would receive usual medical care during the follow-up period. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of physical activity among post-gender-disease women. It was found that pregnant women with previous gestationsal conditions were at greater risk of developing Type 2, especially when compared to women without such histories. Although there are other studies reporting the efficaciousness of exercise regimens for older women, no results have been reported."
30086061,"Aim Fast track protocol is used to treat open extraperitotal rectal cancer patients without primary stomas and the quality of life. This study compares fast track with conventional care in patients who have elective color-ectal colonic surgery. In this study, we examine the effect of fasttrack on short-term recovery after open colonosis. We conclude that it is safe for patients to undergo fast tracks because they can reduce hospitalization and improve short term outcomes. The aim was to compare two groups of patients: one group treated with fast tracking and another with traditional care. These patients were divided into two different groups: group 1 consisted of those treated by fast tracked or conventional treatment; group 2 consisteded only of men underwent either procedure. Both groups received similar results from their pre-operation blood samples. They also showed similar changes in inflammation and immune function. Although these differences are not yet clear, they suggest that the use of an evidence-based approach to surgery may be beneficial."
28298219,"This paper focuses on the relationship between physical activity, sleep duration, and gestational weigh gain in pregnant women. Although there is little evidence to support this association, it is clear that physical activities can have an effect on pregnancy outcome. The aim of this study is to determine whether a combination of exercise and diet can reduce the risk for maternal and child-to-be complications during pregnancy. In this trial, we examine the effects of pregnancy behavior on health outcomes among overweight and obesity-sensibly obese women who are not physically active."
23597181,"Enzalutamede, a newer form of methotrexate, has been used to treat castration-prone prostate cancer. In this trial, we stratify 1199 men who received the drug after treatment according to their performance status and pain intensity. Men with high levels of testosterone were more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than those with low levels. The association between sex Hormone levels with mortality was evaluated in an attempt to determine whether or not it is associated with increased risk of heart attack. Adiponectin, another anti-cancer drug, may improve bone mineral density in older men. Bioavailable testosterone levels are below the reference age for young adults; however, many studies have suggested that increasing these levels might lead to improved health. This study compares two different forms of therapy: transdermal patches and placebo patches. One type of patch increases lean mass and the other increases muscle strength. These studies suggest that there may be some threshold concentration of testogenes below which replacement would result in physical and psychological benefit. Most systematic reviews rely upon the assessment of methodological quality of trials. We examine the association among industry funding and results in recent published medical and surgery trials"
31384474,"The Heart exercise and remote technologies intervention involves a personal, automated package with text messages and an secure website with voice messages aim at increasing exercise behavior in people with Ischaemic Heart disease. All participants are eligible to attend community-based heart rehabilitation. A recent meta analysis of surmised activity trackers was useful for independently reduce the time that patients were sedentated. To further tests on this deduction, we compared the ability of wearable activity tracks to reduce STand and prolonged bouts. This study is aimed at evaluating whether use of device alone or in combined with cash incentives leads to increases in physically active and improved health outcomes. In this trial, employees from thirteen organizations in Singapore were assigned control group, activitytracker, trackerplus charity incentives, or trackr plus cash incentive. After six months, they were divided into three groups: control; activity tracking devices; Fitbit Zip Activity trackler; Tracker plus charity rewards; or countenance plus Cash incentives. They had English speaking adults aged 21 years or more, age 18 years old, and not pregnant. The objective of cardiac therapy is to prevent recurring events during myocardialty injury. An app-controlled home service delivery program improves post-MI patient's physical activity by reducing the duration of their regimen. However, when participation ceases, adherence does not improve. Therefore, the goal of this pilot studies is ""to evaluate if it could sustain fitness and physical action levels gained during cardiac rehabilitation."" Although most systematic reviews rely upon the assessment of methodological quality of individual trials, there is little evidence regarding the efficability of these approaches. For example, one study examined the effect of wearing an accelerometer-mounted fitbit tracked device on exercise capacity but did not show any change in exercise performance. Another study investigated the effectiveness of using telemedicine technology to improve exercise training in patients with low risk for early death. It was concluded that although the safety of exercise treatment has not yet been established, some aspects of the technique have been proven valid. These include self-reporting physical activities and psychological status. Cost-effectiveness evaluations were conducted as well."
29561067,"In this paper, we describe the effects of a combinationof omega-3 polynsulated fatty acid and an antioxidant on symptoms in patients with early-onset psychosis. We report that NAC is more effective than placebo in improving symptoms for patients who have been treated with antipsychotic drugs for two years. A previous study showed that taurine was safe and efficacious in treating first-epidisode disorder. This study also reports that brain glutathone levels are reduced in schizophrenia. The aim here is to investigate whether inflammatory markers act as predictors of response to long-chain alpha-linoic acid or not. It is shown that adding E-EPA to treatment reduces the risk of progressing to severe depression in subjects with mild depressive disorders. Furthermore, it has been suggested that low vitamin D may be associated with increased susceptibility to disease. These results suggest that there is some benefit in taking B-Vitamins along with B vitamins when used as an addon to conventional antipsytic therapy."
24287215,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft et al. describes the results of a novel exercise trial in which patients with hip arthrocostinus receive home-based exercises and then follow an outpatient program for six weeks. The results are mixed, with no significant differences in gait or strength between patients who received home treatment and those who underwent physiotherapy. A second paper describes how the assessment of quality of life, or ""AQoL,"" is used to predict health-related qualities such as physical function and agility."
22852063,"Pregnancy and labor outcomes are compared in a Peruvian population with low zinc diets. Women receive daily prenatal iron and zinc supplements from 10 to 24 of pregnancy, but only women who do not use contraceptives receive any benefit. A double blind, randozed control trial is conducted in Lima, Peru to assess the effects of maternal zinc-supplementation on pregnancy outcome. In this study, we examine the effect of pregnant women's consumption of zinc on infant growth during gestation through age 1 year. The results indicate that mothers consume more zinc than their breastfed babies; however, there is no association between mother-to-baby ratio or child birth weight."
25843244,"In this paper, we examine the efficacy and effectiveness of a small-monetary incentive in reducing low-distance lipoprotein levels among employees. We compare two approaches for weight loss: contingency therapy and motivational Enhancement therapy. The first is an eight-week program that involves daily walking with participants who are assigned to either standard behavior therapy or supervised walks. After 18 months, all patients were assigned one of three treatment groups: steward behavior intervention, accompanied by personal trainers, who made telephone reminders and did make up their walk; StAndard Behavior therapy, which consisted of self-repetition and physical exercise; and STT Plus Food provision and incentives. All patients received food at least once per week during the period of the trial. This study was designed to assess the effect of financial incentives on smoking cessations in work setting. It found that there was no significant difference in the rate of abstinencing from smoking when compared to those without money. A second study examined the effects of lottery tickets on response rates as well as the use of reward-based strategies for improving health behavior in African American veterans. These studies showed that peer mentors could be more effective than traditional medical care in helping black veterans quit smoking."
24529799,"This study focuses on the effect of two-step finishing/polizing systems on composites. The results indicate that the first step produces the best surface, while the second and third steps produce the worst. In this study, the effects of three different types of bleaching agents are compared: hydrogen peroxe, whiteness, and carbamine peroxide. Six samples from each material were treated with each agent according to the manufacturer's instructions. After six days, specimens were exposed to pH-cyclizing conditions for 12 days. A total set of thirty disc-shaped pieces were cured in a mylanar strip under an acidic solution. Thirtily, twenty-one sample groups were assigned to three polishing groups. Each group was assigned one of seven finishing and Polishing methods. Two groups received no treatment after being deposited under the Mylaar strips. Twenty-three specimen sets were divided among three finishes and polishers groups; five groups served as the controls. These studies examined the roughness of several different kinds of polymerized materials including nanocomposures, hybridas, ormogenes used in restorative applications. They were then polished by four different techniques."
19555517,"The effect of garlic in patients with cholesteremia is described. In this study, we examine the effects that garlic has on lipophosphorylation and total cholesterol levels in subjects with hypercholsterolemia. We conclude that it may be beneficial to use garlic as a preventive measure against cardiovascular disease. A doubleblind, placebo controlled pilot study was performed in nine healthy subjects who were given garlic for six months or followed for another two months without garlic. This trial showed that both garlic and garlic extract reduced blood lipid concentrations but did not alter the serum cholesterol content. Garlic also improved the risk of heart attack in men with coronary disease; however, no other studies have examined the effect either alone or in combination."
23152283,"Aim To compare risk score algorithms to regard the validity to predict 30 day and 1 year mortality after heart surgery. Pre-oppressive pulmonary rehabilitation is an effective strategy for patients with chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease who undergoes chest artery bypassing procedures. In both groups, patients receive short-term training of their inspiratory muscles in order to reduce the incidence of Post-Opportune Complications. The results of this study suggest that pre-operative inspiratoury muscle training may be useful in reducing post-operatory complications in highrisk patients."
29336593,"In this study, we examine the effects of extended iron therapy on anemia, weight, and height in children with iron-does not improve their developmental test scores. The results indicate that infants receive lower mental tests than those without a history of illness at all three times points after treatment. We conclude that irondeficiencies are common in developing countries; therefore, it is important to determine whether daily iron or iron supplementation will reduce the number of pregnant women who suffer from iron deficiencies before they become pregnant. A double blind, placebo-control trial was performed in India for 136 pregnant girls aged 1 to 8 years. Each group received two mo of either vitamin A, iron, mineral A plus Fe, or both placebo. After 12 weeks, blood concentrations increased more after supplementing with Iron + Folc acid or Iron+Folic acid + Vitamin A than after any placebo or vitaminA alone. Babies in Africa have been found to be deficient in these nutrients because of poor health. This study investigates the effect of different combination of nutrition fortified on improving blood levels ofiron, vitamins A as well as other essential nutrients such as fat, zinc, etc. In China, there are multiple nutrient deficiencies among children. Pregnacies may lead to multiple concurrent deficiencies. These include iron status, which is associated with infection, malaria, human immunedefiency disease, malnourished children, nightblind pregnancy, impending epidemics, diseases caused by HIV, maternal education, quality of water supplies, but also confounding factors."
24717342,"In this study, we examine the effects of different fats on blood phospholipid levels and lipoproproteins in healthy subjects. We conclude that palm-olein, coconut oil, trans-fatty acid, and polyunstained fatty acids all have similar effects on serum lipomecrism. This study is an attempt to determine whether or not these oils can be associated with heart disease in South East Asia. The results of this investigation indicate that there is no association between consumption of high-fat foods and increased risk of heart attack in Latin America."
29168154,"This study focuses on the effects of chlorheXidine, a chemical treatment, and probiotics in treating children with pharngotonsillitis. In this paper, we examine the effect that chlorhxidine has on patients with acute obiticular disease. The results indicate that Streptococci salivarius K 12 can be used as an anti-inflammatory agent against streptostoccal infection in children. We conclude that Blistoblis K12 is safe for use in humans and should be given to children at the beginning of their first year of school. Children are divided into four groups: 1) conventional oral hygiene practices; 2) Blis K-12 plus tongue scraping; 3) Cleopatra's Cleaner Method; and 4) Chlorhexine Plus Probiotic regimen. After 6 months, the subjects were evaluated for tolerance and for symptoms of scarlet fever or acute Otitis media. Flawds within the design, conduct, analysis,and reporting of trials can causethe effect of an intervening intervention to be overestimed or underestimated. A multi-sensory approach called Bionox was used to assess whether it could be accurate enough to treat patients suffering from chronic periodonitis. Twenty patients treated with Lactobacterus brevi were included. They were then compared with two validated odor judges. Thirty patients suffered from severe haliToss during an experiment of 12 dayswithout mechanical plaque control. At least three weeks of professional cleaning followed by daily rinseout periods were required. All subjects had been instructed to rinse twice /day with one of these formulations. Each experimental period consisted of six different concentrations of VSCs and low molecular weight amines which were measured by the nichydrin method. Results showed no significant difference in either group. No differences were detected between periods. There was also no change in levels of volatile sulfur Components when comparing the pH value of the probiote solution with the placebo solution. Furthermore, there was no apparent increase in the concentration of Volsic Sulphur Compounds after the trial."
29793496,"The aim of this study is to assess the effect of soy-derived pinatol on blood glycemia and cardiovascular risk in patients with Type II diabetes. In this trial, 30 patients received either 600 mg or placebo twice per day for 13 weeks. This was a good dose of treatment but did not affect the concentrations of circulating Insulin, levels of Serum androgens, and frequency of Ovulation in women with the Polycysic ovary Syndrome. We performed laboratory studies before and after treatment and measured serum progestesteroneconcentrations weekly. A new dietary supplement that combined coconut polyphenols/myo-inoxitolic, has been used as an anti-disruptive agent in post menopausals with metabolic syndrome. Biomarkers of heart disease are highly correlated with Bloodcholestic levels; therefore, it is recommended that diet be the main treatment for all dilapidated patients."
30544168,"In this paper, we describe the effects of weight loss on renal sinus fat and parenchymal fat by whole body Magnetic Resonance-Imaging. We compare four diets that represent a spectrum from low to high carbohydrate content for effect on weight Loss and related Metabolic Variables. The first diet is based on choloric carbohydrates with an emphasis on small dense lipoprotein concentrations; the second is composed of large amounts of saturated fat. After six months, all subjects lose more weight than they lose on the lowcarbogeneous diet. This study also examines the effect of very low-fat diets on bloodlipids but does not show any significant change in risk factors for heart disease or Type 2 diabetes. A further study is performed on overweight men who are assigned either LC or LF diet after two years of follow-up. Both groups lose greater weight at the end of the trial. These studies have not yet been published. Although there are few trials that extend beyond one year, it is believed that these diet strategies may be effective for weight management."
31613390,"The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of bias in outcome reporting in a series of large, unselected trials. We examine the frequency of missing outcome results in these studies and determine whether it is possible to use sensitivity analysis to identify potential impact of trial reporting bias on reviews that include only one meta-analysis of the primary outcome. This study was designed as an open-ended, parallel-gastroenterologized clinical trial. It examined the effects of combined therapy for weight loss in obese patients. In addition, we investigated the influence of spin on interpretation of results from abstracted controlled trials with statistically significant primary outcomes. Our goal was to provide information regarding variance components of psychological outcomes within and between participant Varnity, within/betweenpartitribuant Correlation and for cluster-rand and Omised trials; the Intr-cluster Correspondence and, also, how estimates of These Varance Components and ICC's can beused to design tense, repeatable experiments. A nine point categorical classification system was used to classify missing endpoints in all eligible trials but did not include any data for the original outcome of interest."
32152453,"The Prevend It is a prospective, observational study of whether treatment of urinary excretion with an overdose of 15mg per 24 hours would reduce the risks of cardiovascular events in subjects with moderately elevated blood pressures. This study was followed for 10 years and found no significant effects on mortality or hospitalization among subjects who had low-risk levels. In this paper, we use two steps to identify trials that have been used to assess efficacy: 1) retrieving references of trials including in published systematic reviews of bp-lowering therapy; 2) retrieveing studies published from the Blood Pressure-Lowering Treatment Trialistics 'Collaboration ) and 3) checking studies referenceed in the World Health Organisation/ International Society of hypertension Meeting memorous Objectives To many current guideline, blood tension-lowing drug treatment forprimary prevention of heart disease should be based upon absolute risk. However, in clinical practices, therapeutic decisions often are governed by  B1 levels alone. Therefore, it is important to determine which approach is superior to using rand and Omized trials. First, he will identify all of these trials as well as any other trial that has been performed. Second, they will compare the results of either intervention against placebo or pre treated subjects in active comparison groups. Third, there will be one post-hoc analysis of Australia National Bloodpressure cohort. We aim to examine whether treating patients with mildly high systelic blood forces them to receive more than adequate doses of antihypensive medication. Methods were then divided into two groups: first, randomised controls received fosinipril 20mG or pravastastatin 40mM or matching placebo; second, randomly assigned control subjects received Fosnipur 20 mg or prvastatpin 40 M or match placebo. After follow-up, the mean relative risk of death or injury was 46 months. A subsequent sub-plot analysis showed that microalbuminura was associated with increased threat of stroke. Although previous studies suggested that blockane of the Renin-Angiotensine system may prevent Type II diabetes in people without cardiovascular disease, this study did not show any significant effect on the primary endpoint of fatal or non Fatal Stroke."
21272751,"In this paper, we describe the results of a single blinded cross-over study in which fifty-two patients were treated with low-dose diuretics and angiotension-converting enzymes. We compare blood pressure response to these two drugs as monotherapies and then compare their effects on both patient characteristics and outcome. The main end point is reduction of daily BP by either drug. A doubleblind, placebo-control study was conducted in 6083 hypertensively patients who were age 65 to 89 years of age. After comparing the efficaciousness of each agent as one or the other, they were compared against the use of proportionalhazards model. This trial examined the effect of exercise training on right ventricular mass and wall thickening in older hypertension. Two-dimension echocardiography was performed at base and after treatment. All subjects were assigned to receive either lacidiphin or HCT for 6 months. Antihypersive efficiacy was found in the antihyportensesive effects of exercises on left valgus geometry and mass index; it was more effective when used alone than with combination. Both groups showed significant reductions in daytime bp from baseline. These results suggest that there may be some benefit in using alcibiades as first line therapy in patients with mildly to moderate hyper tension. However, because certain classes of agents might be more successful than others as molecular treatments, certain class of antihystertinesive agents are more highly effective than those as monstrous agents."
26908700,"In this study, we examine the effect of killing Lactobacilus acidophilous on reducing the risk of nosocolitis in preterm premature infants. We conclude that it is safe to use probiotics as long as they are not associated with disease. A double blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in which preterminatively pregnant patients were given either daily probiota or a combination of two different strains of yeast. The results showed that both groups had reduced the incidence of Necrotizing Enterocotis and Sepsis. Probiotic treatment also improved the growth of pregnant infant girls. This study further investigated the safety of feeding intolerable late-onset enterocollitis among very low- birth weight babies."
24323914,"In this paper, the authors present a crossover study of three different diets: soy and low-proteestrogen foods; wheat-low-patriotic food; and red clovel extract. They conclude that menopause is associated with increased consumption of phytosterogens in women who are not pregnant. The results of this study suggest that high levels of these chemicals may lead to greater urinary exretion of them than those on lower-phosphorylated diet's. A second study investigates the effects of estrogen replacement therapy on glibly gynic symptoms in patients aged 45 to 70 years old. This study compares two different regimens of treatment for postmenopalausal women. One group receives 50mg raw material of papaya mirifica, named in Thai as Kwao Kuea Keno against conjugated Equine Estrogin with/without Medroxy Progesterone Acetate or MPA. Another study examines whether continuous combined hormonal therapy can reduce the severity of hotflues by using an eight-week trial of 1680 postmanopausally women at age 55. Both groups do not suffer from any adverse effects on their endometriUM. These studies were followed by another study investigating the effect of pueraria mirpica on breast tissue. It was found that Puerario mirrica reduced the frequency of cold flusheses in both groups. After six months, however, they did not show any change in the scores of Hot Flets and Night Sweeping. Furthermore, there was no difference in changes in other measures of health such as bone mineral density, blood count, etc. Although many trials have examined the benefits of conventional Hormone Replacement Therapy, few have yet been published. Two large trials had changed the evidence regarding the preventiveness of pregnancy. For example, one showed that use of progestinate could decrease when it was discovered that mammography received less after publication of ""the Heart and Estrocen/progenin Replacement Study"" and 18% after reporting of results from ""The Women'S Health Initiative."" However, because of concerns about the risk of sideeffects caused by conventional hormone therapy, some need for alternative treatments. Soy flour, flaxs seed, and hop extract all appear to be effective in relieving hot flushing. Thus far, neither has been shown to significantly reduce vasomobil symptoms"
20091582,"This paper describes the results of a two-year study in which patients with knee and back pain were assigned to either exercise classes or self-help groups. The results showed significant improvement in their arthritis selfefficacy, use of exercises, pain intensity, and daily activity. In addition, there was no change in health status after intervention. A second study examined the effect of home-based activities on physical function for older adults who had knee pain. It was found that high exerciseadherence was more effective than usual care when it was associated with improvements in six-minute walking distance, weight loss, gait, overall pain, stiffness scores, joint space width, etc. Arthritas, Diet, And Activity Promotion Trial is an eight-week trial designed to determine whether short term exercise and  diet loss are more efficacious than normal care in improving functional function, painful,and mobility among older overweight and obesity adults with neck pain: OsteoArtism; Dietiti,And ActivityProduction Trial"
29462641,"In this study, we examine the value of acoustic event-retrieval potentials in preterm children. Preterm infants are divided into two groups: low risk and high risk. The results show that there is mainly convergent association between risk category and maturity. Aers have been proposed as an independent measure of sound perception. This study further investigates the role of mismatch negativeity in early childhood development. It was found that preterminal babies had higher mismatched negativity than their term-born counterparts."
30395694,"In this paper, we describe the results of a two-week intervention on children with autism. We compare the effects that enhanced milieu teaching and parent-teacher training have on language skills in children who are at least 3 years old. The parents' treatment is more effective than the therapists' only treatment. Children with an autistic background show greater improvement in their joint attention and engagement from pre-treatment to 12 months after follow-up. This study also examines the effect of Early Start Denver model on social communication for young children: it was found that children assigned to either group showed larger increases in attachment related behavior than children given control condition. A single subject design experiment examined two different types of intervention: Denver Model, which merges behavior, development, and relation-oriented intervention; and Prompt, another neuro-developmental approach for speech producing disorders. These studies were followed by several other small trials designed to determine whether or not early childhood interventions can be used to treat adults with Autism Spectrum disorder. Although there has been no well-recognized evidence for these treatments, many reports suggest that early approaches may be effective. For example, one study suggests that infants with severe language delays should be taught how to communicate through imitation. Another study uses child-parent interaction to assess changes in language performance in younger children without any apparent difference in parental response. Parents reported improved social relations among children treated with both kinds of therapy. Two further studies indicate that adult imitations lead to better social relationships in older children."
21567221,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of an exercise-adherence program on patients with heart failing. He uses a cross-over study to determine whether exercise is more effective in improving physical function and health in older adults than it is in younger adults. The results are mixed: there is no difference between the two groups at age, chest disease risk factors, severity of heart failure, and length of hospitalization."
22760566,"Iron fortified rice is a promising strategy against iron deficitiency in the developing world, but little is known about its efficacy. In this paper, we examine the effects of three different types of iron: FeSO4, NaFeEdTA, and ferrous pyrophosphoric acid on body iron stores of anemia-deficient young children. The results indicate that infants receive iron from either food vehicle or cow's milk; however, they do not have any higher incidence of infection or gastrointestinal issues than infant girls on low iron formulas nor cow ""milk"". This study also suggests that leaf concentrate can be used to treat anaemia as well because it contains iron instead of folic acids. A field study was conducted with two groups of mildly Anemic 6-to- 24-mo old children who received either refried Black beans or equivalent but unfortable control meals. At age 9 and 15 Mo, significant differences were encountering in all measurements of Fe  nutrition in favor of both groups. Hematological values were improved significantly in those receiving iron as Mgfepp or EFF at 2 mg per liter salfate. Both groups had similar concentrations of Ferritin, Serum Ferrisin Receptor, Hb concentration, Body Fe stores, respectively. Preparations are made for further testing of these strategies. We assess the effect upon iron status of pregnant women by feeding their breastfed babies until 6 mo of Age. After six months, the group receiving no fortenification iron or reduced iron supplementation had higher iron levels than the control group. They also showed greater absorption of fish sauce when mixed with Niferous Sulfates plus Ascorbic Acid. These studies suggest that iron fortesity may reduce blood lead levels among urban, leadexposed, iron-deprived children in Bangalore, India."
23372566,"This study focuses on the effects that a Latino-based self-management program can have on people with type two diabetes. The results of this intervention are inconclusive, but there is evidence that it does improve blood levels of haemogen A1c by improving quality of life and physical activity. In addition, these results suggest that an African American-American lifestyle intervention may be more effective than usual care for patients with Type 2 disease."
24445948,"In this study, we examine the effects of combination therapy with avodart or tamsonosin on men with moderate to severe lower Ury Tract symptoms. We compare the International Prostate Score, Uroflowmetry, Post-voiding Resertion Volume, and systemic Muscle Volume at baseline and twelve months after treatment. The combined therapy reduces the relative risk of acute urinary retainment, AUR, BPH related surgery, as well as clinical progression over four yr for men at elevated risk"
29159857,"In this paper, we describe a study of children with low-IQ who receive the same dose of methylphini date as other children. The results suggest that it may be beneficial for children to have an immediate effect on their behavior and improve their social communication. Children with attention-difference hyperactivity disorder are also shown to benefit from treatment. A double blinded, placebo-control, crossover study is performed in thirty-two children aged 5 to 13 years with pervasively developmental disorders. They were divided into five academic outpatient centers; seventy- two drug- free children were aged between 5 and 14 years. There were no significant drug effects but there were relatively few differences by condition. To further investigate whether methylpharamine could be used to treat symptoms of attention deficit or hyperactivité disorder, here we examine the effects of repeated dosing on reaction time variability in patients with ADHD. This study was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of methadramhidate against usual care in children older than 7 years age. It was found that subjects showed greater improvement when compared to control subjects. However, some children had side effects such as social withdrawal andirritability at the 0.5mg/kg dose. Another study examined the impact of combination diagnoses of Developmental Coordination Disorder and ADHD on health related quality of life. After treating both groups of subjects, they showed significant improvements in all three of the following symptoms: ""hyperactivity,"" ""impulsivity,"" and ""inattention."""
30903209,"In this paper, we examine the effect that soy and isoflavovones have on bone mineral denition in post-menopaausal women. We conclude that there is no evidence for a positive effect of these two nutrient groups on improving bone health in late-life women; however, several studies have suggested that they may be useful as preventative measures against hip fracture. This study uses standardized food frequency questionnaires to assess the effects of different dietary sources on body mineral density. The results suggest that low phosphorus and calcium are associated with increased bone loss in early-morning men and women, but it does not appear to be an important predictor of fracture risk."
30521577,"This paper describes the development of a patient-reporting tool for reporting clinical trials. It is recommended that patients reported their treatment outcomes as primary or secondary end points in the abstract, but it does not explicitly state how this information is used in practice. In this paper, we present the first results of an extended trial using composite resins to compare the long-term survival of conventional restoration with that of ""art"" in primary teeth. The aim of the trial is to determine whether the Hall Technique, which uses preformed metal cements and no local anesthesia, is more effective than the other two approaches. Children are divided into two groups: one group receives conventional restorations; the second group undergoes hall technique. Both methods have good pain perception and acceptability among children. Acute Restorative treatment has been shown to be more successful in treating dentin lesions in older children who have low caries. However, there is still little evidence regarding the efficacy of these treatments in school settings."
24476510,"In older men with a limited amount of strength, the effects of oestrogen therapy on muscle function and physical function are investigated. The results indicate that there is an improvement in leg press strength after six months of treatment. A multi-faced stroke tele rehabilitation intervention was studied in veterans with post-stroke. This study used the theoretical frameworks of the international classification of functions, disability, and health to create better understitiations and ingratiating factors associated with self-reported health among community dwellers older people in cities and rural areas. It was concluded that exercise training could reduce the risk of future falls and injury in older adults who had been breast cancer survivors. Although no evidence supports this claim, several studies have suggested that diet and exercise can be effective in relieving pain and improving function in elderly people with functional limitations. These studies include two large-scale cross sectional studies designed to assess the prevalence of transportation barriers and facilitatorships for older persons with mobility limitations; one survey examined the frequency of falls among those with both walking and gait speed problems; and another looked at the effect of customary exercise tolerance testing on individuals' habitual Gait Speed. Finally, we performed geriatic assessment using item response theory and computer adaptive test methods. We then compared the accuracy, precision,and sensitivity to changes in scores from two late-life instrumented scales with score estimates from the fixed form instrument. Context: Five year survival rate for early stage Colorectal, breast, or Prostate Cancer currently exceeds 90% and are increasing. Age-related decline has been reported in many different types of adulthood. Some studies suggest that lifestyle intervention may provide benefit but it is not known whether long-lived patients can alter their lifestyle behavior sufficiently to improve function."
19160341,"In this paper, we describe the results of an 18-week family-based exercise and diet change intervention aimed at reducing cardiovascular disease risk in Anglo children, Hispanics, and Mexican-Americans. We examine the efficacy of this intervention in two groups of families with fifth or sixth-grade children."
24726015,"In this study, we examine the effects of cannanol on patients taking opioid painkillers. The results suggest that a high-dose dose may be more effective than standard treatment for patients with severe pain. We also report that short sleep duration has been associated with psychological distress in some patients. This is one of the few studies that relate sleep behavior to drug use and alcohol use. A prospective cohort study from Australia shows that young people sleep less during their early adulthood. Short sleep does not seem to have any negative consequences. However, there are other studies which indicate that sleep problems increase the risk of developing substance use later in life. For example, these studies found clusters of poorly sleeping behavior and drug using among those who had poor sleep habits. These studies showed that insomnia spreads through social networks as well as between individuals who used different kinds of drugs. Cannabines were studied in multiple cranial sclerosis; they were shown to improve spasticity by improving muscle stiffness. They also showed improvements in quality of life when compared to placebo."
29560832,"A prospective, randomized, double-blind study is designed to assess the association between dietary changes and hip fracture risk. The results of this study indicate that a high-calcium diet may reduce the risk of hip injury in older adults. In addition, there is evidence that taking more than one serving of dairy product per day may improve bone mineral content."
26927924,"In this paper, we present the results of a European population-based survey of older people aged 50 years or older. We use the Survey of Heart and Aging in Europe's first wave to translate the Til Burg Frailtiness Indicator into Polish. The study includes 100 patients who were treated at geriatic centers during their one year follow-up. At that point, they investigated nursing home place and death in every group as well as all falls, hospitalization, and greater disability among those still living at homes. A sth and ard type of frailness was associated with increased risk of mortality in aging adults. However, the predictive value of this phonotype for injury is uncertain. To determine whether an antherive phenotypon of ""frailt"" was independently associated With an increased risks of adverse outcomes, including mortality,we examined the predictability of these hypnotisms across risk groups defined by Age and Body Mass Index. Our aim was to compare the prediction validity of two simple measures: weight loss; inability to raise from seated chair 5 timeswithout using arms; and reduced energy levels. Women were categorized as robust, of Intermediate status, or frails according to the presence of several of the following characteristics: unintained weight Loss, weakness, self-Reported Poor energy / Slow Walking Speed & Low physical activity. All men and women were divided into three or more categories: strong, moderate, weak, etc. They were then classified as either stable or fragile. This article describes the method used to assess fralicty in elderly patients. It uses the Cardiovascular Heart Study definition, which suggests that fraility is characterized by declining health across multiple Physiologic systems. There are no single accepted definition of it. After five years, our goal is to develop able-to-use tools that will predict deaths or need for institution care. These include the 7-Poetry Score of Frailtity, developed by Dr. Barlow and his colleagues. As previously described, there has been no consensus on the meaning of its term. For example, some studies have suggested that psychological well being may be associatedwith fraileties. Thus, here we examine the effect of age-related changes on mortality when compared to other means of assessment. Although many studies suggest that mental well-being might be useful in old age, few studies indicate that"

The results of this study are compared with that of the American Osteoartificial Foot and Anken Society's Turkish version of Faas, which has been used for many conditions but not for Hallux rigidus. In this paper, we describe the development of an alternative assessment tool called the ""Fooland-Ankle Score"" or ""FAOS,"" which uses a combination of translation and backward translation to adapt it to the native language of Turks. We also present the results on the patient-report outcome measure, the Short-form 36 health survey. Our aim is to compare the performance of these three measures: the Ffi, Aomedal Achilles Measure, and the Physician-Reported Outcome Measure; and to determine their reliability and consistency in light of patient'ties."
17636648,"In this paper, Dr. Manette focuses on the effect of high doses of alcibiades on patients with colds. He concludes that there is a significant reduction in the severity of the symptoms after taking ascorbicic acid, but that the efficacy of this intervention does not match that of other anticancer agents."
28676426,"In this paper, we describe a new approach to evaluating the significance of change in health-regarding quality of life by comparing the scores of three different measures: the minimal importance difference or mid. We examine the results of several controlled trials in which patients were given multiple treatment regimens and then randomized to one drug or placebo. The mean difference between these two groups was 0.5 points per question. This is the shortest difference that would be useful for physicians to interpret in order to make informed decisions about patient care."
32230939,"This paper describes the results of an exercise intervention for cardiovascular disease risk factor in a large population of St. Louis Missouri employees. The study was designed to compare assessment s with intervention, worksite A; assessment only - one year later; and follow-up for 1 year. In this case, all participants received personal reports describing their assessment results. After two years, blood pressure, body massindex, waist circumference, height, and weight were reduced in both groups. African Americans with Type 2 diabetes receive usual care but receive no nurse intervention. Over time, these changes are significant."
25933128,"In this paper, we examine the effects of behavior therapy on weight loss. We find that both self-controlled and external control treatments are equally effective in reducing weight. For example, initial weight losses are positively related to weight Loss at 30 months. Forty smoking patients and 47 overweight people are recruited for an ""home correspondence program"" for changing their health behaviors. The results show that all three approaches produce significant changes in physical well-being as compared to the changes seen by the ard and st group treatment. This paper discusses the use of incentives for weight reduction. It uses a longer-term intervention with financial incentives. All participants are assigned to either one of four treatment conditions: weekly homework assignments, interim weighins, or refunded participation deposits. Each participant receives 15 weekly lessons by mail. Three features vary factorially: b) homework assignment, interweighed ins; c) interim lose-in's and attendance deposits; and finally d) monthly weigh-outs. Participants are divided into two groups: active treatment condition and delayed treatment control condition. They are randomly assigned between these two types of treatment according to their BMI. Both groups lose more weight than they do in other studies. A study is also conducted to determine whether weight gain expectations affect attrition among obese patients seeking medical treatment"
19360230,"The effect of three tier intervention including moderate energy restriction, reduced carbohydrate, increased protein, and increased physical activity on lipoproteins and atherogenation in overweight and obese women. Carnitine or cellulose was assigned to the subjects using adoubleblind design. Seventium women completed the 10 week protocol,which followed reduction in their food by 15 p.m. and an average macronutrient fuel distribution of30 % Protein, 30 g. fat and 40 h. carbometry. In this study, green tea extract is shown to increase body weight and improve blood oxidation as well as fat loss in healthy men. It also increases resting-electrified energy expenditure and hastens fat absorption. This study investigates the effects of Green Tea Extract on Body Weight and Biochemical and Hormone Profiles in Obessive Chinese Women with Polycysic Ovariary Syndrome. After two weeks of diet run-out period, he / she ate three self- selected meals andfour isoen energetic snacks daily without any supplementation. A previous study showed that L-Carnitine could reduce levels of lipodystic acid in patients with Type 2 Diabetes mellitateus. However, this mechanism had never been examined in humans in controlled studies. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in any one of the hormonal profiles measured in both groups. The body fat burning effect and reduction for cardiovascular disease was investigated in human with typical lifestyle"
25317988,"The Swedish Trial In Old Patients with hypertension is a prospective, open-label study designed to compare the benefits of active and sub-injured treatment in older people with high blood pressure. It was aimed at comparing the effects of three different antihypersive agents: diuretics, beta blockers, and calcium antagonists on the risk of fatal and unfatal stroke or other cardiovascular death among elderly Swedish patients aged 70-84 years. The results showed that there was no difference in the frequency of these events between the control group and the placebo group. A first-ever acute stroke was reported in Western Australia from February 1989 to August 1990. This study aims to determine the relative risks of sudden recurral stroke over the next 5 years after an acute initial stroke. There were 351 patients who survived within 2 days. Calcium antagonist therapy is used as first line treatment for hypertensives but has little efficacy in reducing heart morbidity nor mortality. Angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitors have also been used for several years to treat hyperstensive patients. However, this does not bode well in treating young age-matched patients with low blood tension. Both drugs are superior to their conventional counterparts in improving left ventricular hyperpoisity."
19588353,"This study focuses on the effect of angioensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on blood pressure control in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The primary outcome is death from causes of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and hospitalization due to heart failure. In addition, this study compares two different antihypertensive drugs against one another in subjects with type 2 Diabetes. A total of 4,99 American Indians were aged 40 years old or older without previous CVD events. After a three-year trial, all patients were assigned to either aggressive treatment or ard treatment. All patients received either combination therapy. These patients had no prior history of any form ofCVD. They underwent double blinded rand in period; they received 10mg of ramimpril per daily, 8542 given 80 mg oftelmisaran per day, followed by both drugs. Their main composite outcome was dead from cause of Cardiovascular disease: Myocardial Ion, Stroke, or Hospitalization for Heart Failure."
26207053,"In this paper, we describe a novel approach to treating patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. We focus on the use of blood glucose-sensibility training as an aid in reducing hypoglyciaemia unawareness. This is particularly important for patients who have been underwent islet transplantations. The aim of this trial is to determine whether or not there is any difference in the frequency or severity of episodes of severe hypergycemia in subjects with type 1 disease. A total population of 78 subjects was divided into two groups: those with reduced awareness of low blood sugar and those that had normal awareness. These subjects were assigned either classes in bloodglucosity awareness training or cholesterol awarenesstraining. They were followed by six months of follow-up studies. Thirteen subjects aged between 29 and 36 years were included in this study. Sixteen people with uncomplicationd Type1 disease were enrolled. Eighteen adults with T1, including 19 children, were selected. Hba1c values were measured at baseline and after 12 months. Blood glucose awareness trainment was shown to improve recognition and control of extreme blood glutose levels. It was also found that it improved well-being and treatment satisfaction. Another test was used to assess the effect of multiple-injection regimens with 75 % Lispro and 25 percent Intermediate-acting Insulin. After three months, subjects completed self-monitors of their blood breadth and then received feedback at different levels; each level added estimations of Hbe1C, hypogemic risk, and glucose fluctuation. At these levels, they were asked to estimate their actual blood cell counts. Their response was calculated using real-time measurements of eight-point Home Blood Glycemic Profiles. For example, one group of subjects estimated his actual body count but did not report any changes in symptoms. Two other groups reported improvement in quality of life. One group showed no change in fatigue or mood during hypoplycaemia while the other group reported only slight changes. Finally, another patient education program was designed to address the problem of ""severe"" hypocrisy."
23482592,"In this paper, the authors present a cross sectional survey of European men aged 40-78 years old. They describe their general and sexual well-being in eight different countries. The subjects were divided into three groups: patients with recently diagnosed Obstructive Sleep ApneA; patients who had undergone bariatic surgery before and after weight loss; and patients without any intervention. This study is designed to determine whether weight Loss is more effective for the treatment of obese patients suffering from Ostracive sleep agitation. It was found that there was no association between body mass index and overall and cause specific mortality. However, several studies have suggested that weight reduction may be associated with improved health. Type 2 diabetes is increasingly common in the United states because of increased prevalence of sedenty and obesity. Metametrids investigates the effects of weightloss on ectorile function and blood pressure in morbidally obese subjects. After 24 months, they were assigned either to eat 'a diet- only group' or to one of three diet groups. Both groups showed significant reductions in bodymass at the end of the study."
14583958,"This study focuses on the relationship between smoking and quality of life after amyotic heart disease in patients who undergo thrombectomy. The results suggest that smoking is an important risk factor for late myosclerotic events, but there is no concluding evidence to support this claim. A prospective follow-up trial was carried out with 1432 patients from two different hospitals. In this study, we examined the relation among smoking status and health-related satisfaction after treatment for acute coronary disease. We conclude that it is not well established whether smoking affects patient's long-term health or whether they are at increased risk for sudden death. Our main aim is to examine the relative effects of smoking on mortality and subsequent changes in outcome following venous bypass surgery. It has been shown that those who stop smoking have more than twice as much risk of fatality when compared with people who continue to smoke."
26356689,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of diet on weight loss and recovery after hip fracture. He uses a novel approach to determine whether or not it is possible for older women to lose weight after surgery. She compares two groups of women with different BMIs: one group receives conventional nutrition before surgery and the other group has no change in body weight at all. The results are similar. After several days of hypothermial treatment, patients who undergo rectal rands have improved their wound health. They also report that they do not experience any complications during surgery because of the lack of mechanical bowel prep. However, these studies suggest that mild hypothecia may increase blood loss by increasing the amount of blood lost from the surgical wound. This study concludes that there is no difference in length of stay following elective colonoscopies without pre-operative mechanical gut preparation. Although some evidence suggests that postoperative feeding can improve patient health, few studies have examined the effect of eating prior to surgery as well as afterward."
28827256,"This is a cross-over study that compares the effects of two different types of treatment for adults with Type 2 Diabetes: 1) couples calls and 2) individual calls. The first call was designed to address self-management, while the second included behavior change. In this case, all three arms were focused on improving well-being. A European trial in eight countries examined the subjective well being of patients who had been treated for at least two years using the Well Being Questionnaire. It was found that there were four dimensions of depressedness, anxiety, energy, and positive wellbeing. These questions were used as controls for the overall quality of life of people with type 2 disease. An African American church-based family-centered intervention was developed; it consisted of one individual counseling visit, twelve group sessions, monthly phone calls, encouragement postcards, followed by an eight-month reinforcement phase. After six months, results showed significant changes over time in diet self management, exercise self manage, total self control, diabetes selfefficacyfor general health and complete self efficacy, physician distress, regimen distress/interpersonal distress etc. Furthermore, these studies proved that more family support may improve blood glucose control in individuals with poor control of their Type 2, but they did not show any effect on weight loss or improvement in other measures."
30666617,"The present study aims to determine whether probiotics can affect the biochemical determinants of Type 2 and Type 3 diabetic patients. Thirtyfour type 2 patients were selected, and they were divided in two groups: one group was given a daily dose of Lactobillus acid-ophilus la5) and the other received conventional yogurt for six weeks. In this paper, we examine the effects of both regimens on blood glucose, lipid composition, endotoxicemia, inflammation, antioxidant activity, as well as immune response in elderly patients who are overweight or have excessive weight. This paper is an important advance in understanding the role of gut feces in the pathomegenesis and severity of disease. It has been reported that there are many different strains of these bacteria that can be used to treat various diseases. Probiotic foods have also been shown to improve blood sugar levels in patients with Type 2, especially in those with rheumatid arthritis."
26187342,"In this study, we examine the effects on JTC and overconfidence of errors after single dose administration in healthy subjects. We compared two different drugs: L-domepral and haloperidone; and examined their effect on brain function. The first drug was a selective ancholinergic agonist that improved visuosespatial functions but did not improve memory or mental performance. This second drug is guanfrancine, an enthalpogue that has been used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder."
30426004,"Backgound This study aims to investigate the efficaciousness of N-Acetyl Cysteine, an antipsychotic agent, in patients with bipolar disorder. After eight weeks, subjects were randozed to either NAC alone or placebo. In addition, they were recruited through private and public services and advertisements. The aim of this study is to determine whether increased glutathion levels would alter the synchronization of EEGs in Parkinson's disease. We performed cell tissue culture studies with human embryonal stem cell derived midbreain dompamine as amodel for PD. All patients continued their usual care and were treated with either daily or waitlist control. To assess the biological effects of using Naci on treatment-responsive OCD, we performed laboratory experiments. Forty subject was recruited at an outpatient hospital May 12, 2012-October 14, 2014. For treating CUD in adults, all participants received curatingency management and medical management. Brain gluthathione levels seem to be reduced in schizophrenia ; if anything from 40- 60 % of persons on clozarpine experienced residual symptoms even upon adequate dosesof the medication, and thus can be considered ""clozapinine resistant."" A further paper discusses the use of alternative medicine by Australians."
22071801,"Cilostazol, an anti-platelets agent and a vasodelicator, has been used to treat patients with peripheral Arteriopathies. In this paper, the effects of using ciplopidine as claudicating agent are described in detail. The effect on blood pressure is shown in two groups: 1) patients treated with captopril for three months or 2) patients who were not treated for six months. Both groups showed significant improvement in their walking distance. A double-blindend study was performed inArgentina to confirm the efficaciousness of ticlipidine in the preventive treatment of atheothromboisis. It was concluded that biclopidiol plus aspidin would be superior to either drug alone in treating acute coronary disease. This trial was designed to assess the safety and efficiacy of both drugs in patients subjected to intermittent clamoring. Two different studies were carried out; one concerning chronic peripheral arterial disease and the other concerning sudden relapses of intermittent caudication. These studies involved 19 patients suffering from ""symptomatic"" peripheral artery diseases. They included 18 patients without any symptoms but had no pain due to persistent bowel control. After four weeks of treatment, all patients showed improvements in painfree walking time, ankle- arm systelic pressure ratio, and blood flow. Although these results did not seem to affect the severity of each patient's condition, they suggest that there may be some differences between the treatments. Another study examined the effectiveness of picotami in improving platelet function in subjects with moderately intense intermittent paddling. Picotimi improved knee activity and reduced fatigue during long periods of continuous exercise."
23609774,"In this study, we examine the effects of pregnancy and idine on children's mental and physical development. We find no significant differences in performance between women who received a high-dose of eodized or mineral oil during their first trimester and those who were not given it at all. Brain development is important for both men and women, but there are few studies to date that directly relate brain development to recurrent encephalitism."
27761306,"In this study, we examine whether the use of probiotic-containing Lactobacilus casei or bifdobacterial strains can prevent the onset of Necrotic Enterocolitis in preterm premature infants. The results of the trial indicate that the combined treatment of Bfid Obacterium Lactis and LacTobacillus Rhamnosus may reduce the risk of neonatial enterocotis by reducing the severity of disease at birth. We conclude that these studies are important because they provide early evidence for the effcacy of Probiotics to prevent nosocomic infections in very low weight babies. A double blinded, placebo-control trial was conducted on 231 preterminative infant girls weighing from 500 to 1499g at age of birth; the intervention group was comprised of 119 Infants who received humans milk with probiol supplementation, B. brive and L."" casein. This is an important finding because it indicates that both groups have different gut microbiotypes than those of term children. It also suggests that there is a delay in the colonization process of prematurous newborns due to the fact that their intestinal colonies are not fully colonized during the first 24 hours of life. Furthermore, the effects of either regimen differ greatly when compared to other regimens used in earlier studies. For example, infection rates in high-birth-women's breastmilk are higher than in infant feeds given with no added feeding. However, some studies have suggested that using bovine lactoperrin as part of anti-necrotizing prophylactics may be more effective than conventional methods."
28531197,"This study aims to translate the evidence from two large, well-recognized studies into routine community settings. The first is the Danish Diabetes Prevention Study, which focuses on preventing and delaying Type 2 diabetes in overweight subjects with impaired blood tolerance. In this trial, patients were assigned either an intervention or a controlled group of lifestyle changes. After three years, they were free of type 2 disease. A further study was conducted by Dr. Manette for the purpose of determining whether physicians' practice practices are associated with improved health outcomes."
27036879,"In this paper, we describe a population-based study of 500 patients from Southern Lebanon to determine the prevalence of mutiloskeletal pain. The results indicate that there is an adequate number of people with musculoliskeletal conditions in the region. A comparison between the use of the telemedicine program and the traditional physical therapy method is made. This study demonstrates that the accuracy andreliability of both methods are as good as those obtained using the conventional faceto-face approach."
30188512,"In this study, we examine the effects of methadone treatment on dopamin transporter function in a heroin-dependent patient population. Dopamine transporters are poorly regulated in the sagittal thalmobarbus. This is due to the fact that patients with long-term alcoholism have reduced their ability to release doparine from their central nervous system."
28854877,"This paper focuses on the impact of an incentive-based cash transfer program in Mexico, which provides cash to low- income, rural households, and conditional on receiving health education and health care. It also discusses the maternal mortality ratio in Uganda and a lack of evidence on how this can be reduced. A maternal health subsidy scheme was introduced in Pakistan in 2009; it provided free pre- and post-natal care for women who had received three or four births during the previous year. The results showed that there were improvements in the use andquality of maternal care among the poor. There is no evidence from the African regions regarding the effectiveness of these schemes. However, there are still questions surrounding design features as to whether these grants will improve maternal access to health services. In addition, many governments in Latin America have been using cash transfers to increase their public health efforts by making them contingent on people keeping up with regular health checkpoints."
24978932,"This study focuses on the relationship between stability and motion in healthy, physically active older adults. It is a cross-sectional study of 10 females and ten men. The aim of the study is to evaluate the reliability and validity of an American Academy forcerebral palsy and developmental medicine's ""AACPDM"" method for conducting systematic reviews. Four clinicians assess 24 articles for evidence and conduct. Intridution Frequent falls are evident in people with Parkinson'1s disease as the disease advances. There have no reports of interventions that reduce the risk of falls in elderly people. Acute fall prevention is important because it can alter walking habits. To prevent falling, balance training is necessary. An exercise program has been used to improve balance in older women. However, studies have shown that resistance to falls is associated with poor balance control. These studies suggest that strength training may be effective in improving balance ability in those with weak leg muscles."
19808490,"This study reevades the previous studies on the features of right ventricular Dysplasia. The second purpose was to evaluate specificity andsensitivity of the new ECG markers for arrhythmogenic Right Virgildya in the absence of a complete bundle-brack block. In this study, we assess the sensitivity with which the newly proposed diagnostic epigraphs can be used. We conclude that these markers are sensitive and specific in both patients without complete bandbb or an incomplete bandbed. Left atrial fistulia is another rare but devastating complications that may occur due to catheter ablation after atrium fibrillation. A novel oral vitaminK antagonist, ATI-5723, has been used as an adjuvant against warfarin since it is able to pass through the P450 system instead of being metabolized directly by estrases. Atrial Fibrillation Ablation: Antiarrhythmical drugs for 6 weeks will reduce the frequency of atary brachial takyaries. Preparations for acute drug trials have not yet been performed; however, propranolalol has shown promising results in improving symptom burden among patients with paroxismal attrioespital fistrutal disease. Postural Tachycardia Syndrome: Improving Symptom Burden in Patients with Posture Tachy Cardioasy. Although antiarthrotic drugs were previously reported to reduce stroke risk in patients who had paroxysmal attribution, recent reports suggest that they do not work. These include the use ofdrondarone 400mgBid for the reduction of sudden death caused from valerate /atrial Flutter in New York Heart association class II/IV heart failure. Furthermore, the effect of ICD therapy on sudden deaths caused by vaerculosis is unknown."
17488967,"In this paper, we examine the effects of low-dosage aspirin treatment on patients with acute rheumitis. We compare front-loaded T-PA and weight-ajusted Heparin in terms of their efficacy against conventional therapy. The results suggest that these two drugs have significant advantages over one another: they can be used as preventive agents for patients who have an acute coronary disease or are at risk of sudden death. A recent study suggests that adding clodipogrel into different doses to treat acute chest pain may reduce the severity of adverse drug events. However, there is no clear difference in the safety of either regimen. For example, in a stroke prevention trial, it was found that 300mg of aspidin was more effective than 200mcg daily. Another study showed that chewing aspriin improved the outcome of transient icemic attacks. This study also examined the effect of antiplatelet action on platelet functions. It was concluded that high-dose asspiin could be useful in treating patients suffering from heart attack."
31645057,"In a blinded, randozed controlled trial, infants were divided into three groups: 1) pre-term or 2) post-preterm. Infants in the control group received either breast milk or bovine milk fortified with human milk. The major end result was duration of parentseral nutrition. Preterm babies had low birth weight and no mothers to provide their own milk; therefore, they were fed either an exclusive humanmilk diet or donor milk that did not contain any mother's milk at all. This study investigated whether feeding preterm infantses with C and Ida colonies could reduce the risk of infection by reducing the amount of maternal milk given to them. It was concluded that feeding these prematurely pregnant infant girls with pasteurized mother herown milk would have beneficial effects on late-onset disease."
29633142,"The primary goal of this study is to determine whether pain and activity are more responsive in patients with a chronic knee pain condition than pain alone. In this paper, we describe the results of an irrational placebo-controlled cross-sectional trial of Celecoxib over two weeks in subjects with knee Ostearthritis. We conclude that it is possible to measure pain intensity using standardized measures such as the Pain Interference Short Form and the Patient Rereported Outcomers Measurement information system. This study also examines how well early response to physical therapy predicts outcomes at discharge. It was found that both versions of the Rol and Morris Disability Questionnaire were superior to those of four versions available for low back pain sufferers. Back pain has been shown to have an unfavorable effect on work but no comprehensive estimate exists on the amount lost productive time dueto common pain conditions."

In this study, twenty-five patients are enrolled with an acceptable response for both disease and toxicity. Twenty-seven patients were eevavable for response but 23 for toxicity. A case-control trial was performed on men aged 60 years old with prostate cancer that had recurred without any risk of death. This study also examined the association between short physical performance battery scores and falls among older adults with lung cancer. It was concluded that multidimensional geriatic assessment could be used as aid in decision making in older patients because it can predict survival and predict tolerated behavior. Elderly people suffering from lung diseases may benefit from comprehensive gaiety assessment, especially when they are older. These studies suggest that ""companionship"" between these two types of assessment will help to improve care provided by physicians."
16061898,"This paper presents a comparison of three different versions of the Time-Tradeoff test. The first asks subjects to give up time in exchange for improved health and the second ask them to consider giving it up during ten months. In this paper, the authors present evidence for the reliability of their methods as used in the treatment of patients with gallstone disease."
20459782,"The effect of oblique resistance training on physical function in healthy older people is not well known. This paper reports the results of an eight-week program of resistance exercise for elderly men and women who are over 70 years old. A significant increase in mental health score was observed from baseline to three months, but this improvement was not as rapid as that seen with control groups. In addition, changes in social support were predicted by the change in quality of living variables. Although there is little scientific evidence regarding the association between muscle strength and disability in older adults, several studies have examined the effects of vigorous activity on these two risk factors. One study suggests that walking may be associated with improved health status among older persons. Another study examines the relationship between physical activity -- which involves exercises such as walking, strength, and endurance -- and disease risk in community-living older individuals. It is found that physically active subjects are less likely than controls to develop dementia."
19433422,"This paper describes the use of neuropsychlogical testing to predict recovery after concupssion in college football players. It uses a case-control study to assess the severity of concusessions and time to recover from them. The results suggest that conccussessions are more likely to lead to injury than other sports-related injuries. A pilot study is designed to determine whether there is any relationship between symptoms, neurophysical function, and recovery time for high school students with conussion during the first two weeks after their injury. In this study, we examine the effect of head trauma on post-injury recovery. We conclude that mild head injuries can be used as an early warning of serious consequences. However, studies of amateur and professional players have not yet been performed."
22117033,"In this study, Anderson demonstrates the efficacy and safety of two different ablation strategies for patients with atrium fibrillation. The first is a pulsive vein isolation procedure that results in delayed-recurrency of atrial fibrillation; the second involves circumferential lesions. After three years, the overall success rate with PVI remains unflappable. This study furthermore examines the effect of autonomic modulation on paroxysomal atary fibrilation: Aims To examine the difference between autonocicmodification and its effect uponparoxysmal Atrial Fibillations. It was found that there were no significant changes in the severity of the disease during the follow-up period. Ablation continues to be an effective treatment for atryfibrolumation, but it is limited by high recurrent frequency. These include statins, angiotesin-converting Enzymatic Inhibitors, and Angiotensine Receptor blockers. Although these agents have not been studied extensively, they have been used as potential adjuvants against certain arrhythmic drugs."
27591931,"In this paper, we describe a novel approach to treating men with castrated-regular prostatecancer: tissue cryotherapy. We report that the use of teardrop therapy for patients with rheumatoid disease is associated with increased risk of Micturition symptoms. This study also describes an extended period of follow-up in patients who have been treated with salvage shrapnel or other curative treatments. The aim was to determine whether these regimens were more effective than conventional treatment and to compare their efficacy against standard care. After two years, the results showed no change in quality of life. Prostate-specific survival was defined as from time of death till death from disease. Biochemical disease recurrent after radical prostitutes often prompts surgery but no studies have yet established whether it is appropriate for surgeons to perform such procedures. A guideline has been published on May 31, 2016, regarding the proper adjuvant scheme for pancreatic tumors."
23499244,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective, observational study of patients receiving electroconvulsionsive therapy in seven patients with first episode schizophrenia. We examine the safety and efficacy for acute ECT in young adults who have been treated with neuroleptic medication. The aim of the study is to assess the effect of acute electrode placement on the quality of life following treatment of adult patients suffering from first-epitome psychosis. A double blinded trial was conducted in which twenty-two patients received trifluopérazine and they were assigned to receive eight or eight real electrodes. After six months, no significant differences were found between the two groups. This study also investigates the role of electrode placing in treating schizophrenia by comparing Bifrontal electrode placed in bifrontals with bitemporal ones."
29168225,"This paper focuses on the use of medicinal plants to treat anxiety in patients who undergo spinal anesthesia. It uses a double blinded, placebo controlled trial to assess the safety and effectiveness of Passifrola incarnate Linneaus as an anti-anxiety agent for patients with moderately severe anxiety. The results suggest that Passificlora Linningaus may be effective at reducing symptoms of anxiety during the initial stages of surgery. In addition, it has been reported that kava is safe and efficacious in treating anxiety; however, recent studies have suggested that this particular extract may also lead to adverse side effects."
31336032,"In this paper, we examine the effect of implementation intentions in adults with an autism-spectrum disorder on prospects i.ve memory and further explore the role of retro memory for this task in ASD. We assess the impact of ""implementation intentions"" on prospect v. memory performance in adult with autistic spectrum disorder. Twenty seven adults were included in the study and they were instructed to code their own future actions using simple PM instructions. The results provide first tentative proof for beneficial effects upon retrospective memory as well as for improved working memory ability for adults who have an A child-like condition."
25005924,"In this paper, we describe a method for assessing the potential resistances of health care workers to changing approaches for controlling malaria in pregnancy. We examine the influence of maternal and physician preference for curative treatment of pregnant women who are tested for malaria. The results indicate that they have similar preferences when it comes to antimicrobial or anti-fungal treatments. This study also describes the importance of cost attributes in patients' decision making regarding prophylaxes. A mixed-method design is used to assess patient and parent satisfaction with administration attributes of immuneglobulin therapy. It was found that all attributes included as Type and Place of Drug Administration as Well as Costs showed to be Significant predictors Of Picking between Use and Non-use of Antibacterial or Anti-Friarants Prophylactic strategies. These studies were conducted in Ashanti area in Ghana. Pregnant women tested only if negative against parasites but treated only without any risk of infection. Methods were then examined by using an estimation of willingness-to pay from two different types of drugs. Finally, these studies investigated the effect of ""framing"" on price reduction among physicians."

It is a prospective, double- blinded trial that consists of 1587 patients who have been treated with war farin for at least three months. The primary aim of this study is to determine the incidence and predictors of major bleeding among these patients. In addition, we examine the relation between Warfarin use as well as all-caluse mortality and the combined endpoint of death or admission for heart fail. We also review the relationship between war Farin Use and All-Cause Mortality; Aspirin/clopidogral: Stroke Prevention in Atrium Fibrillations Trial, which included 1,330 patients, was compared with 325mg/day asprisol, either single-blind or double Blind treatment. A reduction in crude mortality within 6 months was achieved by 40 % from the warburin group. Heart failure is frequently associated with venous disease, but the risk and benefits of anthobolic therapy are unknown."
19270759,"Predictions about development, interrellations, and possible independent of working memory, inhibition, or cognitive flexibility are tested in three25 participants. All were tested on the same battery, designed to manipulate memory independently and together, in steady-state, during task-witching ; and to be appropriately over the lifetime and for neuroImaging. The results suggest that even the youngest children can hold information in their minds, but that they will not be able to combine them as long as they remain constant. Children with ADHD show greater reward for having directed attention than those with no allele at all. This study is an attempt to characterize the molecular basis of the disease. It uses single nucleome polymorphismos to investigate the effect of TPH2 Polymorphic Variations on Serotonin synthesis in brains. In this study, we examine the effects of poly Morphotic variants in tryptophin hydroxylase 2 / TH2, the rate-preventing enzyme of serottonine'5-HT' phosphorylation in the brain. We analyze three single Nucleotides Polymorisms: SNPs -- which include the control region of DAT1 -- in 105 families with 224 affected children. Allelic associations in families without more than oneffected child was assessed by the pedigrrium test. For both studies, hypotheses could be supported that reaction times would be greater among children with higher dopamine transporteder genotypes than between controls. A birth cohort set up within MenorcaIsl and from 1997 within theAthma multi-centre infants cohort study. Mme. An early childhood observational cohort included 420 eligible children who had completed their final analysis at age four years. They used the McCarthy scales of children's abilities to evaluate motor and intellectual capabilities."

It is based on an observational review of studies that have examined the benefits of drinking green tea in relation to Type 2 disease. The authors conclude that consumption of Green tea can reduce blood pressure and improve satility in people with Type 2, but they do not yet know whether it can be used to treat other diseases."
24772264,"In this study, the effects of air-abbrasion and acid etch on the retention of sealants are compared. The results indicate that fissure protection is superior to other methods in preventing early caries. A comparison of two different types of sealed teeth is made. First, all children receive four kinds of sealing material: 1) resin sealant; 2) Naf varnish; 3) self-etch solution; and 4) placebo control. This study determines the effect of three different adhesive systems on cussuring surfaces. One system uses an Adper single bond, a second step ""etch,"" and another uses rinsing and clearfil se bond. All children get their first morals sealed with one permanent sealer. Second, they use flowable composite, which has better retention than either type of cement. Third, it compares delton or glass ioonomer as cure for pits and sills."

16286432,"In this study, we examine the magnitude of direct costs in a large sample of patients with late-stage RA. We assess changes in cost by social, clinical, and occupational factors within the first three years of disease. The results are compared to those of other patients. A cross-sectional analysis is performed on 720 patients who have recently onset rheuumatoisd arthritis. Patient characteristics and work behavior were collected by mailed questionnaires. After five years, sick leave and pensions were counted. Learning objectives: Lost productive time was measured for individual and family health purposes, expressed in hour and dollar. This paper describes the work history from the year when diagnosis to 1985. It also describes risk factors for working loss among patients With ragoon arthritis; it uses data from an observational survey of 698 patients from Northern California. There has been no long-term prospective studies of work injury in this condition."
14583987,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effect of an early-onset diet on infants' pancreatic function. He compares two different milk formulations to determine whether they can reduce the gastrointestinal Transit Time in preterm children. The first is a caseiin-based cow's milk proteolysis formula that has been used for patients with cow dairy protein allergy. This study also includes studies on asthma and food allergy; it was found that breast feeding did not improve the risk of developing allergic reactions in these subjects. However, there are other studies that suggest that early exposure may be more effective than later treatment. For example, one study suggests that using soy-peptides as antigens might help prevent childhood asthma. Another study examines effects of eating different foods on symptoms of acute disease. One study investigates the relationship between maternal avoidance of certain foods and the severity of asthma in pregnant women. A second study uses whey hydrogenlysate as an alternative to cow milk Protein intolerance because it does not cause any changes in the concentration of amino acids during the first six months of life. Finally, another study evaluates efficacy by adding three different types of animal rehydrations: 1) casesin or hydrolysed Lactalbumin 2) casein/hydrlyzed Whey Hylisate and 3) alpha-lactoglogulin."
26605535,"In this paper, we examine the effect of a custom fit valgu's knee braces and custom- made lateral wedged foot Orthotics on decreasing the internal knee agitation moment during gaits when used simultaneously with other treatment regimens. We conclude that these changes will lead to improved pain and physical function in patients with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis. A subject-specific quantity of wedge added to an ankle orthotic device could alter knee geometry to potentially reduce progression of knee Osteoartritis in people with medium-to-large medial compartmentalized knee arthritis. Twenty individuals were prescribed vouched for varus alignment by Dr. Krone; they were then given different amounts of shoe-wedges as recommended. After two months of wear, all returned to the lab for gait analysis. This study was designed to determine whether there is an immediate effect or late effect on gait in those wearing laterally wedgeped insoles after 6 weeks. The results of Conservative treatment of Knee Ostheritane are generally considered in epidemiological surveys with clinical outcome measure as primary outcomes. Biomechanical studies show that there may be beneficial biomechanical change to joint loading, however, evaluation in relative terms in longitudinal studies needs to be done"
26746590,"In this paper, we describe the effects of three-methylenthamhetamine on body temperature in healthy volunteers. We use functional magnetic resonance imagers to assess brain function in a group of ten patients who are addicted to amphetine. The results suggest that there may be some early-onset or long-term changes in hippocramal function among these patients. This study uses associative task and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to examine the effect of short-lived drug use on the central nervous system. It is hypothecated that people with high frequency of consumption have higher risk of becoming addicted than those with low frequency. A second study using multiple neuroimaging techniques has been used to determine the extent of sustained effects from ecstatic use upon the brain. These studies were performed in two independent samples of occasional amphemine-type stimulants. At first, it was reported that they had increased their use but later showed no significant differences between them. To further our understanding of the relationship between mood and behavior, several studies have been performed. One of these studies examined the natural course of ESH use and disorders; the other studied the incidence and pattern of natural courses of Emstasy Use and Disorders as well as population effects in an adult sample of young adults aged 14-25 years. They also examined patterns of mental health problems in both groups. There was little difference in the severity of depression in either group. However, most of us did not experience any such disorder at all. Although many psychiatrists administered ""Mdma,"" which was originally called Ecstasesy, as 'a catalyst to psychological therapy', over two decades later, this study became the first completed trial evaluating MedMA as part of treatment for chronic posttraumatic anxiety disorder. Twenty patients received psychotherapy with Concomitantactive active drug during two 8h experimental psychotherapie sessions. Both groups receive preparatory/follow-up Non-drugpsychotherapy.

In this trial, we compare the effects that aspirin, clodipogrel, and their combination on blood platelet  aggregateion and activity. We investigate the effect of either aspidin or cristol on platelets aggregibility using the Wu-Hoak method. Results show that there is no significant difference in the first day of treatment between control and treatment groups. Clopidogrovel is more effective than any other antiplatelet medicine because it reduces the amount of ADP-generated cell fragments. This study furthermore examines whether two different drugs can be used together to prevent strokes from occurring."

The results suggest that a high resuscitated group of children may be better able to perform better than the control group. In this study, we assess the effect of daily ibiseed oil on brain development in pregnant women with severe odamine deficiencies. We also examine whether mildly illiterate children can improve their performance when given brisk doses of imodicine."
19843330,"Acute Cand Esartan Therapy in Stroke Survivors The aim of this study is to assess the safeness and efficacy of blood pressure reduction with c and aspirin. Five hundred patients are recruited in iv, doubleblind, placebo controlled, r-and-omized, multicentre phase II study. Two hundred or sixty-four were included in open, blinded / placebo-controlled, mixed-panel trial. In each patient, they received either 250 milliliters of aspidin per day or 200 mg of nicarcine every day for 12 months. At six months, cumulative incidence of an event was significantly lower than in the only group; one patient in each groups died of stroke. This study will determine whether eprostasan will be better at preventing stroke in patients with hypertensively severe disease. Blood pressure is important because it predicts that strokes will occur. However, there is little information about how effective treatment of such patients can be."
31611064,"In this study, we report the effect of a long-term regimen of zinc supplmentation on patients with recurrent chronic hepatis C. After six months, the patients in the zinc treatment group show significant improvement in their symptoms. They also report that they have reduced the levels of aspartate glutase, AST, and ALT by nearly twofold. The results of this trial are reported in this paper. A double blinded, placebo-control trial is performed to determine whether or not low-dose zinc replacement therapy can be used for hyperammoniously induced cirrhopsis. All patients receive long term Zn containing 50mg elemental zinc per day. No differences in blood zinc levels were observed between the groups. We evaluate the effects upon interferon therapy in patients suffering from chronic HepatitisC. This study uses natural IFN alpha plus zinc to treat patients who have genotype 1B disease. It was found that all patients had more than 100 copies of the HCV virus/ml serum. There was no apparent difference in severity between these patients treated with either type of medicine."

The patients' scores improve over time and they are much younger than those who undergo conventional total hip replacement. A comparison between pertinent pre-and postoperative information relative to totalhip resurfacing would assist in understanding current perceptions about outcome. For example, we compare 50 consecutive metalmetal femorplasties in 50 patients without 44 consecutive conventional complete hip arthrocoties; all were implantedas during the same period by the surgeon, followed prospect consciously for 2 to four years. Pre-opportunely, patients had lower Harris hip Scores at the latest following up from 61.52 degrees to 105.41 degrees."" To investigate prospective patient-relevant outcomes after total knee replacement for osteoarthritis, We examined two hundred consecutive patients with primary OsteoArthritis: mean age 57, mean body massindex 71, means age 52, and mean height 3 inches taller than men undergoing traditional total shoulder surgery. After three years, there was an improved Harris score from 46.54 to 70.75 points. This is significant because it shows that patients have better pain and range of motion than their non-failured counterparts. Furthermore, surgical time has been 18 % shorter but there is less blood loss and more transfusions as well. Another study examines the effect of weight on the risk of main complications when compared to obese patients. It finds that obesity increases the incidence of major complications in both groups. However, some studies report that the rate of complications differs between obese and not sobese subjects. There is also evidence that cemented or cementless prostheses have good long-term results."

It was performed by the structure of an IHHP, which included three different clusters of r and Om-Sampling method. In this study, 3,0006 men were divided into two groups: one group received green tea or another that consumed 450mg placebo for 6 weeks. This study compares blood pressure and lipoprotein profiles in healthy adults. A sample of 16 healthy subjects received 200ml of pine bark extract per day; after 4 weeks, they were assigned to either treatment or placebo. They were then asked to drink orange juice every day for four weeks until they reached their desired levels of health. These results were compared with those of other patients who had increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Pycnicol, containing flavonoids, was found to be more effective in treating chronic venostasine than chestnut seed Extract in patients with severe venousinsufficency. Twenty-three patient's with coronary heart disease completed this doubleblind, placebo controlled cross-over trial.

27994451,"Gulliver focuses on the effects of exercise training in patients with mild to moderate pulmonary disease. He uses a double blinded placebo-control trial to determine whether he can improve lung function and patient-reported outcome after maintenance therapy for patients who have severe obstruthive pulmonary disease, which is often associated with physical limitation. A six-month cell phone-borne exercise persistence intervention was used to assess the efficability of telemedicine-based health coaching in community-delivering health care. The results showed that it was more effective than usual care for 168 patients at risk for COD exacerbitations from an integrated health system. In this study, we examine the effect of home-and-community-behavior-change exercises on physical activity capacity over one year after complete outpatient treatment. We also discuss the use of lightweight ambulatory electrodes as aids in improving physical performance in people with acute or chronic ostentatious diseases. This paper discusses the benefits of short- term exercise regimens when compared to long-term rehabilitation programs. It shows that both groups are better able to maintain their daily physical activities. However, there is little evidence regarding the effectiveness of these two different types of exercises. For example, some patients report improvement in their physical fitness during three months of regular exercise program while others report no change."
17194261,"This paper describes a study of 141 patients who have been treated with either imipramine nor fluvoxine. The mean age is 51.8 years, and the treatment duration is about 4 weeks. In this patient population, most patients are not able to respond to conventional antidepressive treatments. Most patients do not respond; however, they do manage to improve their symptoms by switching from one agent to another. A second trial compares the effectiveness of two different types of antidopressants in patients with severe depression. One group uses bupropion as an augment while the other uses buspirone as augmentation. Both groups have similar remissions of symptoms. About 30 percent of depressed women exhibit major depression that is resistance to anti-depressionant treatment. Venlafine has shown great efficacy for certain severe forms of depression in in-patients and in those presenting with resistive depression on an open-labeled basis. It is believed that these patients may be susceptible to ""concomitant"" psyche or somatic diseases. Although some studies suggest that tricyclic drugs can be used as replacements for epilepsy, no evidence exists against them. Some studies indicate that transylcomycin should be considered as additional treatment for patients suffering from Major Depressive disorder."
16539827,"In this paper, we describe the performance of an ad-managed health status measure in comparing placebo, gold, and drug-induced improvement in patients who had rheusatoidic arthritis. The results suggest that both drugs are more effective for improving their patients' health than they are for treating disease. We also examine the reliability of the American Colleges of Arthoriology's Disease Activity Index, which is used to predict disease activity in classical arthroscopic diseases. A cross-sectional analysis of three different disease activities in two hundred and thirty-three patients shows good correlation between the Ritchie articulatement index and the disease severity scores. An artificial dolorimetry is developed for the detection of joint tenderity in people with inflammatory joints. It is more sensitive than the conventional Ritchi Index in measuring degrees of pain or mobility. However, it is not as sensitive as the standard Ritche Index."

The results of these studies are described in this report. Forty anterior and anterior crown posts, 20 all composite inlays and uponlays, and 26 Venetian veneers were place in 43 patients during the initiation phase of this study. Stand and ard preparations was performed followed by Conventional Polyvinyllsiloxanie impression techniques using Cord retraction; the cement was used as place the replacements following manufacturer's instructions. This report describes three years of patient follow-up for FinesseAllCeramic All-Ceramic Crowns. Thirty posterior and Anterior crown post, 20, all ceramic inlay and onlays or 24 veneerses were placed in 42 patients at the beginning ofthis study. Stained and discolored teeth were observed. No signs of marginal discolouration or persistent pain were detected in either treatment. A long-term prospective study compares the clinical outcome of metal-fabricated fixed partial denture luted traditionally with zincphosphate cement over 20 years. It is reported that there is no sign of malignity or secondary caries among the prosthetics but one nonvitalent tooth experienced root break coupled with the broken veneering porcelain material. There is little evidence of periodontal outcomes from any of the treatments. Only indirect restorations survive after two years: Tetric / Blend-a-Lux Pertaic Hybrid Unfil, which was placed under the guidance of an experienced Dentist. These studies provide detailed information about the performance of direct and indirect restorative systems. They also discuss the effects of bone fractures on the success of different types of resin-based fillive materials."
21827522,"In this paper, we examine the relative effects of brief cognitive-behaavioral therapy for patients with chronic pain who have a history of temporomandiodism. We find that all three treatment conditions are highly efficacious in improving pain scores and improvement in self-efficacy at one year's follow-up. This paper also discusses the use of short-term CBT to treat patients suffering from acute or chronic musculoskeletal pain. It is reported that there is no significant difference in pain severity between the two groups."
23269815,"The effect of morphine on the health of older people is investigated. In this study, a daily multivitamin tablet was given to 92 elderly patients for 6 months. This trial examined the effects of high-dose vitamin B-12 with or without folicacin in subjects aged 50-85 years. It was found that there was no significant change in blood concentrations after six months of treatment. Acuponment studies were performed by two groups: one group received 1000 microg of vitaminB 12 alone or in combined with florc acid; the other group had omically assigned to receive 1,000 micrograms of vitamins B12 and 500 millimols/L as placebo. The results of these studies suggest that it is possible that low levels of folic acid may be associated with increased risk of heart disease. Although many studies have suggested that consumption of highly-fortified cereal can improve folate status, few studies report any such effect. For example, bread fortification has been shown to reduce the number of nerve tubes defects in North American adults. Consuming flour with sufficient  Folc Acid and Vitamin B 12, however, does not increase the frequency of neural tube defectes."

It is used to assess sedenty behavior in an adult population, and it has been used for several studies. In this study, we examine the effect of sitting interrupted by light or moderate intensity walking on postprar and glycemic levels of exercise. The results show that sitting interruptions have beneficial associations with cardiovascular risk markers but intervention studies must be performed to determine causality. Forty children age 4 to 6 years completed 150min room caorimeter protocol using age-appropriated pedentary / light and moderate intensities physical activities. Children wear Actigraph G1X on their hips. They are measured at both ends of each day by wrist-mounted accelerometers; they are then divided into three groups: 1) ""uninterrupted sitting,"" 2) seated with two minutes of lightening walking every 20 minutes, AND 3)'seated without two min bouts of vigorous-intentsity walking Every 20 min."""
28752947,"In this study, we examine the effects of strength training on older adults' performance on neurocognition tasks. We conclude that exercise training can improve these tasks by reducing executive control and improving blood pressure. This is an important finding because it suggests that elderly women may be able to maintain good health by taking advantage of multiple-component exercises. The authors report that resistance and balance training are superior to other forms of exercise in postponing age-related decline and injury. They suggest that core stability training, or ""Cit,"" may have some beneficial effects on trunk muscles and spinal mobility in older people."
9755013,"Neck pain is a common cause of neck pain in the U.S., but many patients persist for long periods of time without treatment. A double blind, placebo controlled trial of low-energy pulsed electromagnetic technology was performed to assess the efficacy of this treatment in treating neck and shoulder pain. The results suggest that electroacupuncture produces an earlier  symptomsatic improvement with improved neck movement, especially in those with mild degenerates of the neck spine. This study determines whether transcutaneous nerve stimulation can be used as an effective treatment for acute cervical pain; however, it does not show any significant effect on improving the patient's quality of life."
19457497,"In this study, we examine the relationship between blood pressure and functional outcome after acute stroke in 17398 patients. We compared the results of the international stroke trial to those of other patients with confirmed hemiparisis. The most common outcome is dissabling motor recovery. Although experimental evidence that stimulants can positively affect brain recovery after focal brain lesion, there are no current medical treatments available for diminishing nervous impairment after clinically established stroke. To test whether amphetine, task specific training, and limited motor experience increase motor recoveration in postacute animals, animals were not able to train in beam walking prior to a unilateral photographic sensorimotor cortice lession. After 10 days, animal models were rand and ommized to groups who received : d-AMPHEAT 2 mg/Kg 24 hafter leson; b-AMPH 2MG/KG 24 hours after leon; or groups that received either combined withtraining or combined by limited experience. Motor recuperation was maximally improved by training delayed by amphemamine treatment, but most negatively affectedby limiting beamwalking experienceDuring the recovery period, motor retrieval was Maximally enhanced by trained delay by ammonium treatment. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging was used to compare the effects of Amphinetamine on Brain activation during tone discrimination tasks in healthy subjects. This study examined the effect of AMPH on motor function in stroke patients without arm paresus. It was found that it was beneficial to use ""practice dependent plasticity,"" which underlies motorlearning in everyday life. Thus, using neuromodulating agents such as noradrenorephines, does not improve motor performance in humans. However, studies have shown that dopamine increases practice dependent polymorphism in human volunteers. These studies suggest that these effects may be due to the fact that they induce changes in the directions of thumb movements when administered via transcranial magnets."
22786497,"In this paper, we describe the results of an eight-week trial in which 102 patients were treated for two weeks with memantine 20, 20 or climpramine. This study is intended to compare the efficaciousness of both drugs in treating major depression. Major depression is frequently recurrent and treatment with antidepressives has been unsuccessful. However, several studies have suggested that serotonine ruptake inhibitor may be more effective in depressing patients with Parkinson's disease. The present investigation examines whether genetic variations are associated with improved response to serotonergic sertraline as well as noradranaline uptake inhibiters. We also discuss the effects of sleep disturbances on depressed patients."
27306431,"In this study, we examine the association between moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity and blood pressure in Spanish adlescent girls. We test whether vigorous activity is associated with better cardiovascular fitness and lower body fat among black-and-white young women. The results are mixed: moderate activity seems to be more effective than vigorous exercise for improving health-related qualities of life. A nine-month school-based intervention was used to improve physical activities and health in children aged 6 to 12 years. This included daily physical education, weekly short breaks, and daily exercises. After three years, the intervention group showed greater increases in step counts than controls over an entire week. To further our understanding of the relationship between physically active and body composition at age 12, we examined the effects of two-year changes in accelerometer measured physical behavior and sedential behavior on English children. Both groups showed significant inverse relationships; however, they did not show any change in body size or composition."
28615218,"Back pain is a major cause of morbidity in older people. This study focuses on the association between back pain and physical activity in young adults. The results suggest that there is an association among physical exercise and lowback pain in younger adults, but it does not appear to be strong enough to predict long-term pain."
28371813,"This paper focuses on the cost-efficacy of a home-based fall prevention program for older people. It compares two intervention groups: one that uses resistance training to prevent falls and another that only uses balance and tone training. The results show that both are more likely to reduce health care costs and improve quality of life than balance or tone classes. In this study, we examine the effect of community exercise as an effective fall avoidance strategy in older adults. We find that there is no evidence of improved health outcomes from physical activity alone but that it does have some drawbacks."
28614164,"This paper focuses on the use of the Functional Movement Screen, or FMS, to predict injury in competitive male runners. It uses an eight-year-old female runner as a control sample and compares the results with that of other preseason injury prediction studies. The study concludes by identifying whether the Fms can predict running injuries among elite male college players."
17164942,"In this study, we report the results of a double blinded placebo-controlled trial in which patients were assigned either to receive sertriline or placebo. After 12 weeks, both groups showed significant improvement in their PTSD symptoms. Both groups were well tolerated and there was no between- group differences in treatment efficacy. The only apparent response from desipramin was in some cases of depression; there were not changes in anxiety or other psychiatric disorder. This study compares alprazolium with placebo in patients with chronic Posttraumatic Stress disorder: ""All treatment groups improved greatly in total symptoms...and all three 'posttraumatic stress disorder clusters"". However, subtle differences are found in improvements in severity and severity on the ClinicalGlobal Impression Improvement scale. Brofaromine is also shown to be more effective in treating relapsed posttraumatic tension than it does in terms of improving symptoms specific to psoriasm. A pilot study has been conducted in military veterans who suffer from severe rheumitis. It shows that sertraline can be used as an effective treatment against typhoid fever."
21529374,"In this study, we examine the effects of eating a high mineral water on bone health in healthy post-opausalsal women. We assess the effect by drinking 1 liter daily of an acidic substance on paratthyroid hormone and bone markers. The results are mixed: there is no association between increased calcium consumption and fracture risk among men and women with higher levels of protein. This study also investigates the influence of dietary patterns on body mineral balance. For example, increasing phosphorus increases the urinary Calcium excretion but does not affect bone mineral turnover. A low-protein meal reduces Urinary Calcium Excresion; however, it has no effect on Bone Mineral Density."
28330835,"Heart failure treatment guideline emphasizes daily weight tracking for patients with severe heart failure, but no studies have found a way to track the progress of these patients. In this study, we examine the effect of remote patientmonitoring and home-based care on readmissions in patients who are at risk of death or hospitalization. We compare two approaches: one that uses telemedicine to detect signs of acute decomppensation before discharge; and another that involves nurse-implessed transitional care. The results of this trial indicate that home  TelemoniToring improves outcomes in older adults with heart failing. This is due to improved compliance with therapy and better health perception. A multi-centre, randomizedcontrolled trial is being carried out at six academic medical systems in California. It determines whether ""care transition intervention"" using predischarity education and post-dispair telephone nurse coaching can reduce readmisses and mortality among elderly patients treated with congesive heart fail. Although there has been some evidence suggesting that physician-led remotely managed care may be more cost effective than usual care, it is not yet clear whether this approach will result in improved outcome."

It consists of an open label, rand-omized, controlled trial. The primary outcome is death, nonfatual myocardiaal infacultation ion, or notfatal stroke. In addition, it identifies risk factors for stroke and their association with other riskfactors. Congestive heart failing patients have a higher risk of sudden death than those without treatment."
27591453,"In this study, a doubleblind, placebo-control trial was performed on 46 bipolar disorder patients who were treated with either lithium carbonate or topiramates. After eight weeks, the young mania rating scale showed significant decline in both groups but no significant difference in the two groups. The highest scores decline was at two weeks. This study compares the effects of an addon drug, Li+Ries, on body weight as well as serum lipid levels in children and adults with biphosphorus disorder. Both groups had similar results; however, they did not show significant differences in mean levels of fat after week 6 when compared to their control group. To investigate the effectiveness of adding to mood stabilityr therapy, we enrolled 56 biphobic outpatients from the Stanley foundation Bipolar OutCome Network who had beentreated with open label treatment. We evaluated the efficaciousness and tolerableity of new anticonvulsion drugs, bupropion sirperidone, and tricyclic overtone in bipolomania. Aeds may be effective for bipole disorder, but there are still concerns about whether these newer agents will be as effective as previous treatments."
29042383,"This paper describes the effects of advanced practice nurses' discharge planning on older patients who are at risk for readmissions after their initial hospitalization. The study focuses on elderly patients with acute coronary disease, including those with an elevated ST-serious elevation and unstable anguish. It also discusses the use of lifestyle changes to reduce the severity of heart disease in men and women over four years. In addition, it examines whether ""improved glucose tolerance"" is associated with improved blood sugar control in patients without insulin. Acute strokes are frequently fatal because they involve significant morbidity or mortality. However, there are few studies that directly relate to these events. These include: 1) community-based Diabetes Self-Management program; 2) culturally-tailored Diabetes self-management programs; and 3) patient education using telephone calls. Although this form of treatment has been used for many years, its effectiveness in improving health outcomes remains unrecognized."
26733622,"The first-line treatments for advanced, untreated, stage IV lung cancer are compared in patients with an Eastern cooperative oncology group. In this trial, we compare the efficaciousness of pembriliazumab alone to gemcitabine combined with chisplatin or pactaxel as first line treatment in advanced diseased non-smallcell lung tumors. We conclude that necitiumumabus is superior to other agents in terms of response time, progression free survival, quality oflife, and tolerance and qualityof life. NecitUMabe has been used as a stand-alone agent in several different types of malignancies, such as small cell lunglung cancer. He also describes the use of thalidiamib as maintenance treatment when mixed with chemotherapy. This study uses two arms: arm A receives liposomally cispitel 200 mg per day; arm B receive cectopan 75mg per week; and arm C receive bevacisumabu 800m/m every 3 weeks. These results suggest that halidomide will improve survival in these patients. Liposomatic chemotherapies have been shown to reduce systemic toxication by inhibiting the nexphrotoxicity caused by their antiangiogenetic effects. They further report that gefitinimabit improves progressionfree survival over stand and ard therapy in Chinese patients who have advanced EGF-mutated Non-Squamous Lung Cancer. Although previous studies suggested that adding one agent to standard-based chemotherapy would be effective in certain patients, our present study focuses on patients from 18 years old with histologiely confirmed stage IIB or III NSCLC. Our aim is to assess whether treating them with either type of regimen would result in improved survival. Pembrolinumabou was found to be more potent and safe than docetaxell in advance non Small-cell Lethargy lungcancer. Atezolimulus is an immune-checkpointing antibody that interrupts PD1 signaling and can restore anticance immunity. Nivolumamabas is able to confer improved progression-resurrected survival after four-week regimens of platinum-containing chemotherapy but does not show any advantage in overall survival during the North East Japanese 002 trial.

26769120,"In this paper, we present a novel approach to using smartphones to track the progress of bipolar patients. We develop an application for Smartphones that allows patients suffering from Bipolar disorder to daily selfmonitoring. The results suggest that it is more effective in reducing depressive andmanic symptoms than using cell phones alone. This study will also test the effect of smartphone-based self monitoring on mood disturbances in patients who have been treated with bicyclostatic treatment. A pilot study has been conducted which compares the effectiveness of two different approaches: 1) Mood Swings Plus 2) Beating Bipacity 3) by using e-mail communication. These studies are designed to assess the efficiacy of these two approaches as well as to determine whether they can be used as stand-alone treatments or as part of routine care."

The results are as follows: improvement in lung function, peak oxygen consumption, and improved health after six months of activity. In this study, Becky determines the effect of a six-month physical conditioning program on patient's ability to tolerate and respond to an acute respiratory infection. After two weeks of training, the patients improve their fitness and performance while the control group remains unchanged."
26443336,"A population-based prospective study of Japanese men aged 45 to 73 years found no association between dairy consumption and risk of prostatecancer in Japan. In this study, we examined the effect of daily dairy products on patients' prognosis of developing or contracting type 2 diabetes. The results showed that subjects consumed large amounts of dairy product but did not show any significant increase in their total fat or lipoprotein levels. Furthermore, there were no significant changes in blood resorption or appetite control. This study also investigated whether afternoon snacks could be used as an effective strategy for preventing or reducing Type 2 disease. Thirteen healthy women consumed 160 g of plain yogurt snack with low-fat content or high-content content. On day 4, they came to the facility to consume lunch. They measured perceived sensations every 30 minutes until dinner was requested."
31432431,"This study focuses on the effect of different energy loadings on appetite and antral area in healthy older adults. The results indicate that hunger is less in older subjects than in younger subjects. Aging is related to a reduction in appetite, which may lead to malnutrition. In this study, we examine the effects of three different preloads -- whey protein, glucogon-likepeptide 1, and peptidate YY -- on blood glucose concentrations and appetite in young and older men. Younger subjects consume more food than older ones; however, they are not hungry. We conclude that aging has been associated with changes in gastric distention, leading to reduced appetite. A change in secretion from CCK to GLP1 and PYy is believed to be involved in these changes. To investigate whether age affects the release of these two circulating chemicals, eight healthy old and seven younger men were treated with isoen energetically for 120 min. Plasma Cck, Glp-1, and Phyy levels were measured. After 12 weeks, 30 obese patients were given 20mg pegyalated recominant nativehuman Leptin or placebo. Body composition, energy expenditure,and metabolic parameters were calculated before and after treatments. No significant difference in the deltaor percent weight loss, percent bodyfat, sleeping metabolic rates, or respiratory rate were observed between Peg-OB and control groups. Healthy ages are associated by reductions in eating and food intake: ""the so-calledanorexia"" of aged subjects can predispense to Protein-Energemal Nutrition."" One possible cause for the anorexic of aged subjects is an increase in choleclastokinine, another gastrointestinal hormone. These effects are described in this paper. Consumption by cholecystopin is known to suppress appetite but it is unknown how this effect occurs. Whey-protein is used widely as preventative measures against malnourished people."

We also investigate the effect of very high ficose in an attempt to determine the pathophysiological basis of Type 2 diabetes. This study was performed in nine healthy but centrally overweight men aged 21-25 years. All subjects consume four different sweeten beverages: medium fruitosce at 40g/day, high glucose at HG, and High sucrose at 80g per day. The results showed that all subjects consumed three times the recommended amount of sugar for their daily energy requirements. These subjects were divided into two groups: one group consumed only 100 g of extra glucose; the other group received 500 mL of fructomedes or glucose. After change of diet, there were no significant differences in body weight or fasting blood concentrations of glutinous or uric acids. Fructoses did not lead to significant changes in either of these groups. However, they did result in reductions in both of them. A large portion of the United States' average dietary supply comes from fructons."
31076817,"This study focuses on the effect of daily doses of vitamin K in patients with chronic bone loss. It is shown that this treatment can improve bone mineral denition, but it does not lead to improved fracture risk. In addition, it has been reported that menatet Renone may be more effective in treating hip fractures than other treatments. A double blind, placebo-control trial was conducted among elderly women who had received either alfacalcol or a combination of both agents. The results showed that there was no significant difference in bone turnover between the two group. Although several studies have suggested that long-term use of vitamins K1 and D may reduce bone degradation, none have been published. Thus, the present paper investigates the effects of three-year-old male patients receiving high-dose Vitamin K2 alone or mixed with another type of medicine. After six months, they experienced an increase in BMD; their mean change was significantly higher than that of controls."

We conclude that saw palmerto extracts have an anti-inflammatory effect on serum prostate specific Antigen levels. This is important because it has been shown that higher doses are more effective in relieving these symptoms than standard treatment. The aim was to compare the effectiveness of Serenea repen + tampsulosolin with TTamsulphosin alone over 12 months for men with low urinariness tract signs due to benign Prostatic hyperplusa; there were no significant differences between the two regimens. Uroflowmetry showed that treatment by SerendoA Repens significantly improved bladder voidling and lower uriney tract conditions in subjects with chronic benignprostatic diseases. A further study was performed to evaluate the benefits of Prostate Eze Max, an oral preparation containing cucurbitapepo, epilobium parvaiflorum, llycopenate, Pygeus africanum and serpentoane roosters in the managementof symptoms of medicalally diagnosed benign prostatitious hypertrophy."

The patients were randomly assigned to receive either paroxene or st/ard-of care for their panic attacks. A majority of subjects with an infrequent panic attack received either ristodyne nor par OXIApine and were followed eight weeks. Thirteen controls with infected panic symptoms who did not have hysterical attacks underwent 35 % Carbon dioxide inhalation. This suggests that both anxiety and panic disorder may be related to hypersensitivity to CO2 but there is no concluding difference between these two anxiety disorders. Bipolar disorder frequently cooccurs with bipolar illness. Antipsychotics such as serotonine and fluvonoxamine are used to treat both conditions."

27120555,"In this study, we examine the impact of a psychological intervention on depression and diabetes in patients with moderate to mild depressive symptoms. We find that there is little evidence for an intervention that improves adherence to medication or improved blood glucose control among older African American patients who are also suffering from depression. This study furthermore investigates the relationship between symptoms of schizophrenia and their responses to health-promoting intervention. The results suggest that more effective treatment may be available for older people with Type 2 diabetes melanitus than usual care. A novel approach to improving physical health through exercise and behavior therapy has been proposed. It is reported that these two approaches have significant effects on both mood and disease severity. Although no single intervention has yet been shown to effectively treat depression, several studies have suggested that they can be used as stand-alone treatments."

He uses a combination of verbal and anecdote-based methods to assess the effects that these methods have on patients' knowledge and satisfaction about the risks involved in surgical procedures. The results indicate that both groups are more satisfied with their informed consent than they were before the procedure. This study furthermore examines the efficiacy of using an endodontic decision board to help patients make informed decisions about treatment options. It was found that patients who received either formal or informal informed consensual consent showed greater satisfaction after receiving such information than those who had only verbally consented."
25985324,"Aims: To determine whether weight loss, through exercise or a diet restriction, is associated with greater changes in circulating glucosensitivity and insulin action than does the same weight reduction through caloric restriction. This study uses blood samples from 987 patients who have no history of heart disease to examine the association between adherence to Mediterranean-type eating and higher concentrations of high-density absorbed secretion. The results are that women who adhered to an ""Middle-eastern pattern"" had lower body masses, lower total energy consumption, physical activities, and plasma levels of aponectin. Women who were most closely followed by this type of diet did not have any significant differences in their phosphorus content. In addition, they had less body weight after adjustment for time and energy intake. These findings suggest that there may be some hormonal predictors involved in maintaining weight Loss intervention is the primary non-poisonic method for prevent and treatment of Type 2 diabetes. However, little is yet known about how these factors influence either inflammation or weight gain. For example, one study examined the effects of lifestyle intervention on alterations in leptenin concentration but found no change in other markers of inflammation. Another study investigated the role of overeating and overweight in improving health measures in older adults with knee Ostearthritis. It was concluded that short term weightloss could improve endotility function as well as reduce risk of developing atherosis. Furthermore, it showed that long chain n-3 Polyunstained Fatty Acids might also improve Insulin resistance."

It is a prospective, cross-sectional study that examines the effects of chain length, degree of unsaturation, and stereoimmity on fat oxidation in normal-women. The results suggest that dietary fatty acid are less likely to cause obesity than stored ones. A comparison of three different diets was made: 1) high-carbidohydrate, low-fate, or modified-fat diet; 2) fiber-rich, high carbohidrate,low-poorish,and 3) monounstained fat diet. In this study, we examined the effect of two different types of food on body weight gains during pregnancy. One group of women were given four65kcal/day while the other group was given 52Kcal per day. Women gained an average of 9.1 mg. BMI was calculated for each gender. Pregnancies were divided according to gestation age. For example, mothers who gained more than 10 lbs at birth had greater risk of premature birth because of their higher consumption of energy. However, these women did not lose any weight when they received either type of meal. These women also gained larger amounts of weight after receiving both kinds of meals."

In this paper, the effects of metoprololil, labetalel and other antihypertinesive agents on blood pressure were compared in a single-blind, cross-over study. The results showed that all the active treatments reduced blood flow and heart rate better than placebo. All the studies also showed significant changes in lipoprotein levels after exercise. Labestal was more effective at reducing blood vessel resistance than its separate components. This effect was particularly evident when exercise was performed. Carvedalola 12.5 mg, 25 and50 mg were administered once daily to patients with Mild to moderate hypertensives. These studies examined the efficacy of these different drugs for preventing or suppressing blood vessels. They found that bendrofluzide was superior to all those tested except atenoticel; however, it did not show any apparent side effects. Bendro fluazides was equal or inferior to most of the beta blockers exceptatenolyl at restingblood pressure. Atenonel is equally or superior as all alpha-acting agents but still has its cheapness. Both labertaloL and bedarflua Zide were similar in their ability to reduce blood pumps. Their plasma levels were significantly lower than those of either agent."
29206166,"This study consists of 18 patients who have undergone a six-month program of physical activity. After the first two hours of their treatment, they are instructed to walk for 30 minutes each day. The other 9 patients undergo home exercise walkingtraining and another group receives an additional weekly gym training session twice weekly. In this study, we examine the effect of supervised case management on strength and gait speed among older adults. Aim: To assess association of measured Gait Speed with hemilysis patients' hospitalization in conjunction with recent fall history. Methods: The timed Up and Go test was used to predict lower extremity functions as well as falls risk in healthy older adult patients. We conclude that these tests may be different than those used by other performance-oriented tests such as the Berg balance or the Dynamic Gauit Index. Our aim is to compare the effects of six months of intradialytic exercises training versus regular care on health status and function in dialylysis patient population. It is hypothesized that elderly patients will experience higher rates of falls than published rates because of polypox, hypertension, and  Vascular calcification. However, it is not possible to use these measures alone nor do we know how they relate to age, gender, body massindex, etc."
29139110,"In this paper, we present a pilot study of an economic incentive to reduce HIV risk among malesex workers in Mexico City. We assess the impact of cash transfers on pregnancy and postponed sexual debut among females age 12 to 24 years. The results suggest that the program does not have pronounced effects on early marriage. However, there is evidence that it improves health outcomes for orphans by improving birth registry, vaccination up take, and school attendance. This study also addresses concerns about poverty-targeting cash transfer programs as they relate to maternal health. It finds that although there are no direct negative effects from cash payments on maternal well-being, some studies indicate that they may be effective at reducing disease in sub- Saharan Africa."
18254026,"In this paper, we describe a double blind, placebo-control study of two dihyperpyridine calcium blockers in patients with acute hypertension. Both drugs lower blood pressure adequately and are well tolerated. The safety of the first two drugs is not yet established; however, it is clear that they can be used effectively in treating these patients. Acute pulsive emergencies require immediate treatment because there is evidence of end organ damage. Nitric oxide donors have been used for the treatment of such crises. Urpidil has also been shown to be more effective than morphine or furosemidion in the reduction of severe systemic hypotension caused by myomyocardial arteriosis. Corticosteroid therapy has had some success in relieving symptoms of head injuries but has not been studied as an efficacious treatment for heart failure."
28653427,"The aim of this study is to determine whether there is any effect on adult circumcision in ejacuation parameters and the relationship between Intravaginalal Ejaculation Latency Time and Preventive E Jaculations Diagnostic tool. In this prospective, random-experimental study, adults who had undergone voluntary circumccision from September 2010 until November 2011 were studied. They were compared before and after their initial presumption of pregnancy by using the International Society for Sexual Medicine's definition of premature earculating. After comparisons with control group, the mean difference was found that men treated with immediate circumplication had greater sexual function than those without. This study also focuses on the effects of serotonein reapptake inhibitors on prematurely engorged men."
25267494,"Job rotation is a promising work-inducing strategy to reduce the frequency of back pain in the working population, although it has not yet been studied. This study focuses on collecting refuse at different job positions to determine the effect of this work arrangement on workers' health. The results suggest that job rotation may be an effective means for reducing the severity of certain musculonoskeletal complaints. A follow-up survey of 1,745 Danish workers shows that there is no association between physical load and symptoms of neck shoulder and wrist h."
26272731,"In this study, we report the results of a large number of consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous intervention and received psgrl therapy. The rate of bleeding was reduced in patients with loss-of function alleles but not in those with carriers of the major cyclopatra allels. We conclude that clodipogrel reduces the risk of major bleeding among persons who have lost their functions for one of three reasons: 1) they are carriers or 2) they do not carry the ""allele"" associated with reduction of conversion of aspirine to its active molecular metabolitism. This is due to the fact that it is difficult to distinguish between genotypes on different lines. Clopidogral has been shown to be more effective in preventing acute coronary events than either antiplatelet agent. However, there is still uncertainty regarding the efficacy effects of both treatment strategies. A prospective registry of patients treated with drug-eneluting drugs will be established at 10 -25 US and European hospital sites. These patients receive an elective chest stent and receive two or more doses of any combination of these two agents. After successful percutation, the primary endpoint is definite nor probable thrombosesis; other ends are all-caus mortality, myomyal infacultation ion, and clinically relevant bleeding. Although no studies have examined association between bleeding and anti platelet therapy, our aim is to determine whether high on-aspiin platelets reactivity can predict blood complications. Our goal is then to develop sensitivity to multiple platelite function tests to estimate the effect of such events on subsequent mortality."
15495002,"In this paper, we describe a double blinded trial of 100 identical twins taking one g of vitamin C each day for the prevention of colds. There is no significant effect in shortening their average duration of chills by 19 p.m.; however, there is evidence that some women benefit from ascorbicacic treatment. A large doubleblind study was conducted to evaluate the effect of larger doses of alcibiade on the severity and frequency of common cold symptoms. The results were not statistically significant. However, they were smaller than had been hoped. This reduction in severity was due to fewer acute illnesses caused by constitutional symptoms rather than by prophylactic measures. Furthermore, the subjects received the vitamin experienced less sickness than the placebo groups. Context Although many studies have examined the use of high concentrations or ascobic acid in treating cold disease, none of them have found any real efficacy."
17467103,"The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence, characteristics, and severity of chronic fatigue syndrome in the general community. A sample of 3,000 patients from Wichitan was characterized by no pain, ""no widespread painful"" or widespread pain. In addition, there was an increased frequency of the disease with age between 60 and 80 years. Prevalence for the condition increased with Age: With age, the greatest values attained among both women and men. This study compares two exercise morphologies -- aerobic fitness training/strengling exercises and stretching exercises -- in patients with Fibromya Syndrome--specifically, FMS. After 20 weeks, they were able to improve their physical function, pain severity, quality oflife, depression, anxiety, as well as health-related qualities of life. These results suggest that exercise may be useful in treating symptoms associated with fibroyalgiA."
24524660,"This paper focuses on the reliability and validity of measures used to predict health-related quality of life. It uses a patient- reported outcome measure, the Dermatological Life Quality Index, as compared to standardized measures for measuring health status in patients with mild to severe plaque disease. The results of this study indicate that treatment with escorts or placebo improves both functional and quality-of-lives for patients treated with breast cancer. In addition, there are significant differences between the severity of the disease and the change in the patient's health utility score. A transanal endosophical microsurgerry technique is described; it is performed via an airconduction hearing device."
32259613,"In this study, we compare the effects on a paleolithic-based diet and that of an appropriate diabetes diet in patients with Type 2 diabetes. We examine changes in weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, and glycerated haemologlobin as measures of control over type 2 disease. The results are similar to those of other studies. After two weeks, body weight is reduced significantly in the low-fat, vegan diet group compared to the conventional diet. A further study is performed to determine whether reducing dietary fat can improve blood sugar levels in newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetic patients. This study was designed to assess the efficability of consuming sulfuronylures or thiasolidinedeone for treating Type 1, noninsulin-diisable, hypertensible, or acute myosis. It was found that both groups showed significant reductions at three months' time in terms of fasting blood glucose and total cholesterol levels."
29381992,"This is a first-in-man study to assess the effect of low-fat diets on weight loss in healthy adults. The primary outcome was six-month weight change. In this study, we examine the relationship between the healthy and unhealthy weight determinants of blood pressure. We divided the patients into six groups: healthy, none of the 5 Metascomponents; unhealthy, one or moreMetS component; normal weight, healthy overweight, unhealthy obesity, and undetected obesity. After adjusting for other risk factors, such as body mass and Type 2 diabetes, the results were mixed."
17923128,"Estrogen therapy is superior to oral therapy in reducing the risk of heart disease in postmenapausal patients. In this study, we examine the effect of percutaneous transdermal or transdereal estradol on levels of prothromin and factor VII, as well as other blood-metabolism factors. Estradiola has been shown to reduce the risks of stroke and heart attack in women who are not pregnant. However, studies have found no reduction in risk for coronary heart diseases in men who take estrogen alone."
32066446,"In this study, we investigate the effects of an eight-week course of reveratrol over four weeks on patients with Type 2 Diabetes. The results suggest that a short term treatment of 10mg monacolins and antioxidants can improve lipoprotein pattern, C-react protein, and endogeneal function in subjects with T1D. This is the largest doubleblind, placebo controlled trial to date. At baseline, the liver fat contents were very large; ranged from 0.07 % to 35.55 %) but not in either group. There was no significant difference between groups: N = 54 for the intention-to-treat population; N equals 54, repertinent or placebo. A further study is presented wherein we assess the effect of polyphenolic compounds on nonalcoholicfatty liver disease. We conclude that it is important to treat these conditions by modulating cellular pathways associated with calorie restriction. Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease is one of the common chronic liver diseases in the world. Resverate has been reported as having beneficial effects on atherosculosis. However, there are only few interventional trials in humans with type two diabetes. These studies include several cases of diabetic Foot Syndrome. They also examine the benefits of combined epigegallocinatechin-3- galllate and reasveratorrol on metabolic health. It is shown that both forms of anti-oxidative stress therapy have some beneficial side effects."
28668150,"In this study, we compare the safety of leupolix acetate and depot medreoxyprogestesterone Acetate in treating endogenosis. We also examine the effects of anastrozol on patients with histologied rectogonal endometriostis who have severe pain after surgery. The results suggest that both regimens work well. For example, one group receives danasol 200mg every 8 hours while the other gets gestrinOne 2.5m/day for 6 months. Both groups are similar in terms of their severity of symptoms. After six months, laparoses are performed to evaluate changes in pain scores. Leuprolide is shown to be more effective than placebo in relieving pain caused by stenotic endomedes. This study further investigates the use of gonadotropine-releasing hormone as an adjuvant to treatment of perimenopamine-induced endorphine relapse. It was found that men were less likely to develop side effects from Gonadotronix than women were."
30377714,"In this study, the authors develop a patient-specific guide for total kneearthroplasty. Forty five patients underwent complete knee surgery and were divided into two groups: conventional instrumentation in group A and PSI group B. All patients had to undergo computed tommography of the performed knee in thefirst week after surgery; all patients received full-length anteropositionor radiograph and postoperative CT scanning. The aim was to compare pre-operative component positioning between PSGs and conventional instruments. This trial included 40 patients who had been treated with either surgical navigation or patient specific cutting guides. After three-planary component alignment and coronal mechanical alignment were determined, these patients were assigned to either control or experimental armourage. Pre-operating time was reduced by using Patient-Specific Instrumentation. There were no differences in early clinical outcome between the two arms. These results suggest that there may be fewer ""outliers"" in Alignment in frontal and Sagittal plane than with conventional tools. Furthermore, there are less blood loss and shorter surgical time when using PSi instead of conventional tool."
26231111,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the early childhood habits of children. He uses telephone surveys to determine parents' views of their children and then uses an observational-longitudal study to examine the association between young children's early exposure to television and their later health outcomes. This is the first attempt to use a longitudinal approach to track changes in children over time. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between early physical activity and later well-behaved behavior at three years of age. Although there are few studies that directly relate physically active to later emotional and mental health problems, it is clear that these issues are important for treatment and prevention"
26103637,"In this study, Anderson focuses on the use of a question-naire to predict injury risk in male soccer players. He concludes that using an exercise program will prevent ankle injuries by identifying players with previous injuries or reduced function. This study examines the relationship between activity restrictions in daily living and sport following anteriorcruciate Ligament Reconstruction. Forty subjects were involved in the study; 36 men, 14 women, age 20.616.3 years. The results indicate that participation restrictions are related to knee structures, performance-base activity limitations, and injury severity."
23250273,"Walking and bicycling to school are important sources of physical activity for children. The narrator reports that this study is an observational study designed to assess the effect of walking or bicycleing on bone mineral content and bone wideness in pre-primertal children aged 7 to 9 years. Children who went by car or train were not included, but they were measured at different age intervals. Bone Mineral Content was measured by double energy Xray absostpiometry DXA in total body, lumbbar spine, third neck vertebra, and hip. In order to identify risk factors for overweight and to determine their significance in high risk groups, boys and girls were recruited from the POM study. They were divided into three groups: 1) children with low education; 2) children without overweight or low social status; and 3) children undernourished. This study was carried out in Brazil. It was a cross sectional sample of 3,399 children and adolescents between 7 and 18 years old. Atheroscenity developed from early childhood. Physical activity could positively influence this process. These studies examined the association between physical activities and clustering of risk factor scores in children as well as derive guidelines upon the basis of these analysis."
29043392,"A novel primary care-based screening tool can be used to detect postmenopalisal women with fractures. This study consists of a controlled trial in 15 general practices within the Bristol region of the U.S., where 4264 older adults aged 50 years old and over with risk factor for falls and/or low bone mineral dentition were rand and mized to Osteocise: Strong Bonses for Life. The aim was to evaluate whether an educational intervention would improve management of patients at risk from osteoporis or fractured bones. In this paper, we describe 'Osteoprasis knowledge translation' that uses telephony reminders to improve patient and physician performance. We also report on two other studies concerning fracture treatment. One is evaluating how physicians use the fracture Risk Assessment Questionnaire to determine which patients should be reprimanded for failing to receive adequate treatment after hearing about their fracture risk. Another is testing whether pharmacists are more effective in prescribing bisphosphonizes than usual care. Finally, another study examines whether nurses who deliver training to home health care staff can reduce hip fracture risks. It finds that nurse case managers could double rate of osteoprorosis testing before and afterward compared with standard care; however, it does not find any significant difference in either medication or BMD test scores."
30782186,"In this paper, we describe a prospective study to determine the amount of prostagling material that is produced by different types of metals and polyethylene around looseened knees. The results of this study are as follows: for eighty consecutive patients, all ninety were treated with total knee replacement using an oxidated Zirconium-cobalt-chromium component. This study was followed for ten years after the initial evaluation. After two revisions due to breakage in the tial tray or late infection, no significant differences were found between the two protheses; however, there were some differences in patient satisfaction at the end of the study. A new bearing surface for total hip replacemdence has been described in attempt to reduce Polyethylene wear and improve longevity"
31528342,"This paper focuses on the effects of short-term cognitive behavior therapy and medication on patients with binge eating disorder. The results suggest that treatment of this disorder is more effective than standard treatment for other forms of treatment. In this study, we examine the predictorsandmoderatorsof response to Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy and Medication treatments for Binge Eating Disorder. We compare the efficacy of two different types of CBT: schema therapy which emphasizes early life experiences in relation to eating disorders and appetite- focused Cbt which emphasised the role of Recognizing and Responding to appetite inbinge feeding. Acutely ill patients who have been treated for food intolerance are compared to those who receive no treatment at all. These patients show improved health after four years of follow-up."
18986755,"In this study, we evaluate the efficaciousness of sil denafil in treating erectil dysfunction. We conclude that it is more effective than other forms of treatment for patients with severe or mild relapses after nerve-paring radical prostitutes. The results suggest that there may be a delay in recovering spontaneous eryection after these procedures. Post-radical retropubic prosatectomy is an excellent strategy for relieving symptoms and improving quality of life. However, many men fail to respond to this therapy because they are unaware of the specific steps involved in the procedure. This study also focuses on the effect of early pharmacical prophylaxes on recovery of spontaneous penile function following nerve sparing repertinent surgery. It was suggested that early use of propranolized alprostadas could increase the speed at which post-robotic prostaticides can be returned. A prospective, double blind, placebo controlled study included 304 men who had preoperative normal Erectile functiocity. After four weeks of trial, followed by 12 months of follow-up, 267 patients were treated with either soldenaf citrate or placebo."
21266418,"In this paper, the authors describe a study of the prevalence of ""hypovitaminicsis D"" and the effect of three months of daily vitamin D on serum-25-hydroxyvindal concentrations in Finnish girls. The results indicate that breastfed children in China have low levels of vitaminD and that sunlight exposure increases 25-OHDA concentration by causing infants to develop ricketes. A 14y follow- up of 581 young girls who took part at r and Omized control trial of milk's effects on growth were conducted to investigate its effect on adult Bone mineral content and dentility in girls aged 9 - 12 years. This study was based on comparing the effects of food-based or pill supplements with or without Vitamin D supplementation during the rapid grow period. Forty-one healthy schoolgirls were assigned to receive 1,500 IU of either calcium or 1,000 mg/d; twenty-four of them received placebo. Thirty preubertal girls were followed for thirteen months in double blind studies. Twenty-five of those were treated with 400 iu/day of any type of nutrient while 27 received an equal amount of placebo treatment. All fifty-three girls had been divided into four groups: 1) 100 girls from Caucasian families; 2) 200 girls between 13 and 16 years old; and 3) men between 17 and 63.5 years"
29018544,"In this study, we examine the effects of external focus on a repetitive sidestep cutting maneuver. We compare two types of feedback: 1) visual and 2) verbal. A total of ninety experienced female basketball players perform sidestepping cuts in three sessions. The first group receives only physical reinforcement; the second group is given only verbally. This trial determines whether or not an augmented form of attention can be used to reduce the risk of injury associated with jumping. It is unclear whether it can reduce knee stiffness caused by excessive jump force. Two-dimensional frontal plane pitch angle measurements are taken for comparison. Forty volunteers were assigned to either type of training. They were then divided into two groups: one group was instructed to jump at height while the other group received no instruction. After four months, they were referred back to physical therapy."
29326185,"The aim of this study is twofold: first, to develop an evidence-based pharmacist-led follow-up for patients with acute chest disease who have been discharged from a university hospital in Norway and then to investigate the impact of ""a quality improvement program"" that will improve patient care. This intervention involves medication reconciliation, medication review, and patient education. After three months and twelve months, the control group receives stand and ard treatment from their general physician. In addition, they are able to track changes in risk factors over time. Coronary heart diseases have declined significantly in Canada since April 1994. A prospective analysis of the population age ranges from 25 to84 years shows that mortality has declined by more than one-third between 1994 and 2006. Although numerous therapies were shown to be effective in the reduction of these risks, there is little evidence regarding how best to use these treatments in patients' lives. To increase uptake of proved efficacious medicines in such patients, we designed enacting masked patient-specific reminding at the pointof care with one page treatment guideline endorsed by some local opinion leaders. These statements may lead to improvements in primary care practices as well as improved patient outcomes. Furthermore, it is believed that multi-faceted approaches can help reduce the severity of acute myocaral infaculation ion; however, few studies have examined the effectiveness of single or multiple approaches. For example, several methods have found success in promoting secondary preventive care for postmyoCare patients without lipidlowering therapy. However, only limited evidence exists regarding what strategies are likely to work. Finally, many studies suggest that collaborative approaches improve communication among physicians and improving patient health."
31080644,"The aim of the study is to determine whether an epidural-analgesis program can improve periodic outcomes and survival for patients who undergo eshphagectomy. In this study, we report that EDA significantly reduces the incidence of lung complications from 32 p.m. to 19.07 compared with Intrvenous anasia. We also describe the results of a pilot study in which all patients underwent McKeown-style open transthoscectomy were enrolled. This study was designed to compare the safety and quality of surgery as well as length of stay in hospital when comparing two different surgical approaches. It was concluded that RATE was more successful than open approach because it had reduced blood loss, shorter Icu stay, improved lymph nodes retrieval, and better overall outcome. A second study has been published in Japan whereby rats are used as guinea pigs for treatment of malignant disease."
27124041,"Roux-e-Y gastri bypass is a promising new treatment for patients with Type 2 diabetes. However, the long- term use of IV iron has been limited. In this study, we compare the effects of an eight-week regimen of lifestyle and medical intervention to control blood pressure, glycianemia, and cholesterol in type 2 diabetic patients. We conclude that these risk factors are not entirely controlled by diet alone. A large, well-planned, double-blinded, open-label trial was designed to assess the efficacy of weight loss over six months on the reduction of major cardiovascular disease in subjects with high body mass index. The results were similar to those obtained from other studies. This study examined the effect of food restriction after two years of bariatic surgery on changes in the gut microbial population. It was found that both procedures improved the quality of the patient's colony and reduced the severity of their disease. Furthermore, it showed that laparooscopic ryb surgery had significant safety and effectiveness when compared to conventional methods of treating obesity."
27236454,"In this double blind, placebo controlled study, we investigate whether piracetantam improves the recovery of post- stroke aphases by using neuropsychological and blood flow measurements. We conclude that Piracetram has significant effects on improving language recovery in patients with severe acute stroke. The efficacy is not observed for short-term memory or for reading ability. Aphia is an important risk factor for stroke but no treatment is always available. Phoebe suggests that treating epilepsy with nootropics may be more effective than other treatments. A pilot study evaluating the effect of noostotics on brain health in stroke patients was performed. It found that noone showed any significant improvement in learning or memory after six weeks of treatment."
15674903,"The results of this study indicate that physical activity is beneficial for both men and women, but there is no significant change in exercise behavior over three months. Although the use of telephone and mail has been used to promote physically active behavior, it is unclear whether these methods will be effective in preventing or reducing long-term health changes. A 10-year followup of physical activities and self- reported health status in patients of a controlled trial of walking are presented. Walking does not lead to any significant changes in physical fitness; however, some studies have suggested that lifestyle factors like weight, alcohol consumption, salt intake, and physical movement may be important in relieving hypertension. Physician-based assessment and counseling for exercise is an efficacious intervention for older adults. In this paper, we examine the effect of ""Tai Chi"" exercise on physical function among healthy free living older people. We compare two low-coach intervention strategies for physical action adoption: 1) mailed stage targeted print material; 2) stand and ardself-help intervention; and finally 3) an individual counseling program. Physical activity seems to be especially important for elderly people because they are more likely to fall than those without children. This study uses the Transtheorietical Model to predict how individuals move from one stage to another when they begin to exercise. It was found that young adults who were initially motivated to engage in moderate intensity exercise were much more willing to do so than their peers who had previously been discouraged from doing so. However, after several months of training, most of the group's movements become back to normal."
30940176,"This paper describes an unsupervised walk program in 108 middle-aged workers at a light industrial company. Although there are no significant changes in physical condition or customary activity, those subjects actually complete the program and pool their results without regard to time. Nurses wear activity trackers on their hips for five days during which they record steps and time points. The aim is to examine the effect of different sitst and regimens on worktime sitting and health outcomes. In this study, nurses were assigned either usual sitting or one of several intervention groups. After comparing the mean change in average sitting time with that of control groups, the group receiving the intervention reduced working sitting by 113 mins/week and increased work standing time by 95 minutes per week without significantly affecting ltpa/leep Time. Prolonged sitting has been associated With adverse health outcome; therefore, these measures are necessary to promote sustained behavior change."
26658704,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of regular diabetes education on patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. He uses a mixed-race ethnicity approach to develop an intervention that improves both knowledge and self-control among African Americans who are at risk of developing Type 3 or Type 4 complications. Anderson's main aim is to assess whether physicians can provide brief health lifestyle coaching to older adults with type 2, but it is unknown whether this practice will improve their quality of life. The results of this study indicate that doctors may be more effective in improving patient health than they are in providing attentional control. This evidence supports the use of group medical visits as an alternative to usual care for patients without improvement in blood pressure, hypertension, and other risk factors."
28836492,"This study focuses on the role of fatty acids in Type 2 diabetes. It is shown that a vegetarian diet can lead to greater improvement in metabolic clearance rates than conventionally hypocalorized diets. In this paper, we examine changes in phospholipid composition among subjects with Type 2, who are assigned into two groups: VG and CG. The first group is composed of subjects from Type 1; the second group consisting of patients with type 2 who have been assigned to either veg or omily-controlled regimens for eight weeks. We conclude that whole grain consumption has several health benefits, including reduced blood lipid levels, improved heart health, and reduced risk of certain chronic diseases. Furthermore, nuts reduce the risk by reducing inflammation, haemostatsis, elevated sterols, as well as other disease-causing risk factors. Almonds may also help protect against cardiovascular disease due to their high content of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds. A recent study suggests that adding soy nuts to an omnivorously-enriched diet could improve blood pressure in patients suffering from hypertension."
15206658,"In a double blinded, parallel group study of 40 depressed patients, the mean scores for depression improved more in those taking fluoxetine. Nine of sixteen patients who complete the study and one of 19 patients reporting one or more side effects during treatment are not at alldepressed at the conclusion of the trial. A further study compares pramipexele with flicitol in patients with major Depressive disorder. Pramiproexole has significant improvement over placebo by measure of Hamilton Rating Score for Depression, Madras-And-Ganymede score, and Cgi-SI score. FluoXetine vs paronox in bipolar patients is compared in terms of tolerability and efficacy. Both groups have significantly lower means on the Hamilton rating scale for Major depression; however, they do not show any differences in severity or duration of treatment."
26118568,"A prospective, irregular, single-study study comparing the benefits of direct anterior approaches to posterior-lateral approaches for total knee arthrooplasty. The subjects performed better in the immediate postoperative period and had lower pain scores than those who underwent conventional approaches. Although other studies have found no significant advantage over these approaches, there are still unproven disadvantages. In this study, we compared the learning curve between experienced surgeons with different tissue sparing techniques for complete hip replacement. We compared the three different approaches: tertiary with mini inccision, minimally anteroward, and miniaturely apprehensive anterso-latéral. Results from all three groups were similar except for the difference in time and complications after 6 weeks. This study is important because it will help us determine whether or not newer surgical approaches can be used to improve patient recovery."
25236305,"In this study, we examine the effects of three months of a high-fruit, vegetables, and low-fat dairy diet on blood pressure in prehypertensesive children. The results show that the daily dose of either drug is superior to the routine outpatient nutrition care provided by hospitalized patients. A double- blinded, parallel- group, active-control trial compares the safety and efficacy for valsaran with amalodipine; it has been reported that there is no significant difference in the risk of adverse reactions between the two regimens. Losartans reduces blood flow in children aged 10 to 16 years who have severe hypertension. This study determines whether dark chocolate can be used as an effective treatment for children with elevatedblood pressure. Children are divided into two groups: 1) school-based intervention or 2) control groups. After seven weeks, students were assigned to receive one of four different doses of light chocolate each day. They had similar reductions in their blood pumps from baseline to follow-up. Both groups showed similar changes in BP over the course of the study period. Although both studies found that losartan was safe and effective, they did not find any evidence of increased risks of heart attack or death in these subjects."
17943736,"The effect of lipid replacement on peripheral artery disease is described. A double-blindend, placebo-control study was conducted in 286 Spanish patients with leriche-fontainestage II peripheral arterial disease. After 27 weeks, the primary endpoint was the double of the painfree walking distance after treatment. This was achieved by 28.3% of those treated with either sullodexine or fish oil. In this study, we examine the effects of an extra virgin olive and afish oil supplement on plasma composition and suscibility of lipoprotein fat content. We also investigate the effect that probucol can induce on atherocities in hypercholesteremia. Probucolo does not induce regression during the three-year trial period estimated by changein lumen volume upon quantitative arterisography. Furthermore, it has been reported that protegelic acid reduces HDL particle sizes as well as increases the relative size of both groups. These results justify the use of proteges in the treatmentof lower limb arteriosclerosis. Two years of high-dose polyunstained fatty acids were studied in 30 patients who had low-end vascular disease; they were divided into two different groups: one group received colestipol Plus nixacin plus diet, and the other received placebo. Both groups showed significant changes in their blood cholesterol levels but no differences in exercise time. They did not show any difference in heart disease or stroke. To date, no secondary preventive trials have been conducted specifically for men with lower arm arthrosclerotic conditions. No new antithrombotics are currently available to treat these patients. However, there is little evidence against using statins in treating them. Ciprosol improves walking speed in patients without intermittent clacudication. Policostasanola decreases total cholesterol while improving the risk of cardiovascular events in people with moderately intense intermittent caudicure. Antiplatelet therapy is useful for relieving symptoms of peripheral circulatory disease such as atheromatoius diseases. Lipid-lowering drugs like prava Statin and simvastin are more effective in decreasing the risks of coronaries and stroke than conventional methods."
26027632,"The aim of the study is to determine whether an exercise program length can improve walking time in patients with atheroseclerotic, peripheral arterial disease. In this study, a patient group consisting of 106 patients and 27 control groups was assigned to supervised or usual-care exercise. After six months, subjects had improved their walking speed and graded as tolerated. A further study was performed on patients who had been treated for intermittent claudicility due to ""femorostopopliteals disease."" This study compares the effects of home-based exercises on quality of life and ankle pressures in people with paternal artery disease; it was found that these patients were more likely to be able to walk longer than those who received conventional exercise training."
28294172,"In this study, we examine the effects of drinking blackcurrant fruit juice on oxidation stress and vasomobility in patients with acute coronary disease. The effect of short-lived ascorbicic acid treatment on flow-mediated Dilation of the Brachial Aorta is studied in 46 patients who have angiographicalally established CAD. No significant change was observed between Vitamin C and placebo administration in fasting blood glucose, serum cholesterol, trigglycerides, and glycosolated haemologlobin concentrations. We conclude that exercise-induced peroxidative stress may lead to atherosis in Type 1 Diabetes mellitateus. This study uses a doubleblind, placebo-control design to assess the influence of 1,500 milliliters of vitamin C every day on endurance performance in runners. Both groups maintained an intensified heart rate during the race; they also showed increased plasma ascotbic acid levels. These results suggest that high-dose antioxidants may reduce the risk of Type 2 Diabetes."
31095078,"In this paper, Pollock demonstrates that short-burst exercise can be as effective as long-bore exercise in improving body composition and fatness in Latinos. He also suggests that using short burstries of exercise may lead to improved weight loss in older adults."
21127200,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of ergonomics on upper-limb pain and injury. He describes a group of office workers who have been assigned to different groups of exercises or workstations to improve their symptoms. The results of these studies indicate that there is an improvement in pain severity after six months of use of the newer type of keyswitch technology. This study also suggests that stress management may be beneficial for patients with lateral epicodondylitis because it reduces the risk of future disability. Anderson concludes by stating that ""workplace factors were assessed with question ennects at the Time of Inclusion"" and that all patients receive follow-up from 3, 6, and 12 months. A structured examination schedule is developed for the diagnoses of muskuloskeletal disorders within general practice. An assessment schedule was developed as well; however, only 43 subjects had complaints of specific lower limb injuries. After two years, they were divided into three groups: one group received regular breaks and another one intervention group took extra breaks. These studies investigated the efficacy of outpatient multidiscretionary treatment for sicklisted workers with no specific upper arthritis. They concluded that the return to work program provided improved work stability among Swedes than among immigrant workers. However, the rehabilitation offered did not result in improvements in work performance among immigrants."
26972954,"This study focuses on the effects of short-term, long- term education on patients with Type 2 diabetes. The aim is to determine whether an individualized outpatient program for functional insulin treatment can improve perceived control over disease and health beliefs. In this study, physicians receive brief educational messages that are added to their laboratory test reports in order to improve patient care. After six months, the results show significant improvements in blood pressure, glyciaemia, and other measures of health. A multi-component intervention was designed to reduce the risk of death, morbidities, or risk factors for patients newly diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes. It consisted of regular follow-up and individualized goal setting supportedby prompting of doctor, clinical guidelines, feedback,and continuing medical education. Although there were no significant changes in Hba1c at three years after the initial trial, these results suggest that the quality of medicine may not be improved by a single approach."
17010257,"In this paper, we report the results of a double blinded trial of iron-supplements on anemia, weight, and height in three different groups of schoolchildren. The effects are not significantly different from the daily or weekly doses; however, there is no difference in body weight or height. Iron-based supplements have been suggested as replacements for daily iron pills for reducing Anemia in developed countries. Children receive either Albendazol or Ferrous Sulfate at least once every week or placebo for 16 weeks. A doubleblind, placebo-control iron supplementation trials were conducted in India to examine whether iron can improve blood Fe status and physical growth among children aged 3 - 6 years old. Both groups received iron fortified food with reduced iron or without dewormer. This study was designed to determine whether combined iron and zinc could improve iron status but did not lead to improved growth. It was concluded that infants fed multiple formulas early in their lives were susceptible to stooling abnormalities because they perceived them as being more sensitive to gastrointestinal symptoms than they were to other forms of feeding. Although these studies suggest that iron may impair growth, it has not yet been proven that such regimens would be effective. For example, one group of children received 12 millig iron per day while the other group received only 1 mg/day. After six months, the children gained significant weight gain and increased their height by 2.4 kg."
27273067,"This study aims to compare the effects and changes of a reduced-saturated fat diet with that of an all-vegetable diet. In this study, we examine the effect of two different sources of fiber -- barley and rice bran -- on blood pressure levels and lipid concentrations in hypercholesteremic Japanese subjects. The results suggest that consumption of both bars and wheat can reduce total and LDcholesterol levels but not as much as those obtained by other means. Barley has been used for several studies to lower blood cholesterol levels, but it is not widely consumed in the United States."
28107561,"In this chapter, the authors present a series of studies on the effects of anti-hypertensesive agents on hypertension. The first is an African American study in which patients aged 70 to 84 years old were assigned either CAS or NCAS. This study compares the effect of metopropol 1, 6,09 as initial treatment for blood pressure reduction in stroke and other cardiovascular deaths in Swedish patients with untreatedd diastonic/blood pressure between 180"" and 230"" mm HG. These studies are followed by two more studies that aim to determine whether metoropolil will lower the risk of coronary disease in older patients who have not yet been treated for their hypertension. Finally, these studies examine the use of calcium antagonists and angioensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to prevent heart failure in elderly patients."
25164349,"In this paper, the authors describe a prospective study of patients with gallstone disease who undergo laparoscopic or minilaparotomy. The results of these two procedures are compared in terms of pain and improvement after 24 months. Laparcotomies are recommended for those with bilary tract pain, but there is no clear evidence that they can be used as an effective treatment. A blindeded rand omize singlecentre trial compares the cost-utility of open cholangitography to that for conventionally managed acute gallblader disease. This study determines whether waiting and see is justified in some cases when patients have symptomatic stones. It also assesses how long it will take for patients to recover their symptoms after surgery."
25865603,"The aim of this study is to assess the validity of a validated patient-recording system, the Toronto Clinical Scores, in assessing the severity of patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. In addition, all patients were asked to complete three different questions: the Michigan H and outcome Questionnaire, ""the Disability of the Arm"" and ""The Disarmities of Touch"" score. All question answers were reproducible but less valid for finger or wrist disorders than nerve disorders. This study also examines the relationship between quality of life, depression, and disability among Charcot-Merchant disease patients. A multi-centre observational cohort was used to determine which are the most important tests that are related to pain intensity. For example, we examined the reliability of Semmes Weinstein's monofilament test in 15 patients who had Charcott-Marie-tooth disease. Also, there was good interobserverreliability on the SWMF scale as well as the relation between loss of intrinsic muscle strength and dextersity. Finally, an assessment of chronic pain was performed in 160 patients aged 60 years at four US study sites. These patients completed the ZBPI, McGill PAM, EuroQOl, Short-form McKell Pain Question Observer, Quick-Form McGil Pain Question, Numeric Rating Score-Paink Intensation, NRS- Pi, Adlib, Viola, Biondynia, etc."
30187695,"In this study, we examine the effects of long-term high intensity weight bearing exercises on the rate of joint damage in patients suffering from rheuumatoisd arthritis. After two years, the results show that the exercise group develops less injury than the control group. This is an important finding because it suggests that physical therapy may be more effective in relieving pain and improving quality of life for patients with axspondylism. The primary end of the study is to compare the effect of endurance and strong exercise on disease activities and CV health among patients who have active spasticity. We find that exercise induces marked changes in blood cell count and tissue composition as well as improvements in spinal flexibilities and posture. Furthermore, these changes are highly dependent upon the patient's disease activity."
25456506,"In this paper, the authors describe a novel approach to treating patients with atrium fibrillation. They focus on two specific problems: 1) isolated atrial fibrilation and 2) patients who have severe left-ventricular dysfunction. The first problem is that they do not know how to ablate these patients effectively. Second, there is no evidence of any benefit in using pulmonary vein isolation as an alternative to medical rate control in patients suffering from heart failure. Third, we examine the effect of single-centre ablation on left valvular function in congestive hearts failing. We conclude that it is difficult to predict whether long-term improvement in left ventricle function will be obtained by single centrecy or by continuous medical treatment."
14576382,"This paper describes the safety of a calcium antagonist-based blood pressure reduction regimen for patients with acute stroke. It also discusses the use of perindopriml as an anti-recurrent stroke treatment. In this paper, we describe the results of two prospective, double- blinded, placebo-control studies that assess the effects of different types of therapy on risk of stroke and mortality in elderly patients. The first study is aimed at reducing blood flow by using an angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitor to block the action of beta blockers. A second trial is designed to compare the effect of conventional or newer antihypertensive treatments on total heart disease. These trials are divided into three groups: 1) primary prevention 2) secondary prevention 3) multifactor intervention. After all, it's difficult to know how effective these drugs will be in treating hypertension."
28264715,"This study aims to determine whether patients receiving ""rate-control"" drugs have a better survival than those without them. The results of this study are as follows: 1) there were 43 878 patients with atrium fibrillation in the groups received &bgr, blockers ; 2) calcium channel blocker, digoxin -- respectively. 3) no active screen took place in controls practice. In addition, the main outcome measure was newly identified atrial fibrillation. A comparison between lenient versus strict rate control II trial and also to assess the roles of dignoxin to achieve heart rates targets ). Atrial  Flutter has been used as an indication for its distinctness from other arrhythmian diseases. Although few epidemiological cohort studies have examined attrition flutter, it is important to note that scant information is available for long term outcomes in individuals abroad."
23927840,"Heart failure treatment is based on daily weight measurements in patients who have advanced heart failure. The results of this trial suggest that daily reporting of body weight and symptoms may reduce the risk of hospitalization, readmission, and mortality for patients with advanced-stage heart failing. A case management program was developed to improve patient education and compliance. In older adults with multiple illnesses, it is believed that routine care can reduce their morbidity but no studies have examined its efficacy for improving quality of lives. Telemedicine has been used to prevent frequent hospital admissions as well as to reduce costs. This study compares the effectiveness of two different approaches: 1) home telemetry using an integrated ECG device; 2) nurse telephone calls; and 3) usual outpatient medical care. These three approaches are compared to one another in terms of improved health status and cost. They also assess whether nurses' use of remote technology could be effective in preventing death or admission among patients suffering from chronic heart fail. Although these studies do not directly relate to disease management, they provide important evidence regarding the value of such services."
30283040,"In this study, we examine the efficaciousness of a carboxy-methylcellulose membrane to prevent post-opportunity in rat urethria. We compare nineteen injured torseal horns treated with it and 19 untreated udders without treatment served as control groups. This study is an attempt to evaluate the effect of sim vastatin on reduction of epidural wounds in rats. The rats receive aspirin at three different doses per day for eight weeks. These studies are followed by two double blinded controlled studies: one concerning rats that have laminectomy after traumatic lesions; and another concerning patients who have elective colored resection but receive no pre-operative drug. They are then divided into four groups according to their severity of scar formation. A single daily dose of aspidin was given to each group before surgery. Post-Opposon Adhesion Formation in Rats Following Laparoscopic Urine Osteoartitis has been reported implicated as one of several factors that lead to continuing or repeating radicular pain."
32274957,"In this paper, Dr. Manette focuses on three hypotheses: 1) people seek out alternative medicine because they are dis satisfied with some way with traditional treatment; 2) they see alternative medicines as offering more ""personal autonomy and control"" over their health care decisions; and 3) the alternative treatments are seen as being more compatible with patients' values, worldview, or beliefs about the nature of illness. He concludes by stating that there are three primary hypotheties that predict future use of alternative medical treatments in men with prostatic symptoms. First, to assess the effect of Saw palmeto on urinarry symptoms, sexual function, and Urinary flow rate in Men with lower Ury tract symptoms who were 45 years old or older. The eligible subjects were treated with either saw-paletto for six months or placebo for one month. After completing an initial trial, 85 men received either solution. A mean symptom Score was improved from 16.7/ 12.3 in group-treated group to 13.6/ 15.8/ 12.6 in groups-controlled group. Per mixon, the liposteroic extract of Serenneoa rpens, is widelyused for the treatmentof symptoms associated with Benign Prostatic hyperplasa. This study evaluates the efficaciousness and tolerableness of permixon 160mg twice daily for two years. One hundred 50-five men had clinically diagnosed Bophism and complaints of profuse symptoms were recorded at 6, 12, 12 & 24 months. Adverse event events were measured every 3 months."" To compare the effects of a combination Tamsullosin + Serenonea Repens with placebo against each other in patients with low Uriy Trch symptoms due to Bennical Prostasis, we performed dummy studies. We concluded that both regimens did not have any significant difference in efficiacy or tolerance between them. Second, it was found that serenoal repens could be superior to finasteide in terms of improving urine flow rates. Third, although Selenium seems to have similar effcacy, its efficacity has been questioned at least at doses ranging from 0.4mb/d to 320mhd. Finally, after examining the results of several different trials, Contextt suggests that saw palmerto extract can be effective at up to three times the usual"
28899233,"The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the utility-based measure of quality of life, or EQ-5d, for determining the minimally important difference between death and Optimism. This measure is used as a stand-alone measure that can be used to establish the ""minimally critical difference"" between mortality and healthfulness. In this study, we examine how physicians value the patient's health when compared with those of patients who are described as veterans. We also examine whether residents' perceptions about the health of their patients differ when they are presented as an actor in one of two groups. Acute heart failure, particularly congestive, is very common in developed countries. Heart failure is especially difficult to treat because it involves fluid accumulation. Therefore, there is no easy way to assess the efficacy of these measures."
26442959,"This paper describes the use of a new technology to improve blood glucose control in type 2 patients with Type 1 mellitateus. It uses voice-interacting technology, which allows physicians to send bloodglucometers and results directly to their patients. In addition, it provides immediate advice on how to manage changes in diet, exercise, stress, and other lifestyle events. A pilot study was conducted in Germany to evaluate whether adding telemedicine coaching and patient-provider Web portals to primary care vs."" stand and ard disease management would reduce Glycated Haemogloin levels over an 1-year treatment regimen. The main endpoint was change in patient reported diabetes symptoms, diabetes distress, depression, laboratory test values; and treatment satisfaction. Telemedicine has been used for improving health outcomes in many chronic diseases but few large trials have examined its efficacy. For example, we investigated the effect of weight reduction after diagnosis by using telephone-based self-management programs. We also evaluated the effectiveness of short message service ""Short Mess Service,"" which sent messages via cell phone and the web. These studies were primarily designed to assess the effects of these services on patients' health status and quality of life."
30463585,"In this study, we examine the effect of a child care provider-taught physical activity program on children's behavior. Children in the intervention group show fewer hours of school and less time spent outdoors. The results suggest that an outdoor exercise program may be more effective than traditional indoor playtime for improving health and learning. This paper presents evidence for the use of short periods of structured physical activities to improve daily habits among prekindergars. It is shown that short bouts or ""structured"" exercises are associated with improved physical performance in young children."
28796127,"This study focuses on the association between injury and risk factors in young men entering the military. In this paper, we examine whether hip muscles strength and flexibility influence injury risk in airmen who are training for the National Hockey League. Athletics are common among soldiers, but little has been known about their role in injury-prone individuals. We use a preseason fitness assessment to determine whether or not running shoes that are made of plantar shapes influence injuries in male and female Air Force basic military training recruits. The results show that women have fewer injuries than men because they do not take an initial physical training test. A one year prospective examination of injury risks and injury predictors is conducted in the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Soldiers experience only one or two injuries during their first year of service; however, most of them are related to training-related problems. Women's injuries are more likely to be associated with time loss than those of men. Pretraining surveys are performed at the start of each student' school year to assess how well students respond to injury questions."
20687074,"The aim of this paper is to compare efficacy, safety, andtolerability of antihypersive agents in patients with end-stage kidney disease. In addition, the results of several large studies have revealed that angiotension-converting enzymes, ramispril, dihydrophosphodiec acid, or beta blocker are superior to conventional antihubertensive methods for reducing blood pressure. This paper also discusses the use of alpha1 inhibitors as first line treatments for hypertension. A double blinded open-ended trial was conducted in Norway and Swedish patients aged 18 to70 years with hypertense renal disease who were assigned either acalcium antagonist strategies or nisperdipine atenosolol. After two weeks, patients on betablockers entered m andatory 2-week washing out period before being let in the placeborun-in period. The Norwegian Diuretic Arterial Atheroscraps Study is designed to evaluate the effect of calcium antagonist treatment on reduction in left ventricular mass over time. It has been reported that amalodipines may be more effective than other drugs because they do not cause any side effects. However, there is no concluding evidence that their use increases the risk of heart attack."
25365192,"This study focuses on the relationship between hypercalcemia, which occurs before and during treatment for hypothyroid patients, and the effect of daily doses of 25-hydroxyvitamin D on children with asthma. In this study, we examine the association between vitamin D levels and disease severity in children who are not treated with L-thryroxine. There is a significant increase in the number of children that receive no treatment at all from either group. However, one child does not show any signs of deficion. A further study is performed to determine the relation between blood levels of both vitamins and influenza. The results indicate that there is an increased incidence of influenza in schoolchildren who receive 200 IU of vitaminD per day than in those who do not receive it."
22617117,"This study focuses on the effects of home-based intervention on health-related quality of life after chest artery bypass surgery in patients with confirmed heart disease. The results are mixed: there is no significant improvement in patient's health after two years; few programs improve patient behavior, health, or qualityof care. In Florida, the LifeMasters supported SelfCare program provides self-management services to Medicare beneficiaries who have congesive heart failure, diabetes, and coronary artificial diseases. Although this program reduces expenditures by 9 percent, it does not increase overall use of hospital or emergency rooms. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluates the effect of a lifestyle-oriented approach on risk factor reduction for patients suffering from acute myomyocardial arteriosis. After six months, these patients show improved changes in their lifestyle as well as improvements in blood pressure, body massindex, weight, exercise capacity, pain, sleep, etc. These studies provide evidence that ""life-centered secondary prevention"" can be used to prevent long-term adverse events from occurring."
30872787,"Vitamin D insufficient hip fractures is common among immigrants, but this study focuses on whether combined daily calcium and vitaminD can improve the health of children. In this trial, ninety five patients with 25-hydroxyvinmin D-25Nmol/L had been assigned to either ergocaliferol or chollecalcifarerol for three months. The results suggest that these two treatments are more effective than sun exposure in improving their health. A double blind, placebo-control trial was conducted in healthy young people aged 18-29 years living in Lucknow, India; latitude 26, °N. During winter and spring, pregnant women were divided into three group: control group, no vitamin D2, 125 nmolg/day, or 250 ng/d; all receiving 500mg of calcium. This study examined the effect of pregnancy on bone mineral dentition, infection, and anemia. Pregnancy affects maternal bone mass during pregnancy. Both groups lose significant amounts of body weight as they receive higher doses of both types of treatment. These studies aim to determine whether highdose v's sat and ard doze off upper respiratory tract infection in men. Although there is some conflicting evidence regarding the efficability of low-Dose-Old regimens, we conclude that it is best to use only one type of regimen because many differences exist between European and American diets. We also examine the effects of different levels of blood concentrations from Arab and Indian females who live in the U.A. Embarked from South Asia, Middle East, Africa, Latin America, Turkey, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, China, Mongolia, Turkmenistan, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Hungary, France, Italy, Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Russia, Georgia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, Romania, Macbethia, Northumberland, Scotland, Ireland, England, Belgium, Netherlands, Holland, New York, United States, Canada, Mexico, Alaska, Nebraska, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Washington, DC, Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, West Indies, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Wyoming, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas, Connecticut, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Montana, Colorado, Nevada, Idaho, Michigan, Alabama, California, Hawaii"
24652601,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of music therapy on children with an ""autism spectrum disorder"" who are assigned to either joint attention or symbolic play. The results indicate that young adults with high-functionality report less loneliness and improvement in social skills while their caregivers report significant improvements in overall social skill, socialresponsiveness, and empathy. This study also uses a controlled trial to assess the efficiacy of Early Start Denver's Social Skills Intervention for children aged 3 to 4 years old. Children with autus exhibit significant delays in imitation skills; however, these areas have been studied in other studies. Although many studies have suggested that early intervention for social communication may be effective, few trials have yet been conducted. For example, one study suggests that using improvised music treatment to improve social behavior in children suffering from autism is more effective than traditional parent-centered approaches. A second study compares two forms of social stories to those used to teach children about emotion recognition. It shows that children can learn more when they are imitated by adults rather than just playing with children. Another study examines the effect of expert training on teachers of children without having had experience with child-in-fancy techniques."
28387560,"This study focuses on the use of neurocognition to predict concussession severity in college football players. It is a prospective, controlled study designed to estimate the frequency and severity of acute sport injury in male and female college students. Athles underwent pre-season baseline assessment measures using the King-Devilick test, an instrument used to measure rapid number naming, the St and Arised Assessment of Concurssion, and the Postural Stability Measures. The results of this study suggest that concoussed players may recover quickly after their injury."
21835653,"In this study, we examine the pain and behavioural features of headache patients who have temporomandiol disorder. The subjects are compared with controls for their pain, tooth contact, emotional states, and stress. They report that they receive an RDC-TDMD diagnosis of their headaches. This is the first time that such a highly regarded tool has been used in the medical community."
30264226,"This study focuses on the effects of acute exercise on attention-defiant hyperactivity disorder in children. Forty patients with ADHD were assigned into either an exercise group or a control group. The results indicate that acute exercises improve executive function in both groups. Acute exercise is particularly effective in improving symptoms of attention deficit hyperaction disorder, which affects academic performance. In this paper, we examine the effect of medication management and behavior therapy on several primary outcome measures, including: attention deficit hyper activity disorder; oppositional defiance disorder -- ODD; symptoms; social skills; reading scores; impairment; and diagnostic status. At three years, 485 subjects had completed their follow-up at 10 to 13 year old age. We examined by using Conners' Continuous Performance test, ChT, and the Change task, an extension for the Stop Signal test. Both treatments showed significant improvements in treatment for commission errors, snoring, attentiveness, slow reaction time, etc. These studies suggest that multimodal therapy may be more effective than other approaches because it can address many of the physical and psychological needs of children with excessively high levels of self-regard."
27390451,"This study aims to determine whether exercise can be used to prevent falls in people with mild-to-moderately severe Parkinson's disease. Two hundred 30-one patients are randomed into exercises or usual care control groups. The primary outcomes are fall rates, proportion of faller during the intervention phase, and physical: balance,mobility, frozen gait, habitual bodily activity, psychological / fear of falling, affect, quality of life measures. In this study, we examine the efficacy of an Irish set dancing program on improving balance and functional ability in persons with moderate-diseased PD. We also assess the effect of four-week chair transfers on postural control for patients with advanced disease such as PS. A novel form of therapy called neurofeedback is employed to improve balance problems in subjects with a type of progressive disease known as iDiopathic Parkion. Although there have been few studies that evaluate these effects, it is clear that resistance training may be effective in treating symptoms of pd."
28854319,"The aim of this study is to determine whether feeding at two-hourly or three- hourly intervals reduces time for infants to reach full feeds. In preterm, very low birth weigh babies, the risk of developing necrotizing Enterocolitis is greatest after being fed. Although previous studies have suggested that enteral feeding delays the development of Nec, current evidence suggests that early versus delayed feeding can be used to delay the disease. This study compares the effects of rapid and slow advancement of enterals on long-term health outcomes in prematurely weighed infant girls. Aim: To examine the effect of fast and moderate advance of entryal feed volume on growth and neurodegeneration in extremely lowbirth-women. Types of feeding practice are associated with an increase in the incidence of Nec; furthermore, it has been shown that high-volume feeding regimens may lead to more frequent complications."
24214202,"Roux-y gastric bypass, or laparoscopic rigid b and eating, has been used to treat morbidly obesity. It is now considered the gold standard for treating such patients. In this paper, we examine the effect on blood pressure in a group of 100 patients who had undergone LRYGB for one year. The results showed that weight loss was significantly reduced compared with open surgery. This study also examined the association between weight gain and other risk factors after surgically induced weight reduction. We conclude that Laparooscopic rybgb can be used as an effective treatment for both type 2 and hypertension."
28379397,"This paper describes a novel approach to improving patient self-regulfment in patients with Type 2 diabetes. It uses an evidence-based, problem-solutioning interview to assess the skills of adult patients who struggle with their own health regimens. In this study, we examine whether adding telemedicine and patient-provider Web portals to primary care would reduce glicated bloodglobin levels among patients suffering from type 2 disease. A pilot study was performed on two hundred forty- four subjects with low health Literacy levels in ten public health centers in Chicago, Illinois. The results showed that patients had improved their quality of life when they were assigned to either intervention condition or attention control condition. Both groups received better treatment than usual care. We conclude that ""culturely appropriate"" approaches are needed to help Latinas improve their health."
28434446,"A prospective, i.e. single-centre study of two different ablation strategies for patients with atrial fillation is presented. The first involves a combination of pulmonary vein isolated and left-atrial linear lesions. In this study, the long term success rate of either procedure is 62 p.m. in the PVI alone or additional linear lesion group. After comparing these two abations schemes to those performed by other methods, it is concluded that both methods are superior to one another in terms of their efficacy."
27454460,"In this study, we examine the results of a single-gingival recess treatment using bilaminar flap and coronally advance flap. The results are similar to those obtained with either technique. A further study is performed on patients with multiple recessions who have been treated for at least 10 years. This study compares the outcomes of two different types of root covering procedures: CTG and EMD. Both treatments result in improved patient satisfaction and reduced morbidity."
16354303,"In this paper, the authors describe a double blinded, placebo controlled study of men with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes who receive sil denafil citrated as needed before their sexual activity. The results are that patients respond better to vardenalfil than they do to placebo in terms of improvement in erythrocyte function and satisfaction. They conclude that there is no need for further studies on how well treatment can be performed in different patient groups. This paper also discusses the use of multiple logistic regression to determine whether trials with simple Pooling of Data Over different study periods lead to an accurate estimate of treatment efficacy when compared with other parallel group trials using pregnancy as outcome measure."
18725372,"In this study, we investigate the effect of procollage type I on regressing myocardiasis in patients who have hypertension. We examine the effects of amlopidine treatment on left ventricular masses and free radicals. Acute coronary disease is associated with elevated left atrial mass. Left valvulin hypertrophy is an independent risk factor for heart attack. This study uses a large population of Swedish men aged 50 years old to determine the prevalence of right-ventricular mass and geometry subtypes before age 70. The aim was to identify hemodynamic, metabolic, and psycho social predictors by use of all men born between 1920 and 1924 from the general populace followed up for twenty years. Atrium fibrillation is the most commonly sustained arrhythmic disease. There are few available treatments for it. It is believed that there is some kind of innate inflammation that contributes to its formation. C-reactogen levels are also known to predict the occurrence or severity of post-elective cardiac surgery. These results suggest that statins may be useful in preventing these complications."
25414824,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of weight loss and exercise on patients with type two diabetes. He reports that both diets lead to greater weight Loss in the control groups than those in either group. The results suggest that eating less fat, more carbohydrate, and higher fiber may be beneficial for people with Type 2 disease. Although meat consumption has been associated with risk, evidence suggests that it is not yet clear whether it can be used as a risk factor."
22457397,"In this paper, we examine the effects of a high-flora diet on blood metabolite concentrations in men with and without gout. The results suggest that consumption of sweeten soft drinks may be associated with increased risk of heart disease. We also investigate the relationship between fructosine and other dietary ingredients to determine whether these foods are associated With Gout or Not. This study is designed to assess the efficacy by comparing the effect of an eight-week fasting meal with one of three different types of low-carbohydrate diets."
29951975,"This study aims to compare the resistance of root fillings with guttat-percha, AH-25, and Resilonic on fracture resistance. The aim is to determine whether these two materials can be used as reinforcement for root canals that have been filled with either material. In this study, ninety premolar roots were divided into three control groups: 1) control group received no abturation; 2) experimental group was not included; and 3) negative control population was unfilled. Aims: To compare invito root fracture resistment following root Canalfilling with any form of hydrophilic system -- novel Cpoint system,Resilon/Endo Appiphany sealer,and EndoSquence BC Sealer. Material S and Methods Sixtiful single-rooted tooth were decoronized and prepared to length of 13mm. Forty-five humanmaxillary centralincisor are selected and divided by three experimental groups ""Group 1 -15 rootcans filled With an epoxy resin or urthane dimenthacrylate... Group 2 -16 rootCantals full of another calcium silic-based sealler."" Fifty-fifty teeth were cut into six groups and each group assigned to different groups according to sealers used for Obturnation. These groups consisted of sixty root dentinals treated with one type of cement, eighty bovine crowns removed to size 40, sealed with epoxy rein, or using UDMA polyurethanium dimeth Acrylic 'plus core material'. After testing bond strength, micro-jump shear strength at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40"
30915521,"In this study, we assess the effect of acetic L-clantine on resting, postpranolgy, and iast markers in patients who have a coronary heart disease. We compare the effects of two different forms of anti-inflammatory drugs, sibutrine and L'carnitine, on body weight, gluctance to respond to hypoglyciamic agents, blood pressure, homeostassisis, insulin resistance, leptolin, tumor necroseisfactor-, vasspi, high-sensitivityC-reactiveprotein, Hs C-Reactive Protein. The results show that orlistat Plus L Chlortine is more effective than either treatment alone in improving body mass, fat, glucose, lipoproteincholesterol, Triglyceride, Leptin; and faster improvement in fasting plasmaglucose, Post-prand and Ial Plasma glucose. Probiotics are promising for treating Type 2 Diabetes mellitateus but there is little evidence of their efficacy in terms of improved blood flow."
28356652,"This paper describes a novel early intervention for children with chronic low back pain who are at risk for development delay. It is based on the use of routines-based Early Intervention, or RbeI, to improve performance in patients with stroke. The main objective of this study is to determine whether an eight-week regimen of daily occupational therapy will be more effective than regular home visits for people with acute post-stroke. In this trial, nine patients receive weekly treatment and follow their progress over six months. They also compare the effectiveness of two different types of physical therapy: constraint-induced movement therapy and bi-axial exercise therapy. A total of twelve community-dweling adults receive six hours of occupational training per week plus additional home practices. After three months, the results show significant improvement in both gross motor function and step watch activity scores."
28816346,"In this paper, the authors describe a series of studies that have been performed on blood pressure in patients who have had an acute or chronic disease. The most recent trial is the Suppleémentation - Enfoliates Et Omega-3 Trial, which was published in March of 2000. This study involved 1,500 patients with syphilis and their treatment was divided into four groups: B-Vinmins, 5-methyl-thf, 560 pg.; vitamin B6, 3m., and Vitamin B12; or placebo pills for both treatments. These trials were small but well-regarded. A few reports suggest that IV treatment reduces the odds of dying by 22 % to 5 %) and increases the risk of reinfare ion by 73%. Although all these studies are contradictory, they do show thatIV treatment produces significant reductions in the risks of death and severe adverse effects. Most importantly, however, there has been no single observational study reporting any benefit from IV therapy. Many other studies have reported negative results about IV intervention. For example, one study found that it reduced the rate of myomyocardial Ion / Sterostius by 29%. Another study showed that adding folic acids to prevent stroke could be more effective than either regimen alone among Chinese people with hypertension. However, because of lack of evidence, many physicians still recommend using enalpril as if it were only another form of anti-thrombotic medicine."
23140091,"In this paper, we describe the results of a double blinded rand and ommized study in which we compare the rate of migrating the Profix knee prosthesis after four years with that of cemented or metal-backed prostheses. We report that porous coated implants are more successful than ceted ones at two years. A prospective study is performed to evaluate the effects of different types of cement on the stability of the prostess during total knee replacement. The use of bone cement as an adjuvant to total hip resurfacing has been used for several years; however, it has not been well studied."
29203269,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the efficacy and safety of treatment for localized, locally advanced, or metastatic prostatecancer. He uses a prospective observational cohort of men aged 55-75 years with localised disease to assess the association between radical prostaticide and external beamradiation in terms of overall survival. The primary outcomes were overall mortality and disease-specified mortality. After an initial analysis of biopsy specimens and their blinded assessment of cause of death, results were reported. A recent study showed that cryoablations were not inferior to externally beam radiation therapy in disease progression; however, it was found that these methods could be more cost effective than other approaches."
30488972,"A double- blinded, parallel- group, placebo controlled trial in which eight 14 women were assigned to receive either 150 or 300mg of testosterone patch per day or the same placebo patch. The results showed that the patch increased the frequency of satisfied sexual episodes significantly than the placebo group; however, there was no significant difference in the number of satisfying sexual activities and distress between the groups. In this study, we examine the effects of estrified estrogen alone or combined with a combination of oral androgen on bone mineral density, menopause symptoms, lipopeptide profiles, and biochemistry. We conclude that both treatment regimens prevent bone loss at spine and hip. Estradiol plus rogan therapy improves sexual function and mood in postmenophausal women. This study is based on tidbits from other studies: vaginal pain, vaguinal atrophy, efficacy for treating patients with low levels of testosterone, effect on brain function in patients who have had urogeniliac atrocities, use of topical propionate cream as lubricating cream, etc."
32197092,"In this study, the effects of cannabinol on brain function are compared in healthy subjects. After three days, patients receive either 10mg of delta9tetrahidrocannabidiol or a single dose of placebo. The results suggest that cannics can induce changes in human brain functions and that they may be especially beneficial in patients with severe mental illness. This paper also reports on the effect of Cb1R-agonists on psychosis. It is reported that these agents have been used as an antipsychotic agent in several studies. However, it has not been shown to work well in humans."
26915661,"This study focuses on the interrater agreement of each item of the Cosmin-Standard Questionnaire as an outcome measure for health-reported outcome measures. Raters assess the methodological quality of 3 articles using the checklist. The results indicate that the items agree well and that there is a significant increase in the reliability of these items over time. Hearing aids are used as assessment instruments, but question naire technology has been developed for the paper and pencil form. A comparison is made between the use of self report questions with those offered by semi-structured interviews. In this study, we examine whether the answer to the ""Internet-based question"" satisfies the same psychometric properties as the response from two different types of patients: teachers in Taiwan and students in other countries."
19567343,"In this study, Lactobacilus acidophilous suppostories are shown to be safe and effective in treating recurrent lower urinary-tract infection. Forty two women seriously affected with acute lower Urinary tract infection were initially given an acid gel or placebogel to treat the condition. After they were treated for 7 days, they entered into double blind trials. They were then treated prophyically 3 days per month with either Lactate Gel or another placebo gel. Women treated by lactate gel improved their vaginal health but did not cure BV. A doubleblind trial was performed whereby patients were divided into two groups: one group received no treatment and the other group had a higher rate of cure. The results showed that both regimens achieved similar efficacy against Gardnerella, clue cells, and achiote. This study suggests that LacTobacillus salve can be used as an antimicrobial agent against vulvostinitis. It is concluded that it is possible to prevent occurrence of UTI after antibiotic treatment. Probiotic preparations have been proven successful in preventing minor gyniasis; however, there is little evidence for their effectiveness in controlling urogeninal infections."
26770296,"In this study, we examine the histological and rudimentary results of direct pulp capping in human teeth. We compare the efficacy of CaOH or MTA in preventing tooth defects from developing. Forty-seven patients were followed for two years to determine whether root canal therapy was necessary."
23997134,"In this paper, we describe a prospective double blinded trial of patients who undergo fixed bearing knee arthrosis. The results are similar to those obtained with the fixed-beating prosthesis in terms of pain scores and satisfaction. We compare the short-lived results of two different types of knee replacements: 1) an implant bearing or 2) cruciate bearing. This study is designed to determine whether the difference in patient satisfaction is due to differences in the amount of time that they spend on active flexion. Both groups have better pain score and subjective preference than either group does. A second study compares the results after total knee surgery with both bearing designs. It was found that the bearing design had greater motion and improved function but did not improve long-term recovery. Another study examines changes in range of motion between the wear-rate of the prothesis and the degree of change in patellar position. These changes were reported in several studies. For example, one study examined the effect of self-Alignment on Patellaar Tracking; another study looked at bone densiputation by using femorometry. Finally, these studies investigated the effects of changing the shape of their bearings for knee arthropy."
30003896,"This study focuses on the effects of eating raisins on blood pressure, lipoproteins, glucose, and inflammation. Thirty four men and post-menopatrasal women were assigned to consume one cup of raisins/d or increase steps walked in either direction. The subjects complete a two-wk runin period, followed by another six-week intervention. In this study, thirty-four healthy adults were matched with weight and gender; they were surreprititiously assigned for either selfpaced or moderate intensity exercise. Aim: To examine the effect of high-intension interval training on Nitric oxide availability and inflammatory expression in obese humans without type 2 diabetic mellitateus. Methods Forty-nine young premonopeals were divided into three groups: 1) an ex-group that was required to selfmonitor daily step count; 2) an experimental group who were asked to create specific walking plans; and finally 3) an unstructured group that consisted of 30 minutes per day of walking at prescribed heartbeat intensity. Results were satisfied with physical function and physical appearance. These results suggest that walking with pole's may be useful for improving body image among overweight individuals with Type 2 diabetes."
31482198,"The aim of this study is to determine whether improvements in physical activity, a high quality diet, and drinking moderately are associated with reductions in risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In addition, it is shown that patients with newly diagnosed Type 2 have reduced their risk for developing major chronic disease such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, or cancer. This study also examines the role of lifestyle factors in predicting the long-lived effects of certain lifestyle changes on the development of these conditions."
25848343,"A rand omization trial in breast cancer is performed to compare the safety of pre-operative and post-surrogate treatment. The results indicate that there are no significant differences between the two treatments for disease free survival and overall survival. In this study, we examine the association between histology grade, tumor size, estrogen andprogesterone signaling, lymph nodes status, hertogene receptors, phosphorus expression, and tubulinIII. We conclude that these markers are associated both with diseasefree survival as well as with Overall Survival. This study uses an umbrella approach to decision making in early breastcancer. It involves patients receiving either four or eight regimens of docotaxel, epirubicn, methottrexate, fluorreaacil; they also assess their tolerability, quality of life, risk of toxicity, severity of illness, etc. These studies were published in several papers. One of the most important trials was the National Epirublicitin Adjuvant Study, which showed that it improved disease freedom after five years when compared to conventionally scheduled chemotherapy. Another trial was designed to determine whether adding taxaines to anthracine-based therapy would improve survival in women with operably node positive breastcy. Women who had nodal lesions received either FEC 100 or CMF 200 at three weeks' intervals followed by one week of capecitebine. They found that each regimen produced a reduction in p53 gene expression but did not show any difference in long term outcome."
21383023,"This study focuses on the effects of resistance training on older adults. In this paper, we examine the effect of progressive resistance-straining on muscle power and performance in older adult women. The results are mixed: strength gains more rapidly than power with age, but there is no clear relationship between strength and power. Age-related reductions in muscles power may be early indication of balance deficiencies and fall risk; even in unfrail adults"
29955550,"The present study focuses on the safety of varenicline as an effective treatment for patients with concurrent alcohol and tobacco dependence. It is a double blinded, placebo-control trial in which subjects were motivated to quit smoking without psychism. In this study, we examine the relationship among smoking history, motivation to quitting, and smoking abstinence outcomes in people who are suspected of having schizofienic disease. We compare the results of two group psychological therapy programs for smoking reduction in persons with schizophrenia or other mental illnesses. Forty-fifteen subjects met DSM-III criteria for schizophrenia; they were randomed to bupropin SR 300mg/day or placebo. Outcomers included treatment retention, smoking banstinence rate, expired breath Carbon monoxide levels, sexual symptoms, medication side effects. This study was designed to investigate the efficaciousness of adding sustained release buproppion to cognitive behavior therapy in patients suffering from schizophrenia. After eighteen subjects had completed the trial, Bupropion treated was associated with significant reductionin smoking rates as measured by Self-Report Verified by expired Breath Carbon MonoxidE levels. Furthermore, it was found that there was some indication that smoke may be self-medicated. Although many studies have examined the effectiveness of burenicline in treating patients With schizophrenia, none have investigated the effect of changing the dosage of suicidally added buPropion into long-term hospitalsized schiziphil patients."
20097493,"In this paper, the authors describe a doubleblind, placebo controlled study on preterm babies. The primary outcome is weight gain. Preterms are susceptible to excessive bacterial coloniation of the gut and have adverse health effects. To investigate whether or not Lactobacilus Gg can colonize the immure bowel in prematurely bred infants, we compare the numbers of colonies formed by lactobacteria with those obtained from controls. We conclude that probiotic administration may reduce the over growth of enterococtic pathogens; however, there is little evidence for the safety of adding pre-biotics to infant formulae."
25148386,"The Cord Ia trial compares the effects of valsaran or lansartan on atrium fibrillation, recurrance, and procollagen Type I carboxyterminal peptide. In this particular study, we evaluate the effect of two different antihypertinesive agents on blood pressure in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Both are shown to be superior to one another in terms of quality of life after five years. A double blind, parallel-gazed clinical trial is planned to determine whether an antihysteria intervention at the ""proximal"" or distal levels of the RENIN-ANGOTENSIN system can have different effects upon a wide range of innovative risk Biomarkers. We plan to conduct rand and ommized,double blind trials to assess whether either treatment is more efficacious than the other drugs used in each class. Our primary objective is to investigate the persistency on therapy and how extent of Blood pressure control in 346 hypertensives patients were assigned to receive either ramipriml or los artan. After comparing blood flow before and after lengthy treatment with telmistan, lastan was found to improve renal function in subjects with hypertension. This study also compared the results of three different treatments for patients suffering from chronic kidney disease: 1) amlopidine 10 mg plus HCTZ12.5 combination; 2) angiotensol-converting enzyme blocker vs. antigensin-type 1 receptor blockinger; and finally 3) combined treatment of Angiotesin II/ARB blockers as monotherapy."
32145741,"In this study, we examine the effects of a testosterone replacement regimen on bone mineral density, body composition, and physical function in older patients. Forty two men with low total test levels were assigned to receive either transdermal or placebo patches daily for 12 months. The objective is to determine whether the effect of ""torture"" can be used to improve bone mass and reduce fracture risks in elderly men. Thirtey men aged 55-82 years were divided into three groups: 1) TTT; 2) Anastrozole; and 3) placebo pills daily. All subjects received one of three treatments for 36 months each. Aged 70-80 years included those with high bloodtesterone levels but no significant changes in BMD. This was followed by an assessment of the affects of testosterone treatment upon glucose homeostosis, obesity, sexual function among middle-aged males with type 2, diabetes, mild androgen deficiention. Twenty-five men received testosterone undecamoate at weekly intervalses or pill-doses. A subset of 30 intermediate frail old men had low testosterone levels and were eligible for trial therapy. After six months of treatment, they underwent an ultrasound examination of their muscle architecture. Fatigue, anorexia, depression,and mortality were associated with lower testosterone level in men without hypothamic / pituitsary disease. Men with advanced cancer had bioavailable testosterone below the reference limit of young adults. Bioavailability was not an indication for testing therapy in these men because there are many men over age 65 who have low normal testosterone values. They were also given 500 mg phosphorus and 1,000 IU Vitamin D. These studies showed that fatigue improved quality of life as well as improvement in performance. As men age, their serum tests decrease. Body composition and muscles function were increased. Dysfunct muscles contribute to exercise intolerability in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."" Testosterto replacement therapy has been shown safe and efficacious in healthy older people. However, it is unknown whether its effects on heart health and stroke are altered by underlying chest artery disease"
32249071,"This study uses a five-year history of patients with Cystic Fabrisis to develop if the changes in the fat acid profile can be maintained during long-term studies. The results of this study are reported in several articles. In particular, the authors describe how infants with severe fatty acid deficiencies may respond to short term antioxidant supplementation. A cross-over study is performed to assess whether the effect of short-lived or long periods of zinc and other nutrients on lung function is possible. Children with cystically fibrosists may have deficiencies of some of these important nutrients; however, there is no international study that has examined the importance of algal oil as an anti-inflammatory agent. Another study investigates efficacy of omega-3 Polyunsulated Fatty Acids in treating diseased patients. It was found that the ratio of the total phospholipid content of fish oil to that of olive oil did not change significantly after one year of treatment."
17088502,"This study aims to determine the time course and type of early behavior changes that precede recovering in treatment-responsed patients. Antidepressant agents such as sex or norephrine are effective in treating depressed patients, but there is little evidence for their efficacy in this population. The present trial uses a parallel group, placebo-control, doubleblind design to examine the effects of repeated anticontradictive drugs on perception and recall in healthy volunteers. Forty two female and male volunteers were assigned to seven days of double blindd intervention with either escorts of citaloperam 20mg/day or sertraline 8m daily. On the last day, facial expression recognize, emotion potentiated beginle response, and memoryfor affect-laden Words were assessed. Both acilopram and serotonine produced significantly greater improvements than placebo on all of these outcome measures. Paroxeten appeared to have an possibly greater and later beneficial effect on anxious symptoms associated with major depression when compared against imipramine; both active treatments were effective at treating patients with serious depression. In addition, paroxetine showed superiority to placebo in terms of reduction in Hamilton Rating Score for Major Depressive disorder. Fluonoxetained release was approved for the use of minor depressive disorders in the dosagerange of 25 to 60 mg daily; however, lower doses had not been investigated yet in those who met DPMIII's severity requirements. Paroxentine was recommended as an investigational drug because it appears to act through selectively inhibiting neuronal Serotonein uptake."
31464396,"In this study, we examine the association between a long-term consumption of individual trans fatty acids and risk of heart disease. We compare two large studies in which subjects were free of chronic diseases at their baseline. The first study showed that trans fats increased total cholesterol but reduced low-dental lipoprotein while the second showed similar effects on lipostogenemic markers. Young adults examined the effect of coconut oil on blood lipid profiles as well as those of palm oil. This study was followed by another study to investigate the affects of different types of fat on serum phospholipids. It was found that palm oils had an anti-cholestering effect on both total and LDLcholesterol. A further study is performed to assess the effects of certain diets on various risk factors for coronary heart attack."
24917590,"In this study, we examine the association between African-Americans and Caucasians with knee ostearthritis. We find that physical activity is associated with improved health status in older adults who are at risk for knee injury. This study also uses a multiple-compartment intervention to determine whether exercise and behavior change will improve functional performance over time."
22776399,"This study focuses on the use of an activity monitor to predict physical activity intensity in older adults. The results suggest that age does not affect the accuracy of this device, but that it is more accurate than direct calorimetric measurements. A second study uses a tri-axial accelerometer to calculate energy expenditure for older patients with chronic heart disease. In this paper, we examine the ability of two motion-sensing boards to track changes in walking speed and determine the relationship between steps and body movements. We compare the performance of three motion sensing devices: the Tritrac-r3D, the Actical, and the indirect carolimeter K4b2, as well as those of other devices used for measuring exercise intensity."
15774495,"Digoxin, a diuretic agent, is not effective in treating heart failure. It is unclear whether the drug can be used to improve blood flow during exercise. A double blinded crossover study was designed to examine the effect of adding L-Arginine to patients with mild or moderate heart failing. The results showed that it improved their quality of life as well as their ability to walk. Two large multicentred trials were conducted on the effects of additionst andard therapy with amalodipine; they found no difference in changes in exercise tolerance upon 'Naughton protocol' compared with either placebo. In these studies, digoxil had favorable effects on health-regarding qualityof life, but only celiprolil did. These studies examined the long- term efficacy for metoprololil versus captoprill in patients who have chronic heart fail. Both drugs reduced the ventricular response and improved the symptoms of disease. They also investigated the use of angioensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in congesive heart failed patients. This study evaluated the benefits of single- site left ventricle pacing when combined with biventricular  Pacing. Although this treatment has some drawbacks, it does improve the function of elderly patients suffering from congestive heartf failure because of its high risk of death. Congestive Heart Failure: An increase in bleeding hemoglobin may improve exercise performance by improving oxygen delivery. Hemodynamic Changes during daily living and maximum exerciseDuring chronic Left Ventriular Dysfunction: Biventricular Pre-excitation might improve haemolodynamity and well- being by reducing arrhythmian constriction. Metoproprolol increases functional capacity in people with severe heart fiasco."
15106221,"In this chapter, the authors present a detailed description of the methods used to develop r and Omised controlled trials in order to assess the efficability of idine-containing treatments. The first study was carried out by comparing two groups of schoolchildren who were severely deficient with an equal number of control groups. This group consisted of children from seven to 11 years old living in an ""iodin-deficient region of Benin."" After 10 mo of treatment, goiter had reduced significantly in both groups; however, there were no significant differences in performance on the Bender test or somatic growth in all children. A further study is performed in Zimbabwe to determine whether biscuits fortified either with iron, ions, or iron would affect the mental health of primary school students. It was found that these diets did not lead to improvement in the quality of their pupils' education. However, it was concluded that they could be useful as preventive measures against ill health. Another study has been conducted in Congo to evaluate the effectiveness of low dose IV uodinated oil on reduction of Goitre in three villages. These studies have shown that even small doses are sufficient to reduce the severity of disease."
30368675,"In this study, Wuthering Heights et al concludes that there is a high risk of fall among elderly people in the coldest climates and that home help services are associated with these risks. They also report that older women living in cold states have higher falls than younger women who live in warmer weather. The aim then is to investigate the frequency of falls among adults aged 65-89 years. A population-based cohort was conducted on people aged 60-88 years after 1990 to 1997. There were 1092 cases of hip fracture per 100000 person years; the relative risk was 1.21 for men and 1.84 for women. Type of environment hazard was diverse, but it was unlikely that measures to prevent falls would reduce the risk. This study is the first prospective study carried out by 1517 elderly Chinese patients. Baseline information on Demographic,  Comorbid diseases, drugs, activities of daily living, ADL / BarthelIndex and Lawthon's instrumental activitiesof Daily Living. Geriatric depression scale: Gds 15, Cognition by the abbreviated mental test."" Fear of falling,"" self-perception of mobility problem "" & lower limb strength ) were performed. Every subject followed up for one year. All subjects were community dwellers, mentally intact, previous ambulatory elders who sustained femur neck or intertorochanteric breaks. Most fracture occurs at home, particularly in those who were older, less healthy, and poorier walkerers. More than 70 % of all fractures resulted from an accident while walking or stumbling. Falling occurred in Hokkaidedo, Japan, which experienced ice storms. Although the conditions surrounding falls within the elderly population have been described before, there are no reports of such incidents in northern regions of Japanese society. As if to further confirm the severity of the situation, we compared the blood pressure of two groups of elderly subjects over three months. Both groups had different levels of temperature change. At 6 degrees C, both groups fell more rapidly during the winter."
26841160,"This is a prospective, cross-examination study of six women with all types of endometry who undergo laparoscopic surgical treatment. The patients receive either letrozol or norethroisterone Acetate for 6 months and their pain scores are measured by the visual anallogue scale. In this study, we examine the efficaciousness of letrazole in relieving pain caused by endogenosis. We also assess the tolerable effects of both letrocoles and noretethister one A1c in treating pain related to the appearance of rectostomy lesions. After six months, five women have undergone surgery and histology examination confirms that there is ""activeendometriotic lesion"" in the patient's bowel."
31408248,"In this study, we examine a cross sectional and prospectiove neuropsychlogical study of 181, aged 16-20 years. We compare performance indiceses from one ofthe most widely used measure of learning and memorized tests between cannabis-using and alcohol-useing subjects. They perform significantly worse than those who are not using the drug. The results suggest that early-initiation but late-onset use may be associated with higher risk of developing major depressed disorder later in life. This effect is present in high frequency; an odds ratio of 1.29 to 70.79 was found. A recent report suggests that fewer young adults believe that regular use is harmful for health. However, there is little evidence regarding the acuteness of these effects among youths. Although many studies have examined the association between long-term use and mental disorders, few have investigated the role of cue-responsive brain activity in the development of such disorders."
27496935,"This study consists of three groups: an aquatic group, a light-hearted group and 'control group'. The first group is assigned to the control group; the second group will be assigned as either water-based or exercise-only. In this paper, we examine the effect of an aqua-aerobics training program on body mass and function in older women. We observe that the AAG group has improved both bone mineral content and functional autonomy while the other group does not participate in any regular exercise. Furthermore, there are no significant differences in the results between the two groups."
26888713,"In this paper, we examine the relationship between the FTO-rs99329609 and body weight changes in European children. We compared the results of two years' follow-up surveys with those from other European countries. The study concludes that the common single-ucleotoide Polymorphism is associated with an increase in risk of obesity. However, there is little knowledge of whether the fat mass or obesity-related gene can be a predictor of long-term health changes. A group of 811 overweight people were assigned to one diet; the percentages of food derived fromfat, protein, and carbogenel were 20 %, 15 %) and 55  percent. After 2 years, both diets had significant effects on body composition and fat content. Both genotypes showed greater changes than either type of diet except for their effect on blood pressure. These studies are important because they provide new information about the molecular basis of disease development. For example, some studies have suggested that certain polymorphic variants may lead to increased risk due to elevated levels of insulin resistance. Furthermore, these studies suggest that many of the most commonly associated genetic traits may also predict future changes within individuals who lose more than three p.m. in their weight. This study uses established alleles as predictators of future weight loss among patients with Type 2 diabetes."
21710185,"In this study, we examine the efficaciousness of a combination of milk-based and soy-policyd infant formulas in treating infantile colicky disease. We conclude that these infants are more likely to recover from their colic when they receive either an appropriate amount of food or one of the following treatment: 1) massage; 2) sucrose solution; 3) herbal tea; or 4) hydrolysed cream. The results of this trial suggest that feeding infantically with whey-containing formula may be more effective than feeding them with cow's milk alone. This paper also reports that mothers who were breast-fed during the first three months of pregnancy reported that their babies had moderate or serious problems of feeding nor crying. A double blind crossover study was conducted to determine whether infantil colicit is associated with Malabsorption of carbohydrate present in fruitjuices. Infants fed both types of diets showed significant improvement in their symptoms after two weeks of follow-up."
15924510,"The aim of the study is to compare percutaneous translucal angiology with supervised exercises for patients with an arterial oclusive disease. In this paper, we describe the results of a single blinded study in which all patients were assigned one of three treatment groups: 1) an intense treatment group; 2) conventional treatment only; and 3) physical training only. After two months, there was no significant improvement in functional recovery in the intervention group. Acute strokes are particularly difficult to treat because they involve long periods of daily living activities. However, as the disease progresses, it becomes evident that some patients do not respond well to regular physical exercise. For example, patients who have moderately advanced hip or knee pain show little improvement after six months of physical therapy."
30647466,"Melatonin appears to have a beneficial effect on the biological clock in patients with chronic, uncontrolled hypertension. In this paper, we investigate whether repeated nighttime doses of morphine can reduce blood pressure in people with essential hypertension. We conclude that melate can be used as an anti-hypertinergic agent and that it may also improve the function of the body's clock. This study is aimed at evaluating the effects of two different forms of sleep medicine: 1) opium pills and 2) alcohol. The aim of these studies is to assess the relationship between the time-remaining changes in blood flow and the activity of autonomic nervous system in type 2 diabetes mellitated patients. These patients are divided into three groups: acutely induced by single or repeated daily for 4 weeks; repeated daily from 3 weeks to 6 months; and placebo-controlled. A total of 46 Type 2 patients were studied. They were divided according to their severity of disease. After 24 hours of observation, they were assigned to either control release or placebo. Each group was given one hour before bedtime. All patients underwent continuous bloodpressure monitoring during the day and after midnight. Both groups received nocturnally irritated pulses. At the conclusion of each period, both groups had periods of restorative sleep. There was no significant change in heart rate or BP over the course of four weeks. Another study was performed to determine whether the evening consumption of pineal hormone could interfere with the use of antihypersive therapy in hypotensives. It was found that the administration of 5mg per day increased blood tension and heart rates in men with coronary diseases. However, there was little difference in the mean values of arterial pulsation and carotidic reactivity. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that even though molatone may blunt the activities of cardiovascular system, it might have some physiopathological and clinical implications."

After receiving individual instruction and training, participants were assigned to one of three different groups: aerobic exercise, resistance exercise or usual carecontrol. All subjects completed the revised piper fatigue scale, PFS, and the six minute walk test at baseline and 12 weeks post-execrcise program. The results from the ETUGG test were comparisond to those from another test on three group of subjects: nonimpatient young, unimpaired elderly,and elderly subjects atrisk of falling. Walking speed is the only measure found to be significant differences between the two controls for all components"
30516592,"In this study, we systematically examine the effcacy of patient choice for treatment of acute and uncomplicate acute appendicetis. We conclude that patients with mild to severe acuteappendiciitis may be better treated with short-term therapy than with surgery. This is an important issue because many studies have shown that antibiotics are safe and effective in treating acutely complicated disease. However, there is still debate about whether or not it is appropriate for children to receive long-lasting treatment. For example, one recent study showed that early appeptectomy was associated with increased risk of colorecian scarring. Another study reported that delayed appendication was more likely to result in longer follow-up periods after apppendicectomy. The results of this trial were similar to those of other trials; however, they did not reveal any significant differences in the severity of symptoms or severity at the time of the trial."
26103030,"In this study, we compare the effects that cannanbinols have on patients suffering multiple sclerical pain. The results of the first two trials are described in detail. A double blind placebo-controlled crossover trial is performed to determine whether cancanabinoids improve central pain in multiple Sclerosis. This was an important aspect of our previous work. We found that THC and CBD were more effective than placebo in improving pain intensity for patients with multiple diseases. Furthermore, they showed significant reductions in mean pain scores from baseline to end of treatment. Cannaninoid extracts were also shown to be better at relieving pain when compared to other antiemetic agents. Another study was conducted to assess the safety and effectiveness of cannabis-based medicines in treating chronic pain due to brachialplexus root disease. It was concluded that these drugs could be used as analgesically or even as parenteral therapy."

29635250,"In this study, we examine the effects of genetic testing on physical activity in a group of European adults. We assess whether it is possible to use genetic information to predict changes in body composition and health behavior after six-month intervention. The results suggest that using genotype-based information can lead to larger changes than conventional approaches. This study also uses an extended follow-up period to evaluate the impact of genomic risk assessment on smoking behavior. A multicomponent approach was used to determine whether adding genetic test information could increase risk perceptions about lung disease and encourage quit attempts."
26053004,"In this study, we examine the effects of an integrated care approach on patients with type two diabetes. We assess adherence to medication and blood pressure at three months' intervals. The results show that there is no significant difference in patient performance, quality of life, or subjective outcomes between African American men who receive follow-up over a six-month period and those who do not. Aim To compare short message service as compared to regular care among patients without Type 2 diabetes; Methods This trial was based on pre-and post-test designs. Thirty African Americans were assigned to either group to receive either Group or individual diabetes self- management education program. Prior to the treatment, 30 AfricanAmerican men were given two groups: one group received telephone follow up for 6 months while the other group had been assigned usual care. Results showed no differences in any measure of the selected medical, patient performances,quality oflife, and subjective outcome. An attempt was made to compare the efficaciousness of telephoning approaches to preserve appropriate bloodglucose levels and might improve  adherence to diabetes control prescriptions in diabetic subjects. Two studies were conducted regarding the use of cell phone technology to support objectively lyassessed absorption of oral glucose lower medication. These studies examined the effectiveness of ""an empowerment-based"" diabetes Self-Management Support"" intervention on health status, emergency departmentutilization, diet habits, physical activity, weight loss, etc. Furthermore, these studies found that physicians could be more effective when they used decision aids such as Diabetes Medication choice.

We aim to analyze the age-specified associations of bloodpressure with 12 acute or chronic cardiovascular disease, and estimate the lifetime risks up to 95years of age and heart failure-free life years lost adjusted for others risk factors atindex ages 30, 6, and 80 years. The results of this trial are described in detail. It is reported that hypertensives who have an untreated high body-stuffelic blood level should be treated with either an angiotesin-conversion-enzym inhibitor or an antihypersive drug class. This treatment reduces the risk of fatal or non fatal stroke in patients with Type 2 diabetes. A recent report suggests that use of calcium antagonists for hypertension might increase the chance of developing dangerous complications. Although there is little evidence against these agents, it is suggested that they may lead to increased severity of kidney disease."
15078851,"In this paper, Anderson systematically reviews the literature on breast cancer. The most important finding is that there is no significant survival difference between patients receiving either pre- or Post-masticide radical mastectomy with or without adjuvant regimens. He concludes that only the presence of ""> or = four negative nodes"" are associated with improved survival. However, in addition to these two groups, it is found that those with more than four positive node have a higher risk of disease relapse. Furthermore, for patients with greater than five nods, an increase in their overall survival is likely due to the increased frequency of occurrence of distant metasticities. This study furthermore examines the role of post-marchectomy and concurrent therapy in localized breastcancer. It was previously reported that both types of treatment had been shown to be effective but that they did not show any significant differences in time to repeat surgery. Although some studies have suggested that left-sidedradiation and doxomycin may lead to increased risk from cardiac toxicity, others have noted that such treatments do not seem to cause as much morbidity as they do."
21154392,"A rand-blind, rater blinded study compares low-dose paroxene to a st or ard of care parodytine for thetreatment of panic attacks. The objective was to assess efficacy as well as tolerability in patients with anxiety disorder who have not yet received adequate treatment. In this paper, the authors describe an eight-week trial of quetigapine plus placebo for patients suffering from generalized anxious disorder. All active agents produce significant improvements on the Hamilton Rating Score for Anxiness and Clinical Global Impressment scales. This is the first time that such sensitivity to changes has been reported in these studies. Depression and anxiety often have substantial overlapping symptoms complexes; not only are they treated with antidepressers but also with serotonine relapse inhibitors which do not work. These conditions are particularly difficult to treat after initial opiprazole therapy. For example, many patients fail to respond adequately to either drug because they remain symptomatically despite their initial regimen. More research needs to be done to determine whether ""next-step"" treatments can improve outcome. Thirty subjects with pity for anxiety disorders receive open-l label augmentation with rapid-acting morphine for 8 weeks. After 6 weeks, however, there is no significant change in anxiety symptoms among the patients. Next step approaches include double blind augmenters with alpha-agonists or other non-alphargic agents. Forty patients continue to experience anxiety problems Despite current anxisolytic treatment at least four weeks / duration. As evidence suggests that next steps may be necessary for improving response, we present one of those first-line intervention trials for people with generalised anxiety disease. Twenty-four patients were  R and Omized to Quetia pine or placebo. At week 8, all active agent produced significant improvement on Ham-A's total score.

17414146,"In this paper, the authors describe a doubleblind, placebo- controlled trial of iron and Vitamin A on anemia, weight, and height in infants from low social economic background. The results indicate that daily iron is not sufficient to prevent or reduce anemic disease. Iron deficient anions are common among poor socioeconomic status. Children with severe upper respiratory tract infection are assigned to either treatment group; children without infection receive the control group. This study investigates whether iron can improve blood Fe levels as well as physical growth in schoolchildren who have both goitor and iron depleteiency anities. Hematology, anthropometer, morbidness, laboratory assessment, diet, absorption were measured before and after each treatment period. After two months, these subjects improved their health by improving their hemoglobin, ferritine, transferrein saturation, haemolin concentration, free rythrocyteprotoporphylin value, serum ferritsin values, basal glutathion peroxidases activity, etc. These studies suggest that iron fortified foods may be effective at preventing iron deficiencies but that knowledge of their possible interactions when they are combined is insufficient."

The results of this study indicate that workers from Norway report less shoulder pain after an intervention than those from the United States and the Norwegians. In contrast, the Polish group reports more neck pain than either the U. S. or the American groups. This study concludes that there is a need for improved ergonomics during work with the use of computers. It also suggests that patients may be better able to tolerate longer periods of time in front of re-emergency display terminals because of the greater range of motion involved."
30031025,"In this study, we investigate the effects of repeated anti-depressant treatments on perception and recall in healthy volunteers. Forty- two male and female patients were assigned to 7 day of double blindd intervention with either a sarcastically reuptoprecipitating serotonephrine or noradrenalin ruptake inhibitor; on the final day, emotional-potentialed startle response was measured. The results of these studies suggest that an antidepressedant may be more effective in treating depressed patients than other agents. Acute treatment increases positive affectative processing in healthier volunteers, but it has not yet been studied in clinical populations. This study uses functional magnetic resonance image to map brain regions involved in recognition of fearful faces. It is concluded that acute treatment of an overly strong anxiety-provoking drug such as escorts improves mental health in depression-prone patients."

The results suggest that adjustment for prognosestic covariate may lead to large increase in power in practice. Preoperative administration of gabaparin might reduce acute postoperative or chronic pain. This study compares the effectiveness of preoperative catechism and grade-d activity for patients with elevated pain-related fear. A double blinded trial is performed to investigate whether preopératin can decrease acute and long term postopatra pain after robot-aided endoscopic thoracolectomy. It was concluded that ropivivacaine infiltrated the scalp reduced acute as well as persistent postoperation pain following intracranial tumour resection. Two separate brews of observational studies have been conducted: one in US and two in French and Germany. Fibromyalsia is a disease caused by widespread, persistent pain; there is little evidence for its efficacy in routine practice across the U.S., France, and German countries. There are no reliable treatments for Fibrimyalgy, which has driven an increasing emphasis on preventive treatment. Post mastectomy pain syndrome develops after breast surgery like many other types of nocturnal pain but that resolve before it can be diagnosed. An educational program called ""The Back Book"" has been designed to provide evidence-based information about back pain while improving patient's beliefs about their pain condition.

27820060,"The aim of this study is to determine whether brief physician advice can be used to reduce the frequency and intensity of alcoholism in older adults. This paper focuses on two different groups of patients: those who have no previous treatment for drinking and those that receive routine medical care. One group receives counsel about their drinking, while the other receive only routine medicine. Both groups report reductions in alcohol consumption at six months' time but both groups improve their outcomes when they are asked to identify problems. It is concludeed that systematic testing for alcohol-use and related problems must become part of medical assessment and that advice should be effective if giving before irreversibly physical or psychological problems have developed. In this paper, we describe a patient-centered intervention designed to help older adult drinkers manage their disease. Acutely ill patients with severe heart disease are treated with an intense lifestyle change over five years. They show significant improvements in several lifestyle-related behaviors. These include weight reduction, improved exercise capacity, and reduced pain during an exercises test. Furthermore, these patients were better able to control their risk factors than controls. Although smoking cessations are important goals for men with coronary diseases, similar results for women are missing. For example, there has been little success in using dietitian or nurses as coachs for stroke patients. However, many physicians do not prescribe drugs because they feel it is cost-effective to do so. Physicians often use stepped-care approaches to treat patients without prescribing drugs. Therefore, stepspread refers to ""the practice of inititing treatment with low intensities"" and then revealing failures by successively more vigorous treatments. Thus, Stepped Care referses to the practice whereby patients are instructed to achieve their target values for their particular risk factor."
25979719,"In this third of four articles, the authors discuss the use of relative risk and absolute risk reduction in predicting events in patients. They describe two methods for calculating these measures: relative risks reduction and odds ratio. One method uses an electrode placed on the motor cortex to induce transcranial magnetostimulation; the other uses a real electrode that can be used to stimulate the cortical regions of the body. The results of this study indicate that propofole is superior to placebo in relieving central pain. This paper also discusses the importance of using multiple measures of pain intensity as predictors of efficacy in treating patients with acute or chronic pain who are not yet at risk for heart attack."

Sixteen males were divided into four groups: 1) control group; 2) GH-Adm; 3) Plc; and 4) placebo. The results showed no significant differences in any of these measured anthropometry, hormonal, or metabolic characteristics. A double blind crossover study was performed to determine the effects of fourteen days of grow-horrid treatment on exercise performance, body composition, and other measures of health. We examined the changes in blood concentrations after 14 days with growth hormone as an adjudicator for free IGF-iI and Igf-II levels. This study also investigated whether low-dose growth Horrified affects bone remodeling in young healthy men. Eight healthy subjects were given either placebo or a high dose of human growth Hg. After 28 days, all patients were assigned to receive one of three different treatment regimens. Each regimen consisted of six weeks of daily subcutaneous injections or tablet/gel combination. Biochemistry markers of bone regeneration were studied in twenty normal male subjects aged 21 to 30 years. They received either recombineant human Gh or placebo at each treatment. Both studies revealed that there was no difference in bone mineral content between the two treatments.

21412147,"In this paper, we describe the efficaciousness of single-bolus cefaxone as an antimicrobial agent for patients undergoing open heart surgery. We compare short-acting prophylaxes to long-term regimens of antibiotics and conclude that it is more cost effective to use only one dose than to administer several times a day. Acute-brain infarctions are particularly common after major open-heart surgery; however, recent studies have shown inappropriate timing, selection, and excess length of administration of these agents. The most important cause of infection in acute-care patients is surgical site infections."

A new injectable form of haloperoid is used as an initial treatment for acutely disturbed and psychotic patients. It has been reported that it can be more efficacious than other antipsychotic drugs because of its rapid action on behavior- motor activity. However, there are reports of side effects from both forms of medicine. This study uses syphilis as guinea worm disease control. After two weeks, all patients receive one or two daily doses of soliloquy. They show no difference in response between the two groups but no differences in quality of life."

It is reported that biphorous patients are more likely to respond to psychological intervention than usual care. A novel web-based treatment for bicyclic disorder has been developed."
30231505,"In this paper, we report that a probiotic strain called Lactobacilus GG has been shown to reduce the risk of developing syphilis in children with at-risk pregnancies during the first two years of life. This is due to the fact that infants who are given the strain have fewer cases of disease than those who receive placebo. We also show that early consumption of the lethal strain prevents eczyma in susceptible children during their first 2 years and that it does not increase the severity or frequency of these outbreaks. Furthermore, there is no difference in the incidence of asthma or ear itch between pregnant and nursing mothers. The use of breast-fed infant milk as an anti-adolescent's source of nutrition for protection against rheumatia remains elusive."

Cleaners aged 18-65 years were assigned to either an aerobic exercise program or a resistance training group. The results showed significant reduction in blood pressure, body fat, and pain. A pilot study was conducted in Denmark to assess the efficacy of two different types of physical exercise on health outcomes. Ninety five employees were clustered and ommized into control groups; no particular group was selected. In this study, all nineteen cleaners were divided into three groups: 1) Control group; 2) Novice group only; and 3 x 2 weeks experienced group after completing their worksite exercises. Body composition, physical ability, need for recover, productivity,and rating of exertions were assessed. All measures were calculated by mixed model. Results dropped out at 4 and 6 months. Brain Snack: Musculoskeletal fitness is not yet well understood. There are few studies on how it is explained by obesity. For example, one study found that muscular strength is more important than bone mineral content in African American women. Another study examined the effect of intelligent physical education training on muscleoson health. It was concluded that workers who received high intensity exercise had improved their muscle strength and performance. Furthermore, there was no difference in perceived discomfort between the trained group and the unsupervised group when compared to those who did not receive any training."
29372708,"In this paper, the authors describe a new type of sealant that uses fluoride to prevent tooth caries. It is described as an ""unfilled resin"" with no fillings and can be used in both sealed and unfilled mouths. The results of the study indicate that it does not show any significant differences in retainment or porosity after 12 months. This study compares two different types of restorative materials: Admira Flo vs Gr and Io Flow for children who have newly erumped permanent morals; and Fissuring F - io flow for patients who do not have deep pits on their occlusals. Aim and objective: Fidssures are most common in child due to deeppit and fissurous areas on the surface of teeth which need to been prevented or restored. These areas make them susceptible towards dental carys, which require to be prevented from or repaired. They also reduce the risk of infection because they are so light weight. After 24 months, there was no difference in retention between the three different material groups. For example, one group had only dry, wet, and artificially saliva-contaminated surfaces while the other had flowable composites like Tetric EVO flow. Retention rates were established for all three treatment groups except for the first group where each patient had reealed at least two teeth. Caries present or carious absent were determined by using Chi-square test. Results showed that the highest retention ratio was found for Helioseseal Clear Croma, but when compared to conventional sealants such as Delton opaque, these results were not statistically significant. Furthermore, some studies suggest that sealing agents can help prevent future carries."

The results suggest that higher levels may lead to increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. A case-control trial is used to assess the association between tumor necroses factor and adipotic cell volume, serum Tnf-alpha,soluble TNFreceptor 2, and indirect measures of inflammation in overweight and obesity patients. There is no significant change in heart disease risk markers; however, there are no differences in body weight, body composition, waist circumferential changes, or blood sugar concentrations. This study investigates the use of calcium plus Vitamin D as an intervention for improved health in healthy adults with very low amounts of mineral content. It was found that greater consumption of these two nutrients could be associated with better health. However, evidence from other studies suggests that it is not possible to predict the effects of either type of diet alone."
30338526,"In this study, we examine the effect of an infant formula containing whey and coconut milk on allergic disease. We conclude that it reduces the time for the gut to transit by two-horrified infants in comparison with conventional cow's milk or soy formulas. This study also determines whether breast feeding is associated with increased risk of Type 1 diabetes. The results suggest that early exposure to complex foods may increase the susceptibility of children with high-risk genetic diseases such as Type 1, but there are no intact protein in extensively hydrozed formulae. A double- blind trial has been conducted in which infant girls with HLA Conferred Suspectibility receive either repletely hydrolysed casein formula or puffed-milk formula at birth. These studies have not yet been published; however, they provide important information about the effects of different diets on the health of newborns during their first three months of life."
12962544,"In this double blind, oxaline-disruptive trial of 28 patients with duchenne muscular Dystrophy, we demonstrate that the side effects of both steroid treatment are mild cushingid appearance and moderate in one patient. After 9 months, all changes are statistically significant for the treated groups. Side effects after 9 month of treatment include mild Cushingoidic appearance in 4 patients, moderate to only one, seven %; increased appetite in 7 %), increased body weight in four, and irritable and hyperactive in three. We follow the patients every 3, months for 1year evaluating four legs muscles with the medical research council scale and performances of four functions: walking / climbing stairs'move  and rising from an appointment &#8216side effects weremonished by... question naire' and by routineblood examination! The two steroids proved equally effective in improvement of motor function and performance at 12 months. Another study has been performed on 102 boys with Duchesenne Musculty who received daily prenisone as early as 5 days after starting treatment. Both regimens improved their strength and function significantly. A six-month double-blinded controlled trial was conducted in 105 boys age 5 to15 years with DMD. The results showed similar improvements in muscle function but no significant differences in time or severity of symptoms. Two different studies have shown that prednistone improves strength in Du Chenne Muskel Dyffection. One study shows that it is possible to reduce the dosage ofprednizone needed by using azathioliprine, which can be used to treat conticosteroidal-responsive diseases"
28410504,"In older humans, endotheal dysfunction is associated with less Nitric oxide and prostaglic and in PG-mediated vasodenation. Ageing also increases the risk of endosthelial breakdown by increasing blood flow. Acute analgesis reduces the time required to perform repetitive lifting and lower tests in patients with low back pain. The results suggest that long-term exercise can prevent these complications. This study examines forearm bleeding changes after a single dose of acetiliclcholine as well as other anti-aging agents. It concludes that exercise has some positive effects on physical determinant and on all function ability outcomes."
29990473,"In this study, we examine the effects on body weight in patients with Type 2 diabetes who are not able to gain weight by diet alone. We conclude that alpha lipoic-acidic acid may be an effective treatment for these patients because of its anti-diabetic potential. This study is a prospective, double blinded placebo controlled trial designed to evaluate the effect of Alpha Lipoicaic acid on blood fat and lipid profile in rats. It was found that the consumption of high fat diets led to reduced body mass at the expense of improved body composition. The aim of the present paper is to investigate the efficaciousness of combinational therapy with alphospholipoc acid or urso deoxycholic acids on endotrium-dependent and independent vasodinase in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitateus. Aims: To assess the safety and efficiacy of combined treatment of alpholic acid and vitamin C in elderly patients suffering from age-related malcular degeneration."
24370176,"This paper focuses on the effects of early intervention on learning and behavior problems in preterm babies. It uses a prospective observational cohort of 1298 infants from birth through 15 years to examine the association between mild growth restriction during gestation and neonatal morbidity, cerebral palsies, and performance at school. The results are compared with those of healthy children from all age groups for numerous ""stand and ard"" mental and physical outcomes. In this study, we aim to determine motor, intellectual, or behavior-related outcome in prematurely weighed pregraced infant girls who have periventricular bleeding. Wechser intelligence scale, visual motor integration test,15-Wright Memory test and movement assessment battery were used as predictors. Preterm patients had very low birth weight before they reached school age. They also had retinopathies of prematism that prevented them from receiving appropriate education."
26061331,"This study aims to determine whether iron deficitiency may improve symptoms of patients who have heart failure, reduced left-ventricular eject fraction, and irondeficiencies. In this paper, the authors describe the use of iron sucrose in patients with anemia as a treatment option for those with severe or mildly acute bowel disease. They conclude that it is safe and efficacious to use iron sufate alone or in combination with FeS when compared to other agents in IBD. The results of this study indicate that Fes has superiority over either solution in terms of blood concentration and safety."
29306984,"This study focuses on the effects of exercise on bone mineral densitometry, body composition, and muscle strength in older adults. It compares resistance training to other forms of physical exercise for improving bone health. In this paper, we describe a trial that involves two groups of older women with fractures: one group is assigned to 'Osteocise' while the other is given control. The results of the trial indicate that both groups are effective at reducing falls in elderly women who have low bone mass. We conclude that ""muscle power"" or ""mass,"" as it is now called, is more important than muscle force or mass to reduce risk of falls. A multi-modal exercise program has been proposed to address these concerns. OsteoCisE was designed to evaluate the benefits and feasibility of an eight-month community-owned r and Omized controlled Trial, which included highvelocity walking drills, weight bearing impact exercises, balance training, gymnastics sessions, home training over 12 mo. Two hundred eighty Caucasian females aged 45-70 were recruited from Community Clinics; each had at least One VFs. These studies aim to assess whether group activity and coping Classes reduce physical and mental impairments and function in old women without frequent fracture history. They include nine months of total six-week exercise plus usual care. Bone mineral Densiton changes between base and nine month of bone Mineral Dentison increases by dual energy X-Ray absorpriometry and Serum Marks of Bon Resorption and formation. Efops trial clearly establishes the positive effect upon long-term exercising on clinical low trauma fractured subjects at risk. Although individual medication is typically well studied, studies that direct compare treatments are rarely performed. For example, there are no trials that directly compare treatment options."
15789890,"This paper focuses on the validity of outcome measures used in patients who have relapsed to rheumatic disease. It uses a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of cyclosposoline and low dose aspirin to assess the relative efficacy of these measures. The results indicate that physicians and patient-global measures are the most highly respondable. A new measure, the sickness impact profile, is developed to track changes in pain, physical function, and social status. In this study, we compare the health assessment question naire with the influence of diseases on health and lifestyle Questionnaire. We find that the HAQ is more sensitive than the other instruments for detecting changes over time."
21154394,"In this paper, we describe a double blinded, rand and ommized, parallel group, flexible dose, placebo controlled trial of quetitia pine augmentation for subjects who had inadequately responded to open label treatment with an epilepsy-reuptake inhibiting agent. This study is based on the results of two doubleblind studies: one in which patients were given either halopridol, another wherein patients received only paroixetine; and one that examined the effect of adding quetitiapine as an addition to srotonin reduction inhibitors in patients with severe obsesive compulsesive disorder. The authors conclude that although many patients benefit from treatment by using serotonein re uptake inhibitions, it is believed that half of these patients do not receive adequate response to these agents. Although some patients have been found to respond adequately to such treatments, there are still unrequited patients. A recent study has shown that quitiane can be used as augmenting antipsychotic when combined with rosperidone or fluvoxamamine."
31745834,"In this paper, we report the first controlled trial evidence of antithropolysis on elderly patients with acute atrial fibrillation. We compared the effects of warfarin and aspirin on cognitive function among elderly people with atrium fibrillation in a prospective cohort study. The results were similar to those reported in contemporary practice. A total of 9,73 patients aged 75 years with an atary fib were recruited fromprimary care and re-and-omly assigned to war farin; target International Normalized Ratison, 2 - 3 ; or aspriin n= 485 mg/d. Methods This study was designed to evaluate patient outcome in clinical practice by rhythm control vs rate control strategies for treatment of attritial fibrilation: ""rhythm control"" is more effective than ratecontrol in terms of morbidities, mordeity, and qualityof life. Atrial fibriliation is the most commonly sustained arrhythmic disease in the absence Of treatment. However, there are few studies on the use of sotalola or propafranone in treating these patients."
31766052,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to breast cancer detection with two-dimensional mammography. They compare double reading methods for interpreting four different types of breast exams: Arm A -- 2D ;Arm B -- 3D + CAM / Arm C --2D+ 3d & Arm D -- synthesis based on second-view and third-reader reads. The results show that there is an excess of early-stage breastcancers in the intervening arm relative to control arm. Furthermore, they report that women who have been invited to annual mamography from age 40-41 are more likely to die than those who do not undergo regular Mammograms at all. This study also reports that it has been found that ""the ratio of predicted breastcancen mortality in both arms compared with the intervention arm"". It also shows that patients who had previously undergone conventional mambrography were much less risked than controls when comparing their pre-existing breast diseases. Finally, these studies suggest that adding three-dimension breasttomo morphology to traditional breast scans may lead to improved detection of disease-causing breastcarrying lesions."
20655610,"The Diabetes Prevention program, or DPP, is a lifestyle intervention that can reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes by as much as half in people with prediabittes. This study compares the delivery of group-based treatment to brief counseling only in adults who attend two semi- urban YMCAC facilities and have r and Omized blood glucose values of 100'199 mg per day. In this study, we examine changes in body mass, blood pressure, Hba1c, total cholesterol, and HDl-cholestere after 6 and 12, 12 months. A pilot study was designed to determine the efficability of an edited diet-exe exercise program in preventing/delaying Type II mellituse in subjects with impairing glucose tolerance. After comparing the results of the trial to those of other studies, it is concluded that there is no need for further investigation into the role of lifestyle changes on type 2 disease."
28178949,"This is a double blinded, placebo controlled study of patients who have major depression. They are assigned to either paroXetine, imipramin, or sertraline and the outcome is measured by Hamilton Depression Rating scale for depression as well as several other measures. In this study, we compare the safetyand efficacy effects of three different antidepressers: fluoxetine; fluvoxine ; and an over-the-top serotoninate reupTake inhibitor. We conclude that these two drugs are superior to placebo in terms of improving depressed moods. A second study investigates the effect of exercise on neuropsychological function in patients with mild to moderate Major Depressive disorder."
27027426,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective cohort study that compared the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in subjects with high blood pressure or induced hypertension. We assess the association between low-circulating concentrationsof 25-Hysteriamin D and risk for Type 2 disease in 5066 subjects free of hypotension at an early age."
24082796,"Over five years, 192 Chinese children with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder are treated in Hong Kong. The results of this study indicate that a combination of short-term treatment with hypnotism combined with an extended period of multimodal therapy improves the quality of life for patients with ADHD. In addition, it is found that more children receive combined treatment than does one or two treatments alone. This report concludes that there is no advantage in any form of treatment over meditative behavior therapy when compared to ""methylphenidate date alone"" or ""meteodate plus attention control."" However, all three treatments do not lead to improved health. A prospective follow-up analysis of 101 male adults who had been initially hyperactive during their childhood shows that they have worse educational, occupational, economic, social, and maritial outcomes than those without ADHD at ages 7 through 9 years."
27153869,"Mild Cognitive Impairment is a good-recognized risk factor for the disease. Although exercise has been shown to improve brain structure and performance in older adults with mild cognitive impairment, there is little evidence that exercise can prevent or treat this condition. This study focuses on the association between the plebeial allele of the Alzheimer's disease allotment and lifestyle-related risk factors. In this paper, we investigate the effects of resistance training and aerobic training on hippocramal volume and changes in memory. We conclude that these two treatments are associated with improved hip pocket size and change in memorized hip pockets. Dementius is common, costly, and highly aged. There is no effective prickly treatment for it. However, studies have suggested that physical activity may be an effective strategy for reducing the risk of dementia."
29728079,"This paper focuses on the relationship between body mass-index and tooth loss in older adults who live in their own homes rather than at an institution. It is a cross sectional study of 629 adults aged 65 years or older from the National diet and nutrition survey. In this paper, we examine the association between eating quickly and being overweight among Japanese university students. The aim of this study is to investigate whether diets that lead to weight loss are associated with total and central obesity in elderly Swedish women. A sample of 1,396 female subjects was included in the study; 1,304 male subjects were included as well. We examined the influence of various social and economic factors on overall health status and body composition. Our main aim was to determine whether teeth loss and dentures that were not repaired with prostheses could be related to waist circumference and blood pressure. Furthermore, it was found that chewing gum contributes to appetite and satiation in South Brazid elderly. Although there has been little evidence for these effects in studies of south brazil elders, our results suggest that poor oral status may also be involved with body fat."
24876777,"In this study, the relative efficacy to atypical and conventional antipsychoses in early-stage patients with schizophrenia is examined. The results of these studies suggest that haloperiddol, olazapine, and resperidone may be superior to their conventional agents in improving long-term performance in patients who are switched from one type of antipsyotic to another. A Chinese patient group with milder symptoms was included in this trial. This study uses an observational approach to assess changes in symptoms after three years of follow-up. It finds that there is remarkably little difference in quality of living among patients switching from cloza pine to lazeridole or risperdon; however, it does find some differences in the change in mental health at three months' time."
17943911,"Lactobacilus GG is shown to reduce the frequency of small intestinal inflammation in children with mild and moderate asymptomatic dermatis. In addition, it has been reported that probiotic treatment can improve symptoms of cow's milk allergic infants. This study compares the effects of two different levels of prebiotics on growth, general health, and gut-mobiity in free- living healthy infanthood. The first group contains BifiDobacterium Lactinus Rhamnosus atcc 53103; the second group includes Streptocooccus thermo Philus as well as other strains from various cultures. Atopic ecrozema was treated with both treatments during the first two years of life. Babies were divided into three groups: control group consisting of either Bfido bacteria or heat-enactivated LactoBACILLUS GRHMIX. After birth, babies were assigned to either one of three regimens: controls group consisted of 1 x 10, 7 colonyforming unit/g Each of BIfidinium latix and Stretchococcous thermophilus; or unsupplementmented formula. Infants received either an infant formula enriched with galactoligosacides or fructooligonsaccharidas. They were then measured for their stool characteristics, growth rate, side effects, etc. These studies showed that there was no significant difference in the weight gain or length growth rates between the two groups."
21920661,"In this paper, the authors describe a novel treatment for patients with interstitial cystitis. They use Cysta-Quercetin as an adjudicator and conclude that it is superior to Pentosansan Polysulfates sodium in treating these patients. A second study uses cyclosposolineA as another antinociception agent against interstitial disease. This first study results in relapses of symptoms after three months of treatment. The second trial uses intravesical cauldette-guierin as compared to placebo in improving pain and urgency in patients who are treated with Pps. Another study involves transvagilial massage in women with painful bladder problems. It is reported that pentospersan polysatisfate sodium has significant efficacy but no longer improves symptomatic response."
31405892,"The effect of high-dose 1,25-hydroxyvitadin D on bone mass in elderly people with Parkinson's disease is a result of defects in renal synthesis. In this study, we examine the effect that daily doses of 1,75-Dihydroxyvitmin D can reduce hip and other minor nonvertebrale fractures in old patients with severe heart failure. A double blind trial was performed to evaluate the effects of 1 g/day orally for 6 months on leg muscle strength. After 10 weeks, there was an increase in 25-Hydrovin D levels versus placebo at 12 weeks. This study compares the results of vitamin D plus alfacalcicol against those who received only placebo. Bone Mineral Density in the Second Metacarpals was measured by computed airway inflammation. Vitamin D has been shown to improve physical function but may extend beyond prevent Osteoprasis. Many studies have suggested that it is beneficial to use too low p value of one hundred milligrams per day. However, current evidence does not support this claim. For example, knee osteoarthritas are associated with reduced bone mineral density. These studies also suggest that higher levels of bloodthirsty vitamins may lead to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Although many observational studies suggest increasing incidence ofCVD among persons with low vitamin C status, interventional trials have not found any effect."
29626044,"Iron depletion is associated with improved endurance and muscle oxidative performance in animals. However, iron depleted women remain unclear about the effects of this condition on their health. In this study, we examine the effect of an eight-week iron regimen on endurance performance among iron-depressed women. We conclude that it will improve endurance capacity by improving ferritin as well as transferrin signal levels. The results suggest that treatment with iron may be more effective than other forms of iron therapy."
24367612,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the risk factors of surgery-site infection in children. He uses case-control studies to identify patients who have undergone surgical site infection and determines that no preoperative or post-operative factors were associated with such complications. This study is an attempt to establish the frequency and severity of surgical wound infection among elderly patients. The results of the study are as follows: 33% of patients had a surgical scarlet infection; 15 patients developed syphilis after surgery; and 17% of these patients received antibiotics. Although there has been no reported association between methicillin resistance disease and surgical sites infection, this study does not address the magnitude of problem resulted from it at the country level."
26629535,"The authors report that luridone, a new antipsychotic drug, significantly reduces the risk of major depressive disorder in bipolar I patients. They also examine the relationship between anxiety and the course of their patient's illness. Bipolar disorder has recurrent comorbity and is associated with poor quality of life, reduced role function, and greater risk for suicide attempts. A new psychological treatment, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, called MBCT, has been used to treat patients with biphosphoric disorder."
25644019,"The aim of our study is to determine whether hemeiron polypeptide, or Hippo, can be used as a novel iron-supplementation strategy in patients with chronic kidney disease. This trial was designed to evaluate the efficability of HIP for augmenting iron stores in DPO-treated patients after total hip and Kne replacement arthrosis. Both groups were similar in terms of transferrins saturation, haemologlobin, and other outcomes. In this paper, we describe an observational study that examined the effects of anemia in chronic dialysis dependent on iron status, blood transfusion, use of therapy associated with bowel bleeding, consumption of iron, etc. We conclude that there is no significant difference in change of haermogloin levels between these two groups. Anemia is common in people with non-digimal-dependent Chronic Kidney Disease but it is unknown if Oral Iron Polypeptidate is as effective As IV iron sufate in the treatmentof iron deficitiency anakemia. It is unclear whether either regimen will improve haormogen levels; however, both regimens have been shown to be superior to one another. Heart failure patients are often treated with mechanical iron because they lack sufficient iron supply. Acutely affected patients may develop anaemia due to their low iron content. There is speculation about whether iron therapy should be given alone or combined with alvenous iron. However, studies have shown that long-term censured FeSO4 does not lead to improvement in hemoglobine levels after surgery."
26323052,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective study using the Posttraumatic Stress Checklist to assess the performance of an instrument for assessing posttraumatic stress in women. The results suggest that scores of 30 and 50 are best for discriminating between cases and not-cases. We examine the efficacy of the self-reported PTSD checklist in mothers of childhood cancer patients. Mothers complete the question-naire self report ptdiment with several modules including the psyched disorder, generalized anxiety, and major depressive disorder modules. After ninety subjects return for their re administration of selected measures, finding support for psychometrical properties ofthe Psychedic Question-Report instrument designated to assessment symptoms of post trauma stress disorder. This article also discusses the comparison of telephone and in person structured clinical interview for DSMIV as an independent psychological diagnosis. It shows that veterans who suffer from combat stress react more frequently than those without it."
24362925,"This study focuses on the effects of exercise on patients with a chronic pain condition. Thirties women with her disease were assigned either to an aerobic exercise program or to stretching exercises for eight weeks. They showed significant improvements in pain, sleep, fatigue, tender point counts, and fitness during treatment. In addition, there was no significant change in anxiety or depression. The primary aim of this trial was to compare measures measuring exercise-induced changes in mood. It was found that both groups improved their symptoms significantly. A second study was designed to assess the efficaciacy of pyridiastigmine's anti-inflammatory effect on female patients who have fibromyalsgia. Although some studies have suggested that it may be beneficial to use self-help approaches such as meditation and deep breathing to improve health status, these studies are not well received."
30622734,"This study focuses on the effect of education and home-based exercises on patients with hip arthrosis. It is a double blinded, prospectioved controlled trial that compares the effects of two different types of stretching techniques on knee pain and injury. The first group receives isokinetic Muscle Strength training, while the second group gets propriotic neuromuscular Facilitation. In this study, we examine the results of an eight-week progressive resistance training program in patients suffering from rheuumatoic arthritis. We conclude that exercise does not induce changes within the blood mononullear cell population or proliferatory response; however, it does improve the function of the immune system. Furthermore, our study shows that strength training can improve disease activity and function in people with severe osteoartritis."
18418399,"In this paper, we describe a double blind, rand-omized prospective study of the safety and effectiveness of an IV infusion of either dihydrophosphodie calcium channel blocker or sublingual capstopril. The results indicate that both drugs are safe and effective for the treatment of patients with hypertension who have not responded adequately to either drug. We conclude that captopriml is more effective than nidipine because it lowers blood pressure quickly but does not increase heart rate. A second study compares two different forms of vasodinic agents used for treating acute pulsive emergencies: one using morphine and the other using furosemidate. This latter form of therapy is less expensive and requires shorter time in the hospital than its counterpart."
22232096,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of behavior therapy on weight loss and psychological well being in adults with Type 2 diabetes. Although initial weight losses are positively related to weight Loss at 30 months, they do not predict long-term or short- term weight gain. People who reach weight goals lose more quickly than those who have not. This is because people who lose their initial body weight before losing their physical health lose less quickly afterward. Anderson concludes that ""psychological well-being"" does not relate to initial changes in weight. He suggests that community workers should be trained to deliver an effective lifestyle intervention for individuals with type 2 disease."
29465026,"In this study, we examine the efficaciousness of a paroxen-controlled-release formulation compared with that of placebo in patients with Major Depressive disorder. We conclude that it is superior to either treatment group on several measures of depression and alcohol use. Although some studies have suggested that antidepressedants may be effective in treating both disorders, most studies do not show any significant differences between the two groups. Major depressives are common in older Americans, and few doubleblind, placebo-control trials have been performed for them. Late-life depression is one of the most common psychological problems in elderly Americans. Many antidespressants are implicated in sexual dysfunction, which may lead to dissatisfied patients"
29211740,"In this paper, we describe a novel approach to early intervention for infants with autism. We focus on two areas of delay: joint attention and symbolism. The first is short-term improvements in social communication skills; the second is long- term gains in language and social function. This study aims to improve underst or the market for child care in Saudi Arabia by testing whether access to inexpensive day care would incentimate that mothers search actively for work and remain employed once hired. A piloted trial of an early childhood intervention program for people with High-functioning Autism was conducted. Children with high-functionaling autism were assigned either to one of 2 groups: 1) Early Start Denver Method, which involves comprehensive group intervention; 2) parent-mediated communicative treatment; or 2) community-based intervention. These children showed significant improvement in adaptive behavior, language, and emotional relentance after the initial phase of the training. Parents who had been trained received more reinforcement than those who did not receive any further training because they felt their children's interaction with them improved. They also found that imitation training was more effective than other forms of early education for children with severe autistic disorders. Their results suggest that early approaches may have important effects upon core defects in young children without prior experience."
28474733,"This study focuses on the use of lamotripine as an antipsychotic in children with Bipolar I disorder who are experiencing a severe depressive episode. It is based on evidence from three British Association forPsychocology Guides, which recommend that patients be treated according to their severity and frequency of symptoms. The authors conclude that this treatment should be extended over several weeks. They also describe other studies designed to assess the effects of different types of mood-stabilizers on bipolar disorder. Lithium has been shown to be more efficacious than placebo in treating pediatric depression. Aripiprozole seems to have some promise when compared to another antidepressante; however, there is no concluding evidence regarding its safety."
31616340,"In this study, we examine the effects of a diet high in fish and the alpha-alpha fatty acid on brain function in overweight adults. We find that body mass is associated with poorer executive function and lower motor function than does eating behavior. Brain function is also related to weight loss. A recent study suggests that exercise training may be effective for improving executive functions in patients with obesity."
26449638,"In this paper, the results of a systematic review of published studies regarding the use of glass Ionomer Cement in the treatment of teeth are presented. The most commonly found reasons for gaps in trials are lack of sufficient trial precision and absence of adequate sample size. This study is an attempt to test the efficacy of different types of cements on different patient populations. It uses naive-indirect compares between competing treatments as evidence from separate controlled trials. A total of eight96 citation were identified through systemic literature search. From these studies, tenand two uncontrolled control trials for HVGAC and amalgam were included for direct comparisons. pain during invasive tooth treatment is common phenomenon. If no local analsgesia had been used before preparation of the tooth, it has yet not yet been proved that this particular technique really causes more pain than with conventional techniques. Art therapy is based upon removing infested tooth material by using only hum and instruments and then filling the cleaned cavity with an adhesive material like glass IIonOmer."
16530201,"In this study, we examine the effect of consumption of fish oils on lipid composition and blood pressure. We conclude that fish oil has deleterious side effects on these two conditions. Type 2 diabetics are randomed to vitamin E or corn oil for 8 weeks before they receive an elective coronary Angioplasty. After eight weeks, subjects were assigned either to consume 15mL of seal oil or 10ml of corn-oil. Both groups showed significant reductions in total cholesterol and lipophosphoprotein concentrations. The results of this trial indicate that omega-3 fatty acids can improve heart health as well as reduce risk of stroke. This study is a doubleblind, placebo controlled trial designed to determine whether alpha-lenic acid, which is converted into docosanoic acid does not have any anti-inflammation effects. It was found that it reduced triacyl glycocerides by 21 % when compared with corn Oil. Furthermore, it improved serum lipostogenerol levels significantly. A further study investigates the efficacy of long chain n-3 fats on cardiovascular disease."
24585482,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effect of pre-operative informed consent on patients' knowledge of anecdote and pain during laparoscopic surgery. He uses a multi-modality approach to assess the impact of patient education on pain, anxiety, and post-anesthesia recovery. The results suggest that ""pre-operating informative session"" can be used to improve patient understanding of the complications of elective surgical procedures."
27765009,"The purpose of this study is to describe the self-reporting health care use, and on perceptions of health problems, in patients with generalized anxiety disorders. In this paper, we examine the patient's response to questions about worry and anxiety as compared to their responses to other symptoms. We conclude that fatigue is a frequently encountered condition in general practice; however, there is little evidence for its association with physical or mental health. Fatigue has been defined as ""chief complaint fatigue"" but many patients do not meet the definition. This paper describes the relationship between fatigue and psychological factors in primary care."
25003202,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the quality of reports of controlled trials in hip and knee Ostearthritis. He discusses the use of pro-reporting checklist items to improve the reliability of these reports. The Pro-Reporter is a tool that helps physicians assess the efficability of different types of treatments for patients with different levels of pain. Anderson then describes the Consotr Pro extension of the Consolr statement regarding reporting of patient reported outcomes. This extends an existing guideline by recommending that all trials report ""primary or important end points"" as well as specific limitations of study results and generalizizability"
25978537,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights focuses on the effects of ""active"" or ""sedentary"" video games on weight and body composition in children. The study uses a mixed-effects model to examine the effect of physically active and emotionally charged game playing on overweight and obese patients. A total population of 322 healthy children aged 10-16 years were randomly assigned either an active or no-play group. This is important because it does not reveal the specific efficacy of any particular active game when delivered in the context of child weight management. However, there are other studies that suggest that active gaming may be more effective than physical activity training. Children who participate in community-based behavior change programs are particularly vulnerable to these effects. Although many of these studies have been published, few have directly examined the use of active entertainment for improving physical health. For example, one study suggests that ""activity-promoting"" activities such as boxing and tennis can be used to increase energy expenditure by reducing the number of times children are idle during their free play."
18334813,"This paper focuses on the reliability of the manual muscle testing method, or ""MT,"" as it is now called. Its purpose is to present an historical overview, literature review, description, and critique of its reliability and validity. The authors use the original Consolri date d InTRODUCtion, which was first published in 1915, to describe the current state of scientific research on this test. A number of studies have been published since then, but no one has yet published a formal report on RCTs."
31118956,"In this paper, we report on the effects of a pro-biotic strain called Lactobacilus gassersi BNR 17 on body weight. We conclude that it is possible to use these strains as an anti-obsity treatment in overweight and obesity-prone subjects. This study compares the effect of two different types of probiotic regimens on fat mass and body composition in women. The first group consumes kefir while the second contains no probiota at all."
25086121,"In this study, we aim to determine whether the influence of varus-aligning on knee function is different in patients who undergo patient-specific guided instrumentation. We systematically follow a cohort of 214 knee surgeons who have undergone TKA for osteoarthritis. Forty five patients were treated with conventional instruments and 23 were assigned to PSI. The results are as follows: the tial component rotation is 0.0 o'clock in group A and 1.0 d'angle in groups B. This study furthermore compares the accuracy of PSG-based alignment to that of conventional instrumentations. It was hypothesizes that using such an accurate guide will improve the precision of the surgical process."
18461255,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of multiple stretching sessions per day on improving the health of men and women who have limited hamlet muscle flexibility. He uses a cross-sectional design to examine the relationship between physical therapist beliefs, attitudes, knowledge, and behavior regarding evidence-based practice in order to determine whether these attributes are related to quality of treatment. The results of this study indicate that physical therapy is more effective when evidence is used than when it is not"
20921070,"In this study, we examine the pain severity of children undergoing office-meatotomy. We assess whether physicians perceive pain differently due to age, gender, duration of illness, or anesthesia regimen. The results indicate that mepivaaine is not as effective in relieving pain after outpatient surgery for children with severe pain. Acute Otitis media is common in young children and has not been thoroughly studied. Children receive topical eardropses instead of a placebo during their acute otitious treatment. This study compares two methods of local anesthesis before cannulling in children: euteictic mixture of Lidocaine and prilucaine; and Elitemax Plus Hynosis. These studies are designed to improve pain management in patients who have received both types of medicine. They also evaluate the use of fingersticks to reduce pain perception among pre-school children. Preparations for minor surgical procedures are difficult because they involve multiple needle wounds and require careful preparation. Parents provide instructions on how to manage pain and avoid painful situations. Post-operative pain scores are calculated using the WONG-Bakers Pain Rating Scaler. After tonsillectomy, children report pain intensity and anxiety at the endof the first post-surgery session."
22972106,"In this study, the effects of a hyperintensified normoglyccaemic clamp on patients who undergo open heart surgery are investigated. The results indicate that they have lower blood glucose concentration and shorter time of ventilation than those treated with conventional subcutaneous infusion. This study is designed to determine whether strict control of bloodglucose will improve myomycardial performance after major surgery or critical illnesses. It is based on two parallel groups: one group uses an intense insulin regimen to reduce morbidity while the other uses standard methods to control bloodglyciemia. These studies aim to assess whether tight control can improve patient outcome during surgical intervention. A pilot study was conducted to compare the safety and effect of an intensified-insulin potassium regimen against conventional approaches in general intensive medical care unit patients. Both regimens resulted in reduced mortality and improved long-term outcomes. However, these studies did not lead to any significant changes in patient health."
11405989,"Iron-depleted anemics receive lower mental test score than nonanemiamic infants after three months of iron treatment. The results are similar to those of other studies, suggesting that extended iron therapy may be able to improve mental and motor performance in iron-deprived infant populations."
23478741,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates that exercise training can improve walking ability for people who have had stroke. He describes the results of a two-band, factorial design in which cycle training and resistance training were used to train subjects with recent strokes or transient Ischemia attack. The outcome of the trial was fatal or notfatal stroke; however, it was associated with major cardiovascular events. This study is an attempt to develop an integrated care program for stroke survivors. It focuses on patient education and follow-up. Acute stroke patients are divided into two groups: intervention groups receive instruction about physical activity before discharge and control group receive usual care. Although evidence suggests that risk factor reduction may be beneficial in preventing future heart attacks, few studies have examined the effects upon long-term health improvement after stroke treatment."
22041232,"This study aims to evaluate the effect of an ERAS-based care program on patients' mortality and morbity after open colorectinal surgery. In this study, patients were matched with their type of surgery, the Type of Surgery: Pompe-possum, Cr-possum/Colored-Posesum, physiological and operationive Score for EnUMeration of Morbidity and Mortality. The main outcome measures were mortality or morbidness. A fast-track approach was used in this trial because it had been shown to improve patient outcome by improving pain, fatigue, and postoperative complication. It was found that patients who underwent rapid rehabilitation received better results than those treated with conventional care. However, there was a significant delay in the recovery of these patients due to stress-induced injury and fatigue. After elective colonial resection, many patients required early mobilization as well as early food and rest. These studies have not yet been published."
30886887,"This paper describes a new approach to improving blood pressure in the rural South. It is based on an evidence-based, patient-centered intervention that involves community health workers. The results of the study are as follows: 1) women with Type 1 diabetes mellitateus who have been referred to by faith community nurses or physicians for treatment improve their overall health and quality of life; 2) African American women without Type 2 diabetes receive better care than Caucasians; and 3) men with type 2 do not experience improved health after attending one of these two groups. In this paper, we describe the effects of telemedicine services on patients with elevated Hba1c levels. We conclude that it is important to use evidence from studies focused on task shifts to understand how vulnerable populations are identified and measured."
23825185,"The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of a high-fructose diet on blood metabolite concentrations in healthy adults. Thirty healthy adult volunteers were divided into two groups: those with hyperinsulinmic and nonhyperirritinemic response. Ten men consumed either 0.5 or 0.8 g/day of fructosol, respectively. These men showed increased levels of lipoprotein, apoprotein B-100, C- II,C-III,and uric Acid. Fifteen percent of their total kcalocalories came from fructomedes, which were found to be more effective at reducing blood glucose than cornstarch. In this study, we examined the effect of both sugars on fasting and insulin secretion in patients with type 2 diabetes. We conclude that an increasing amount of fiber or sugar in the diet may lead to changes in fat and lipid profiles in these patients."
31576905,"This is a first-in-man study to investigate the effect of interval training on patients with severe obstrutive pulmonary disease. Twenty-seven patients were assigned to either interval or continuous training, and they were then divided into four groups: long slow distance, Lactate threshold, 3 x 15 interval running, 4 X 4 min of intervalve training. Both groups showed improvement in quality of life after the training regimen. The aim was to determine whether interval exercise training improves heart rate variability in patients who have moderately ill lungs. In this study, we examine the effects of three-month interval/continuous training program on lung function in adult patients suffering from mild to severe chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease."
24516794,"This paper describes a prospective, random-experimental study of long-serious atrial fillation patients treated between the years of 2006 and 2009 who underwent either surgical or catheter ablation. The results of this study indicate that both methods are effective in treating these patients. In particular, it shows that the concoctant surgery using ""salineirrigated cool tip radiofrequency Ablation"" is more successful than the conventional approach of circumferential vein isolation. It also suggests that there may be an advantage to the use of electrodes on the patient's arm to prevent recurrent arrhythmian occurrences."
26497361,"The effect of choline fibrate on carotidas intima-media thickness in subjects with Type IIB Dyslipidemic with Residual Risk in Addtion to Atorvalin therapy is described. This study was performed by a doubleblind, placebo controlled trial in patients who had low levels of lipophosphoprotein cholesterol and were at risk for coronary disease or stroke. In this study, the rate of change of posterior wall cImt measured by ultrasound was similar to that of Acorvastain monotherapy. Although cardiovascular diseases are common in men with renal incompetence, no studies have focused specifically on people with low highdensity LDL level. However, we do conduct an observational post-hoc sub-group analysis of two trials: one comparing gemfirzil to placebo in 2532 men without established coronarry disease; and another evaluating whether bezafaribate can prevent myomyocardial heart disease in individuals with lower blood fat. These studies involved 1568 men aged between 35 and 92 years. They were recruited through eight practice s from the British Medical Council General Practice Renewal Framework and through 9 hospital vascular centers. The treatment consisted of either statin or placebo. After three years, these patients received both regimens. Their primary outcome was their first occurrenceof nonfatal Myo Cardioal Infa Rct Ion or sudden Death. Bezafiebration increased HDLcholestrol levels by 18 %) and reduced TTriglyceris by 21 0%. Both drugs were safe and well tolerated. There were no significant differences in serum lipoprotein levels in the other groups."
27317033,"This study aims to compare the safety and potential of percutaneous draining of the gallbrodder to an emergency choecystentectomy in patients with severe acute calculous or acalculously cholecciasis. The results of this study are as follows: there is no significant difference between conversion rates, operating times, postoperative complications, or post-opportunities. A prospective i v r and Omized trial was undertaken to determine whether early laparcooscopic surgery should be performed within 24 hours after admission or delayed interval surgical treatment after initial medicaltreatment. In this case, it was followed by delayed Laparoscopic Choe Cystoplasty. There was not significant differences in conversion rate, operation times; postopéranitis requirements; or pre-Opposions. Flaw's in the designs, conduct, analysis, and reporting can cause the effects of an interventionto be underestimated nor overestimate."
26824223,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft discusses the increasing epidemic of cardiovascular diseases in sub- Saharan Africa. He argues that there is little evidence for a cost-effective strategy to prevent such an epidemic from reaching epidemic proportions in other parts of the world. The study also describes how practice nurses can be used as effective interventionists by helping patients with high blood pressure manage their risk. Wolstonecamp's main aim is to compare the effectiveness and cost benefits of community-based health checks and lifestyle counseling to those offered by conventional medical practices. This trial will assess the efficacy of two different approaches: 1) general health check-ups and 2) self-evaluation of lifestyle changes. Both groups receive regular health exams and follow up visits after five years. These studies are important because they provide information on the relative risks of various disease states and suggest that these issues may lead to improved health status among older adults."
27600634,"The aim of the present study is to determine whether a new type of total knee replacement, using an advanced surgical robot, can be more accurate and less traumatic than conventional methods. In this paper, we describe the results of two different types of knee surgery: minimally irritated complete kneearthroplasty and conventional knee arthrosis. We conclude that the use of such devices has potential for improving the accuracy of component positioning and mechanical axe-alignment. A prospective cohort study compares the short-lived functional outcome of minimalily invasive and auto-assigned total Knee Arthuroplasty with those of traditional total joint articulation. Although there are several studies reporting improved outcomes in these two groups, no significant differences in alignment are found between the two group. This study furthermore examines how surgeons who perform TKA on patients with severe gonarroscopic disease may differ from those who undergo conventional procedures."
30519012,"In this paper, we examine the use of a retropulsion test in patients with Parkinson's disease to assess posturography. We find that there is no significant relationship between the Retropulsion Test and backward sway during the off phase of the study but no association between it and the on phase. This suggests that physicians must be more familiar with evidence-based medicine than they are with traditional medicine."
28673352,"In this study, we examine the effects of fish oil on Type 2 diabetes. The results indicate that a diet high in n-3) polyunstained fatty acids may be more beneficial than other anti-disease agents. We also investigate the effect of omega-3 and ecotasapenteoic acid on blood pressure, lipids, and cell function in type 2 patients with hypothyroidism. This study is an attempt to determine whether or not these two different types of fats have any positive effects on both glyceria and systemic disease in patients who are hypertrigallyceridemia. It was found that they had significant effects upon lipoprotein concentration, insulin  sensitivity, as well as on glucose levels. Furthermore, it was concluded that either treatment would improve their ability to control blood flow and reduce their risk of heart attack."
18685403,"The verbal nrs and the visual analog scale are used to rate the severity of breathlessness in subjects with advanced lung disease. A battery of instruments is needed to track changes in health status, but it is not yet validated. In this study, we examine the effect of exercise on patients with asthma who have severe airflow limitation. We use the Six-Minute Walk test to assess patient's response to exercise and then compare its performance with that of the other two tests. Both measures show significant improvements over the standard six-minute walk test. This study also uses a self-report question naire as an instrument to measure the effects of treatment on improving quality of life for patients suffering from chronic air flow limitation"
31578051,"This is a prospective, observational study of the impact of an education and home-based exercise program on patients with acute ankylosizing spondies.

He describes how these exercises are divided into four groups: 1) group 1 performs strength exercises; 2) group 2 does not perform any exercises at all; and 3) group 3 uses only one type of exercise. After eight weeks, both groups show improvement in joint mobility, functional capacity, pain and depression. Although physical therapy continues to be recommended for managing anthropically ill patients, there is still some evidence that exercise can help."
23848480,"This study focuses on the effects of constrained movement therapy on patients with chronic stroke. In this study, we compare the effect of two different types of therapy: constraint-induced movement and bimanual treatment. The control group has better results than the comparison group for improving upperlimb function. A prospective study is designed to determine whether combined use of nervemuscular electrical stimuli and dynamicbracing is more efficacious than either alone in treating children with spasticity. Sixteen children are assigned to three groups; one group receives two 30-minute session of NMES per day applied on an antagonist exctensor without bracting; the other group uses dynamic braces every day. After six months, all patients are evaluated before and after using the garment. Two measures of outcome are taken: the Melbourne assessment, grip strength, and posture examination with Zancolli's classification. These studies were followed by a further study that examined the effectiveness of modified constraints-induced motion therapy as compared to bimenual training. It was found that both intervention had superior outcomes for children who had congenital distal palsy. Children with hysterical orphaned hemisplegia were divided into two groups: intense occupational therapy or ""modified constrainit-based therapy"". There was no difference in performance between these groups. However, they did have significant differences in unimanual capacity at 26, weeks."
20459730,"This study focuses on the effects of exercise on patients who have a diseased musculonoskeletal condition. The results suggest that exercise is superior to stretching and other forms of physical exercise for improving pain, quality of living, and health-related qualities in patients with this disease. In addition, the authors describe thastolotherapy as an effective treatment for patients suffering from fibroyalgiA. They conclude that ""pyrdidtigmine"" improves symptoms by improving the acute response caused by low levels of Insulin-like Growth Fact 1 and reduced growth hormone. A second study investigates the effect of swimming pool exercises on women with fagital Golia. It was found that swimmers had greater pain scores than did control groups; however, they were also more likely to be satisfied with their swim sessions."
31461458,"This paper focuses on the effects of community-based insurance on blood pressure control in rural Nigeria. It finds that health spending is reduced for those with compulsory and voluntary insurance, but that this effect disappears once the individual effects are observed. In addition, the overall reduction in outof pocket expenditures is greater for enrollee's using higher-level public health services than those using lower-class hospitals. Since the early 1990s, there has been a movement to establish ""community-base health insurance"" schemes as an effective way to improve access to health care in developing countries. However, these schemes do not have any positive effects on health outcomes. For example, one study found that children who were covered under the CBHI scheme had fewer chances of getting sick or dying than their peers who did not receive the same treatment. Furthermore, it appears that the incentive to provide better care leads to poorer health outcome."
23473733,"In this study, we examine the association between whole-graine and refined grain consumption in relation to the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. We find that a diet rich in whole grains is associated with fewer risk factors for type 2, but only refined grains are associated at higher risk than whole grain. The effect of the diet on blood pressure was studied in patients with pre-diabsorption stage 1 hypertensies. After 8 weeks, body weight and waist circumference reduced significantly after following the Dairy Approaches To Stop Hypertension: Eating pattern on Cardiometabolic Risks in Type 2 Diabetes. This study uses the Dash approach to stop hypotension as an alternative to conventional treatment. It reduces fasting blood glucose by reducing oxidative stresses caused by obesity. Furthermore, it improves insulin resistance and increases antioxidant capacity. Blood pressure is also reduced in subjects with low-salcoium diets."
23935716,"In this study, we compare the short-lived results of two different types of prostheses used for total kneearthroplasty: fixed bearing and rotating platform. The first is a prospective, double-blinded trial in which 100 knees are assigned to one type of device or another. After six months, they are compared with their pre-operating scores on the Knee Society Score and Oxford Score. Both groups show good results after surgery. A further study is performed wherein patients receive either fixed bearing or rotating bearing devices. This study determines whether there is any difference in functional outcomes between the two group. It is concluded that both groups have improved knee function over the previous three years."
23375241,"In this double blinded trial, 420 patients aged 45 years old with a complete International Prostate Score of 13 to 16 were given tam'sulosesin or extended-release alpha1 blocker for 12 weeks. The primary outcome is change from baseline on total Ury Tract symptoms after 12 week of treatment. This study investigates whether combination therapy can be more effective than monotherapy in improving the relative risk of acute urinary retainment, AUR, BPH related surgery, and Crash clinical progression over four years in men who have moderately to severe lower Urry Traction symptoms. It was concluded that combination treatments are superior to monotherapies in terms of improved symptoms and long term outcomes."
29877887,"This study focuses on the role of platelet activity in the pathophysiological state of patients with left-ventricular assist devices, such as HeartMate I, HeartWare V, and HeartWave Hvad. It is shown that this effect is not due to an overly fast response of the device, but rather because it is related to the development of severe thrombosis."
30007275,"This study consists of two independent, controlled studies. The first is a parallel-arm trial in which overweight or obese patients are assigned to different diets for their weight loss and blood pressure control. In the first group, they lose more weight than the second group after six weeks on either low fat or low carbodytic diet. Both groups lose greater weight during this period than when they were initially assigned as controls. A second study compares the effects of ""low-fat"" or ""high-carbogenic"" high-protein/monounstastained fat diet's with those of an energy-deficient diet; these subjects lose less weight but improve their health. Another study examines changes in endotolhelial cell function in type 2disease patients by using recurrent measurements of body mass index and waist circumferentiality. These results suggest that there may be some benefit in changing the amount of carbohydrates consumed in people with Type 2, although it is not clear whether this effect is due to increased lipoprotein concentrations or improved glyceride content."
26803696,"In this paper, the Danish fracture-data base is established to assess whether a percutaneous compression plat or proximal nail Antirotation is superior to sliding hip screw for treating intertrochantesric fractures. The results of this trial are presented in this manuscript. A prospective study was carriedout from January 2008 until October 2011 comparing the clinical effectiveness with the percutive compression plate versus pricipal femor nail antirotations in the treatment and management"
25099546,"In this paper, we examine the effect of a diet high in fiber on blood concentrations and other liver functions. We compare two different types of diets to determine which is more likely to lead to fatty liver diseases. The first is based on an open-label study with 32 overweight men assigned to groups that receive either 'high-frucose' or high-glyceric' diet for 2 weeks. This study was designed to assess the extent of reporting bias in trials by comparing the number of missing outcome measures from all eligible studies. A nine point categorical classification system was developed to identify the most frequently missed outcome outcomes among all available trials. More than half of the review results were missing for any reasons; however, 50 % nor more of potential data were misses in 70 / 25 %) reviews. Although there are many studies showing the effects of consumption of fructoses on biological markers involved in the development of Metabolic Syndrome, it is not well known whether they are associated with fat mass or ectopy. Therefore, our aim is to investigate the relation between carbolic quality and levels of sugar, starch, and fiber in healthy subjects. It is found that these foods have been shown to be beneficial in terms of improving liver function. However, no single study has yet examined the association between weight loss and risk of nonalcoholic disease."
24824056,"In this study, we examine the effect of total Arch distalization with orthodontic miniimplants combined with interproprimal stripping. We compare the results of three treatment methods: attachments alone; interproxial reduction only; and neither attachment nor interprimimal reduction. The aim is to assess the roughness of untreated enamel surfaces after application of current available interpoxal polishing."
31321227,"Walking tests are useful for assessing balance in older people with amputation. The Brief-Bestest test is particularly useful because it can predict falls in people who have Parkinson disease. In this study, eighty patients with the disease complete relapse after seven months of illness. A new version of the test, called the Timed Up and Go test or ""Tug,"" has been developed to assess walking ability in elderly people. This study compares the performance of these tests with that of other commonly used tests such as the Berg Balance test and the dynamic gait index. It also determines whether the scores of both tests may be affected by changes in the severity of old age."
25353646,"In this study, we examine the effects of electrodestimulation on muscle strength in patients with acute obstrumentive disease. We assess the effect of electrical muscle stimulation on quadrateps muscles in critically-ill patients. Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation is used to determine the severity of the illness. After an initial period of mechanical ventilation, patients are assigned either to receive electric muscle stimulation or to control group. Muscle loss is measured by serial ultrasound. The results indicate that there is a significant loss of mass in the severely ill patient."
23967064,"This paper focuses on the relationship of physical activity to risk of stroke. It is not well established whether this association depends on leisure time, occupation, or a combination of both. The results suggest that walking and bicycling can be used as an intervention to reduce stroke risk in people with varying levels of leisure-time, occupational, and merrimentary activities. A self-help intervention called the ""Walk in to Work out"" has been shown to increase exercise for people who are physically active but have no history of heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, etc. Although some studies have found negative associations between mild or moderately active physical activities and all-caluse mortality, others have failed to predict the exact cause of death. Walking and riding to school are considered one of the best ways to prevent Type 2 diabetes, but there is still uncertainty about the effect of these different types of exercises on blood pressure."
19776505,"The aim of Dr. Watts's study is to compare the effects of a bone matrix, ABM, with modified flap surgery on periodontale defects. In this study, patients were treated in two different ways: 1) using enamel matrix proteins or 2) using bovine-porous bone mineral. Both methods resulted in improvement in depth and pocket depth. After four years, all defects were repaired by either EMD or GTR. At the end of the trial, no significant differences were found between the two treatment groups. This was an attempt to assess the effectiveness of three different surgical procedures for treating deep interproxiummal Introbony defects; however, there were no differences in terms of baseoral hygiene and defect characteristic among the three groups indicating that they were effective."
12804434,"This study focuses on the effects of two different exercise regimens over a two-year period on falls and their subsequent sequelae in older adults. The first group is progressive resistance training, while the second is basic enhanced programming. In this study, subjects are assigned either to one or two exercise groups: resistance/endurrance plus basic improved programming or 'tai Chi' Plus basicEnhanced Programm'. A healthy elderly man with chronic claudicious knee pain is given an exercise program that includes three sets of exercises at 80 %) of one repetitionmax for eight repeats per week. He also compares the effect of walking exercise with strength training. Two studies have been performed on patients with intermittent heart failure. One has shown improvement in functional status after 12 weeks of vigorous resistance weight training; the other has examined changes in self-esteem among older people who were not involved in any physical activity before. These studies include the Sendais Silver Center Trial, which was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise training as well as improvements in health function among free-living elders. It uses both center-based and home-based nursing homes. All residents except those with terminal prognoses are eligible except some with severe pregnant disease. They are divided into two groups by age and gender. Each group receives six months of active daily living activities. Both men and women are asked to attend classes at the senday silver center twice p.m. each day. After these sessions, they are instructed to walk or stretch or to sit down. There is no significant difference in change in outcome variables between the groups. Muscle remodeling and functional adaptation to exercise and food intervention were studied. Fifty-five eligible subjects aged from sixty to 78 years were assigned to control groups or another group. To assess the efficaciousness of 18 month aerobic walking and strong training programs on posturity among old adults with knee Ostritus. Although there is little evidence regarding the long-term benefit of resistancetraining on bone mass, we do know that it improves bone mineral denition and biochemical marker of bone turnover. We examine the results of spinal muscle strength by loading exercises upon the bone Mineral Density of the spine, and the influence of upper extremities loading forces on bones in healthy older individuals. Age-matched subjects were assigned to either an 8-Wk resistive training program or control group -- C = 74+ /- 7 years"
24212996,"This paper updates the evidence base for the treatment of caries in children. Its primary aim is to assess whether there is a difference between the efficacy and safety of two different types of sealants, one produced with an elevated-powder-liquid ratio and the other with resin-based material. In this study, dentists apply both kinds of materials on 407 children aged 8 years who have at least one pit or fissure that contains traces of tartar. The results show that the first-molar sealant applied on these children has remarkably good results."
29615407,"A randomized, controlled trial compares the effects of high-Glycemic Index diets on weight loss in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that low-GI or high Glycemia Index may be more effective in reducing blood sugar levels in type 2 patients. In addition, it is suggested that a combination of these three different types of food may lead to improved blood pressure and reduced risk of heart attack in overweight subjects. This study also examines whether adding viscous fat to eat at an amount prescribed by the U.S. Food label will affect gastricempting, postpran and ieal glucose concentrations."
25532993,"This paper reports on the results of a prospective, observational study of women with post-menopause type 2 diabetes. Its primary aim is to examine the association between hot flashed skin sensations and changes in health related quality of life during the menstrual transition. Women were eligible for this study because they had an unattractive uterus and were not using any other form of contraceptive medicine. The study was designed to compare two methods for assessing frequency of hot flushes: paper diaries and electrodes placed on each patient's skin conductance track."
21925051,"In this study, we compare the efficaciousness of rate control and rhythm control for patients with atrium fibrillation. We conclude that a rate-control strategy will be more effective in terms of survival and morbidity than standard treatment. ARBs may also reduce the occurrence of atrial fibrillation after successful electrical cardioversion; however, there is little evidence to support this claim. Atenolal or amalodipine are better at preventing the repeat of an episode of arrhythmy in patients who have recently had paroxysms. The aim here is to compare two antiarrhythmically agents: valsatan and amlo dipine. This trial was designed to evaluate whether either regimen would prevent the repetition of episodes of heart failure. Both regimens were well tolerated by both groups. However, they did not show any significant improvement in short-term results."

26883234,"This study focuses on the impact of various surgical procedures on patients with Crohn's disease in terms of quality of life, recovery, and costs. The results suggest that there is a significant relationship between speed of healing and perceived stress. A negative correlation exists between speeds of wound-healing and general health-questionnaire scores at two weeks after the surgery. In this study, we examine the association between physical functioning, bodily discomfort, as well as General Health Question-naire score at three months after laparoscopic coloanal resection. We also investigate the effect of perioperative complications on health related qualityof life. Post-surgery complications are associated with poor outcome for patients who have had an elective myovalinary infarotation.

27509867,"In this paper, we describe a controlled trial in which 69 patients were assigned to one of three groups of treatment for 12 weeks. Each group received either simvastain 40mg daily or ezetimbe 10md daily. The results showed that the combined treatment had significant effects on leptomin, CRP, and other markers of systemic inflammation. This was the first study of its kind. Adipokines were also studied in this study as well. It was concluded that both statins and equitibendolbine have anti-hypercholesteroling effects."
28601888,"This paper uses a national survey to characterize public perceptions of mental illness, dangerousness, and desired distance. The results indicate that most Americans identify mental illnesses as mental conditions and that many report multicaual explanations for these circumstances. In this paper, the authors examine whether changing children's negative attitudes toward overweight and obesity will reduce their negative stereotypes"
32172237,"In this paper, we report on the association between high-Density Lipoprotein Cholesteryl Esther transfer Protein and risk of heart disease in men and women. We also examine the effect of adding cholestery ester transfer proteogen to statin therapy in patients with severe hypercholestrolemia who are not at their ideal low-dension lipophosphoprotein level. This study is designed to assess the safety andefficacy of analtrapib as an add-on to other lipid altering treatments in Japanese patients suffering from hypocholsterolaemia. It was found that anacetrapub reduced both LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol but did not improve either. The aim of this trial is to determine the effects of Anace trapibus on endometrial function, blood pressure, and inflammatory markers in subjects with high risk for cardiovascular disease."
27037567,"In this paper, we describe the results of a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of direct pulp cementation with calcium enriched cement in teeth. We conclude that blinding is necessary for rigorously designed trials because it separates the process of capping from the recruiter and allows for greater confidence in the outcome."
19307137,"A prospective, feigning pain study is performed on 50 patients who have undergone open thoscotomy. In this study, the authors investigate the effects of heat injury on pain scores and severity after surgery. They conclude that cryoanalysis combined with an IV-PDA regimen reduces pain in acute and long term post-tortomy pain. The results are similar for both groups. Long-term follow-up studies are conducted to identify predictores of chronic pain following throatectomy. After two years, all patients receive similar pain management. This study determines whether there is any difference in pain and recovery between the control group and the intervention group. It also examines the effect of timing of Epidural Analgesis on long-time outcome after thoarcotym."
23901263,"In this paper, we describe the prevalence of and treatment of ""hot flushes"" in postmenophausal women between the years of 1880 and 1992. We examine changes in bone sorption with riserate treatment for Osteopardy as a predictor of reduced fracture risk. A telephone study of 594 females from Gothenburg, Sweden, was performed to assess the frequency of hot flushing, use of Estrogen, age of Menopause Onset, and, among those subject experiencing hot flash experiences, the number of years they had experienced. The mean duration of their experience was variable throughout all groups; transdermal or oral administration of estradiola were compared against respect to the effect on lipidmetabolization. Eighty one post-menopaual woman were divided into three group: first two groups receive sequential estrogen treatment by either transderm estrayol EstraderM TTS / Ciba geigy; 24 women are randomed to either conjugated estes Premarin 'CibA GeiGy' or 0.675 mg/day ConjugatedEstrogin? Premiret,Weekend ; twenty subjects serve as control groupwithout therapy. Unlabelled We used results from Fracture intervention trial to determine the relationship change at 1 year of Alendronate Or placebo treatment and thereafter hip, non-Spine, And spine fracture risks among 6186 Postmenomepausals. In the unlabeled group greater reductions did not appear to be associated with lower risk of frailty. Furthermore, there were few studies on the relation between short- term change in biochemical markers of Bon Resorption and Non- Spine Fracle Risk among bisphosphonic-treated women. This study also included an assessment of response to three estrogen regimens in nine ethnicities of Asian women who received three doses daily. After two weeks of baseline observation,the women took one of three conjuged estrogens -- CE/ Medroxyprogessterone Acetate - dosages. Following two week of base observations,they received oneof three conjugates estrogen pills -- Cescitated equaine progesteron... BZA 20 milligrams/ce. At week 12, both Bza/CE dose showed significant improvement in easy lubrications score"
20927753,"In this study, we examine the association between bone mineral content in healthy infants and serum 25 hydroxyvind D concentrations. We find that those with low levels of vitamin D are at greater risk for developing hip fracture than women with higher levels. A double blind, random-experimenting trial is performed to determine whether either food or pill supplementation improves bone mass in girls age 10 - 12, aged 12 yr. The results show that both groups have significant effects on bone health. For example, one group has a greater effect on total body height than the other; however, there is no evidence that either group can be trusted."
31521556,"In this paper, we present a review of the evidence for the use of whole body movement, mental training, and motor imagery in elderly patients. We conclude that these forms of physical training have been used to promote motorlearning but are not yet fully validated as an effective form of therapy. This paper also discusses the reliability of studies using the Physician's Evidence-Data-base scale. It is important to note that many studies do not provide adequate evidence regarding the efficacy or safety of specific treatments."
28700715,"In this paper, the authors describe a double blind, rand-omized study of 136 children who had been assigned to either Clon alone, M. Ph alone or combined with Clonidine in addition to their usual treatment for ADHD. The results showed significant improvement for subjects assigned both groups. For primary outcome measures of ADHD, Conners abbreviated symptoms Question - Teacher, significant improvements occurred for those assigned only to Clone. Correctable weakness in the design, conduct and analysis of Biomedical and Public Health research studies can produces misleading results and wasted valuable resources. This paper is an attempt to test the efficability of two different treatment regimens for Chinese children suffering from attention-defiant hyperactivity disorder: 1) methylphoni date alone; 2) melphenidate plus psychosocial treatments that included parenttraining and counseling ; social skills training/psychotherapy & academic assistance ) or 2) combination treatment with attention control treatment. After 2 years, all patients were assigned either atomomexetine or placebo augmenting therapy. Outcomers were measured in multipledomains before and after treatment and at end point with the combined treat and medication management group continuing medication at every assessment point. Safety measures include vital signs, weight, and adverse incidents. A lack of detailed written protocols and poor reporting of trials can produce false results"
28869278,"This study focuses on the prediction of cerebral oxygen saturation in elderly patients who undergo coronary angioplasty. It is a prospective, open-label, random-experimental study to determine whether it is possible for infants with extremely preterm births to be supported by near Infrared Scangraphs and an evidence-based treatment regimen. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the predictor value of Cerebraal Regional Oximetry in the onset of postoperative Cognitive Dysplasia in older patients undergoing Coronary artery bypass surgery. A large number of studies have failed to predict this effect. Although there are many potential drawbacks that may arise from inadequate reporting of controlled trials, adequate reporting has been necessary to ensure accurate critical appraisal"
22665997,"In this paper, the authors describe a double blinded, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerable of the controlled release form of paroXetine in adult patients with ""social anxiety disorder"" according to D.S.IV criteria. The results are as follows: Paroxetine is more effective than either monoamine or benzodyzepines; however, it does not lead to widespread use. This paper also discusses several other studies that have been conducted on social anxiety disorders. For example, we report that paroxysone has shown efficacy against generalized social anxious disorder, but no evidence exists for its use in adults. We conclude that cognitive behavior therapy may be as effective as conventional group therapy when delivered in psychiatic settings. However, there is still some question about whether such an intervention will work in clinical situations."
25100025,"In this paper, Dr. Manette focuses on the use of composite resins for restoratives in patients with apciatic periodonitis. He uses an extended patient series to evaluate the performance of different types of restorations used for posterior teeth. The results are mixed: some have been replaced due to disease or injury; others have not been repaired because of reasons other than the original purpose of the restoration. This study is aimed at identifying risk factors for AP and evaluating their association with the severity of disease. It also consists of two case-control studies. First, it examines the survival of porcelain veneers after one year of treatment. After three years, the final results show that all of these cases are ""clinically excellent and acceptable."""
28275869,"In this study, we examine the effects on blood pressure and lipids in patients with chronic inflammation. We use a case-control design to assess the effect of different fatty acid sources on disease risk. The primary endpoint is death, non- fatal myo Cardiol infa Rct Ion, and stroke. A further study was performed by our group wherein we investigated the efficaciousness of flax seed oil or fish oil as an anti-inflammatory treatment for patients who had acute renal failure. This study also included comparing the results of two different diets: eatable oils rich in alpha Linoleric acid and omega-3 PUFFA. These studies were followed by another study which examined the benefits of increasing the amount of Flax'seed oil from either consuming it or eating it alone. It was found that flaXseeed Oil reduced the proinflammatory response of dialysis subjects. Thus, these studies are important because they provide information on the pathophysiology of heart disease."
28912917,"In this study, we examine the changes in plasma amphostess and basal nitric acid levels in patients with left ventricular failure who received piogltazone for 4 weeks. The mean values of amphosphosteses and abporinde were found to be similar in all groups except for the treatment group with buformine. This was followed by a further analysis of the effect of PioGlisolate on metabolic control among Type 2 diabetes patients. We conclude that it is possible that piglitatazide may have an effect on both lipid and glucose control in type 2diism."
31452084,"This paper focuses on the cost-efficacy of an intervention for patients who are hospitalized with myocardiatric infatriates. It uses a patient-centered, outcome-based framework to assess the efficability of two different approaches to smoking Cessation. The first is aimed at improving the quality of care delivered to patients during their stay in the hospital; the second is designed to improve the rate at which patients quit smoking. In this study, we examine the costs of three different types of smoking cessesation services: 1) routine care consisting of usual care and 2) telephone calls from nurses after discharge. Our results suggest that these two approaches can be more cost effective than conventional methods for treating patients with heart disease."
28720391,"In this paper, we describe the efficacious and safety of a novel molecularly targeted form of fortineinib, an anti-metasergic agent, in patients with advanced papillary cell carcinoma. We assess the potency of these two regimens in terms of progression- free survival after 6 months. The primary outcome was progressionfree survival at 6 month. This is largely due to the fact that there are multiple different types of disease associated with non-clear cell disease."
16908917,"In this paper, we examine the effects of financial incentives on physicians' practice practices and determine whether they can be used to improve patient care. We use a case-control study to assess the effect of an incentive system on immunizing children in inner-city New York City. Coverage rates for children who receive the incentive increase significantly when compared with those who do not receive it. This is followed by examining the effectiveness of two different approaches: 1) provision of ""financial incentives"" for superior physician performance and 2) availability of standardized smoking cessations treatment tools. The results of the first trial are presented in this chapter. A pilot version of our validated evidence-based smoking Cessation Score was developed and tested for reliability. Two other studies were also presented; one focused on improving physician compliance with breast exam, coloreciatal testing, and pap testing. These studies showed that payment systems may improve physician satisfaction with treatment but did not improve their efficacy. They also examined the impact of change in Medicaid payments on the location or amount of service given to patients in community setting. Physicians provided more services to clients in rural settings than in urban centers. However, there was no significant difference in the extent or frequency of these services."

28913588,"In this paper, we describe a singlecentre, singleblind placebo-controlled trial of 150 patients with prematurely ejculation who received no drugs. The efficacy was compared to that of four drugs: paroixetine, tevagonal hysteria solution, and serotonine re uptake inhibitors. We conclude that the use of these three drugs is superior to those of other agents in treating premature men with severe prematureness. Premature men are usually treated with topical penicillin or sildenanafil citrated. This study also compares the safety and efficiacy of two different anti-ejaculating drugs, one being daponoxerine and the other being sertraline. It shows that both regimens improve the latency time for prematuremen but do not lead to adverse effects."
28660673,"This paper uses a controlled trial of maternal social support to examine the reliability and validity of three different methods of collecting information in medicine and social science. The first is medical records, home visits, and 'post-eventual questions' on pregnancy topics. In this paper, we use an observational study of women who had been pregnant as well as two random surveys of mothers with their pregnant history, smoking, alcohol use, length of labour, baby sex, birth weight and neonatial health problems. We conclude that these studies suggest that mothers are more reliable sources than medical record because they do not reveal any personal information. A knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score from the Western Osteoartis Index was used for younger and older patients with knee injuries. It was developed for young and/or more vigorous patients; it has in previous trials on these groups be the more responsive instruments than the WCOMA. After total knee replacement, results were retestable and validated by Swedish version LCK 1.0. These results indicate that some patients eligible for complete knee surgery have expectations of greater dem or ing physical function than required for everyday living. Furthermore, the outcome of all knee surgeries depends on the patient's ability to selfefficacy. An advanced practice Physiotherapist, called an App, is employed in orthopraedic services to help improve access to treatment and care for patients suffering from hip or knee pain. He also compares exercise behavior and self efficacy at six weeks after consultation. His aim is to investigate whether he can deliver corticosterroid directly to patients without having to wait for surgeons. Although there is no evidence against using physiotherapist intervention when treating shoulder pain, several studies have found agreement between physcian and surgeon physicians for surgical management."
24508930,"This paper focuses on the effect of resistance training on strength and performance in people with multiplesclerosis. It uses a two-blind, randomed controlled trial to examine whether progressive resistance exercises improve muscle strength, muscle endurance, and functional function in adults who have had an acute stroke. The results suggest that exercise training can be more effective than usual care for patients after stroke because it is not limited by spontaneous recovery. In this study, we compare the effects of eight-week resistance program on walking speed, balance, motor function, spasticity, fatigue, gait, falls risk, bradykinea, leg muscles, as well as health-related qualities of life in persons with chronic stroke: 18 subjects aged 6 months to 12 years old; 17 volunteers with stroke were assigned into either control group or experimental group. A total of 24 subjects received both groups."
26503388,"The purpose of this study is to derive an improved risk score for patients with a high risk of heart disease in the United kingdom. It is based on five 11 major coronary event events, 462 168 fatal and 294 nonfatal among men and women who had at least 10 year unbroken following-up. This score was developed using the results of the Scottish Heart health extended cohort's blood pressure survey. In addition, it was used to predict the effect of different ""high-risk"" and ""population"" approaches to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases in middle aged British men. These strategies were likely to be more effective than those that involved traditional risk factors. However, they did not have sufficient efficacy to reduce major CVD in Middle-aged British people. Thus, these methods were limited. Family history information was collected in primary care as well as in laboratory studies. Physicians were able to estimate the absolute risk for 1,41 hypertensies. After 12 month follow- up, 2,681 patients were still in their study. A further study was conducted in which physicians were asked to assess their own health related behavior, risk factor, and perception about heart attack risk. They also reported their self-reported changes in body mass index, cholesterol concentration, diaspilic blood flow, smoking, exercise, alcohol consumption,and diet. Their responses were measured by health risk appraisal."
24789063,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effect of physical activity on stroke risk factors. He describes an exercise trial in which patients are assigned either to receive ""structured care program"" or usual care. The outcome is that patients who adhere to the prescribed measures at 12 months postdischarge have a reduced risk of occurrence of first stroke. This study furthermore examines the effects of lifestyle changes on blood pressure and lipoprotein levels in stroke patients. A pilot study was conducted whereby patients were given self-tiration of antihypertensives for improved blood flow control after acute stroke; however, it was found that these patients did not respond well to regular follow-up. After two weeks, they were divided into two groups: one group received nurse-led care and the other group followed up with usual treatment. Both groups showed significant improvements in their health over the course of the intervention period. Anderson concludes his paper by stating that there is still much work to be done in improving patient health through evidence-based approaches."
24863864,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed description of suicidical thinking in patients who have recently attempted suicide. They assess their performance on executive tasks and memory tasks using task-retrieval tests. The results suggest that antidepressive treatment improves both verbal and working memory functions in depressed outpatients. A recent study suggests that moclobemiemide may be more effective in treating depression than other drugs. Major depression has been frequently observed to exhibit cognitive dysfunctions, particularly in memorized tasks. Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors are increasingly used as an antipsychotic because they can reduce the severity of depression. However, there is little evidence for their efficacy in improving mental function in elderly patients suffering from major depression; however, several studies have suggested that these symptoms respond to training. These studies include comparing the effects of selective serotomin re uptake inhibitors with those of paroxentine or noradreninergic agents. Brain Snack: Cognitive Deficions are characterized by social and occupation dysfunction. This study examines the effect of neurocognitive enhancement therapy in combination with restorative treatments in older patients with major disorder. It shows that bipolar disorder is associated with severe psychological impairments but does not lead to significant changes in mood or behavior. Bipolar Disorder is often associated With Cognitive Dysfunction. Although many trials have examined the use of brain-sensing techniques in general, few have investigated the effectiveness of these specific approaches."
31009401,"In this paper, we describe a novel approach to treating nonalcoholic fat liver disease by using bifdophagous probiotics. We aim to evaluate the effect of Bifediobacterium Longum with Folicoligoscharides on blood pressure in patients with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease. This is the first large-scale study of its efficacy and safety in humans. It was performed in 58 patients aged 25-64 years old. The main outcome was change in blood vessel permeability from baseline to 8 weeks. A pilot study was carried out for 30 patients who had been treated with Lactobacilus reteniri or guar Guar gum alone. These patients were divided into four different groups: group I received 500 million Lacticillin Bularicus/ Streptocolus thermophilis per day; group II received one tablet daily; and group III received two placebo capsules each. Both groups showed significant improvement in their overall health."
27501434,"This study focuses on the effects of ""Project Support"" -- a child-centered, evidence-based intervention -- on children with conduct problems. In this case, families receive better treatment than those in control groups. The results are similar: children in the Fast Track program show greater reductions from features of psychopathism than children who do not receive such treatment. Brain Snack: Many people think that poor ability to control emotions is disadvantageous because it's difficult to predict how good an individual will be under certain circumstances. However, we know that there are some situations where personal traits can actually be beneficial. For example, one might have bad emotional regulation and then another might get better response under favorable conditions. Children with mood disorders often benefit from early childhood treatment like parent training or multifamily psycho educational psychotherapy. These studies suggest that parents should be more likely to attend to these issues when they're first starting out as children. A second study suggests that low- income families tend to engage in behavior-parent training rather than regular adult care. Another study examines effectiveness of two-year parent-child interaction therapy for young children suffering from externalizing behavior disorder. It shows that both treatments increase appropriate social behavior and improve self-control."

Based on an electronic search of six data bases, thirteen studies were found which suggested that acoustic treatment is effective; one only showing signs of positive trend, all others having significant results"
29154069,"In this paper, we describe a doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and effect of Niglise sativan extract on patients with mild hypertension. After eight weeks, blood pressure values in both groups are significantly reduced after comparing the two groups. The results suggest that Nigella Sativa extract can be used as an effective treatment for mild hypoglycemia in patients who have type 2 diabetes. This study is designed to determine whether or not it can reduce the risk of heart attack in people with Type 2 disease."
21150647,"In this double blind, randomed, placebo-control trial, infants are given either a control or study formula with Bfidobacillus parcasei. The first six mo of life is measured in terms of infectious episodes, number of infectionrequiring antibiotics and incidence of epidemics. After the initial period of protection, children receive either prebioticsupplemented 8 g./L shortchain galactoligosacides or placebo supplied for the first 6 Mo of Life. This protective effect was lasting through the intervenment period; however, after the intervention period, blind follow up continued until 2 years of age. Probiotic foods have been used to treat acute malnutritions but little has been done on the effects that they can have on intestinal health. A probiotic mixture of short-chain gallactooligusaccharidas and long- chain fructofruitoligonscharides reduces the risk of an outbreak of irritated dermatitises during the early months of childhood. Prebiotic products may be useful against acute infectious diseases because they constitute ""the predominant colonic Flora of breast fed infant's."" However, these studies do not show any significant differences between the two groups. Infants who receive both formulas at different levels of growth and tolerance are divided into three groups: control group containing Bb12 Lactobacilus rectori; pg4 group consisting of 4 ml of polydextrous feed; and PGL8 category consistling of 8 G.O.S. per day."
26358067,"In this study, we examine the effects of breast-fed infants' feces on their pH and stool composition. Thirteen newborns are exclusively breast fed while the remaining sixty are assigned to receive one of two different types of formula: a fermentable infant formula or sterile stand and ard milk. The results indicate that the FF regimen is superior to the other groups in terms of sensitivity to polioviovirus infection. To determine how much bifdobacterial strain can influence the response to pentacoquex, an antipolioviric vaccine, We set up r and Omized / placebo-controlled trials. From birth until 4 mo, infant girls were given either fermented infant cream or prebiotic infant capsules. Bifbidobacterium concentrations were measured monthly during infant stools. Antipoliotic Iga response was calculated before and after the second dose of the first vacination; thirty infant women were re-omised and 20 completed both studies"
28263370,"In this paper, we describe the results of a study in which patients with high risk of heart disease were randomized to either aspirin or statin combination therapy. The primary outcome was improved blood pressure and lipoproteincholesterol levels. Adverse effects were observed during the study. Although race, ethnicity, and region differences in cardiovascular diseases are known, many worldwide health management guidelines recommend that the use of ""the Framingham Coronary Heart Disease"" risk equation be used to guide treatment decision. This sub-analysis of the recent published CRCUIAL trial compares the treatment-relationship reductions in calculated CHD and Stroke risk among Pacific American patients using varying region-specific risks assessment models. A total number of 3,54 patients were followed and 123 were finally landized. Most patients had no evidence for theiradherence to prescribed drugs after an acute Myocardial Infa Rct Ion; however, fixed dose combination regimens have been shown to increase patient adherence and improve risk factor control. These studies aim to determine whether single pill combinations can improve fidelity to recommended medicines in patients at highrisk of cardiovascular disease. Polypil therapy has been proposed by some physicians to reduce pill burden while improving bloodpressure and cholesterol levels but there is little evidence on its efficacy or tolerability. Many trials have examined different approaches to preventing major cardiovascular events from Indians and non-Indians alike. There is only one polypill available: it contains aspidin 75mg, sim vastatin 40mG, hychlorothazide12.5mM and simpvastatine 20mL. It is intended to improve long-term drug  adherence and physician acceptability among people at elevated risk who do not take prescriptions long term."
31703073,"In this study, we report the results of an eight-week intervention for children with autistic spectrum disorder. The treatment group gains significant improvements in social communication skills from baseline to 12 months. We also describe a new peer-mediated playtime intervention that uses experiential learning to improve social competence in children who have been affected by autism. This study compares immediate and four-month outcomes among adults with or without ASD as well as two control groups: one group is assigned to the program called ""Peer-Mediated Education"" and the other is given waitlist control. These results suggest that the PEP model may be more effective than the traditional approach because it emphasizes self-reflection and engagement. However, there are still concerns about the safety of the use of such approaches in low- income countries."
16235365,"Estrogen alone or combined with a high-dose estrioles therapy in postpausal females is associated with improved memory performance. This study compares the effects of two different regimens on bone mineral density, menopause, and body composition. The first regimen prevents loss of bone at the spine while the second regimen improves blood flow to the neck. In this study, we examine the effect of an extended period of treatment with either esterified or rogent estrogens for improving sexual function after surgery. We conclude that both treatments are effective in preventing bone loss. Furthermore, they reduce the risk of heart attack by reducing the amount of steroid used."
29178166,"In this study, we examine the effect of four different root canal irrigation regimens on smearing layer removal. The first regimen uses an endovac irrigation system and the second is a passively-irregular irrigation technique. This study compares the effectiveness of three different irrigation techniques: 1) conventional needle irrigation, 2) passive ultrasenonic irrigation; and 3) combination of passive airsonicirrigation and negative pressure irrigation. We conclude that these methods are more effective in removing debris than they are in treating soft tissue."
30477509,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates the use of a 7 day wear-time accelerometer to track physical activity in older women. The results suggest that wear time measurements can be used to predict longer-term behavior and disease risk. This is important because it allows for more time to collect and analyze large amounts of information. However, there are still studies that do not yet have adequate evidence for wearing time on wrist-worn devices. Anderson suggests that using machine learning methods may be able to aid in the prediction of future health events."
17253502,"In this paper, the authors examine the pretreatment factors that are associated with attribution to attrition in a patient-controlled trial for panic disease. They find that lower household income is associated as an independent predictor of severity; greater age and higher social status are also independently related to it. The study concludes by examining the frequency of panic disorder in the Swedish population. A survey was conducted on 1000 Swedish adults who had been asked to participate in one of the WorldHealth Organization's Composite international Diagnostic Interviews. Prevalence was estimated at 2.2% among men and women but no significant differences were seen between gender. This study compares three treatment approaches: 1) exposure alone, 2) exposure associated with imipramin, and 3) cognitive therapy supplemented exposure. These studies assess whether age, years of experience, or gender affect the outcome when patients receive either treatment. More physicians experienced than those without experience are more likely to be better responders to both treatments. Panic disorder is common in general practice. Previous studies have examined the effect of new treatments over old ones. However, these studies do not provide sufficient information about the effectiveness of any particular treatment regimen. For example, many patients fail to respond to conventional treatment after several weeks of treatment due to their fear of being exposed to ""phobic situations."" Other studies suggest that certain characteristics of psychiatrists may influence the efficaciousness of different types of medicine."
24282034,"Major depression with psychological features. This paper reports on the effect of imipraminstone, a GRII-agonist, on major depression in patients with severe depressive disorder. In this study, we find that it is possible to reduce symptoms of psychotic depression by using munlessepristone as an antipsychotic. We conclude that this treatment will be more effective than placebo for both major and subtypes of depression."
29131895,"The ischemia management with Accupreil post-Bypass Graft via Enzyme trial was designed to test whether early onset of an anotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor could reduce cardiovascular events. In this study, the incidence of primary composite endpoints was: cardiovascular death, reuscituted cardiac arrest, nonfatual myocardia infa Ct Ion, Coronary Revascularization, unstable Angina or Heart failure requiring Hospitalization; documentation angina and stroke were reported. A reduction in GFR was observed after two years of treatment for patients with chronically elevated blood pressure. This paper reports on the effects of long-lived metoprololil therapy on mortality and heart failure in older adults who have sustained bloodpressure above 160mm Hg. It also describes the results of another large European open-labeled trial that examined the effect of antihypersive agents on hypertension in elderly patients without diabetes. These trials included three groups of patients: 1) diuretic/bendroflumezide 2) anangiotensol-converting enzyme blocker 3) a combination of these two drugs. The first group was divided into two groups according to their age and severity of disease. They were assigned to either strict control or moderate control. Their primary outcome was reduced by the time they reached their target values. Both groups had significant reductions in the risk of fatal or non Fatal Stroke. Although there was no difference in both groups, it was noted that the second group did not have as many complications as the first."
31680952,"A double- blinded, placebo-control trial comparing the effects of two different drugs on alcohol dependence. The first study compares the efficaciousness of a camprosate with that of another drug in treating alcohol dependent patients. In addition, the second study uses threat and neutral signals to determine whether cue reaction is greater during an attack or at rest. This study also examines whether disulfirum affects sleep disturbances. It was found that there were no significant differences in cube reactivity between threats and control conditions."
24488616,"In this study, we examine the effects of three months of a high-fruit, vegetables, and low-fat dairy diet on blood pressure in prehypertensesive children. The results show that the daily dose of either drug is superior to the routine outpatient nutrition care provided by hospitalized patients. A double- blinded, parallel- group, active-control trial compares the safety and efficacy for valsaran with amalodipine; it has been reported that there is no significant difference in the risk of adverse reactions between the two regimens. Losartans reduces blood flow in children aged 10 to 16 years who have severe hypertension. This study determines whether dark chocolate can be used as an effective treatment for children with elevatedblood pressure. Children are divided into two groups: 1) school-based intervention or 2) control groups. After seven weeks, students were assigned to receive one of four different doses of light chocolate each day. They had similar reductions in their blood pumps from baseline to follow-up. Both groups showed similar changes in BP over the course of the study period. Although both studies found that losartan was safe and effective, they did not find any evidence of increased risks of heart attack or death in these subjects."
30698254,"This paper focuses on the use of frailties as predictors of elderly patients' health. It uses a population-based sample of 2,304 older adults who were not demented at age 65 and older to examine whether there is any association between frailsty and other risk factors for disease. The study results in identifying two published, well-respected, and validated measures of ""flicltiness"" that predict poor outcomes for elderly people."
20100340,"In this paper, the effects of a daily iron-supplementation regimen on Thai children's intelligence, mathematics, and behavior are examined. Iron treatment results in improvements in mean Hbb, Ct ; transferrin Suffocation among iron deficient Anemic mothers. This study examines the relation between anemia and maternal cognition, as well as the development of infants. It is shown that aneic mothers tend to be less attentive to their infant birth weight than controls. The aim was to determine how iron status affects maternal mental health and child development. Women of pregnancy are among those who are most vulnerable toiron deficiencies and may beat high risk for changing their psychological function. Although there is some evidence that iron and zinc can be used as preventive measures against disease, no studies have been performed on women with low blood lead levels."
21735443,"This paper compares the impact of fee-for service and salary-based reimbursement on physician behavior. Physicians are reimbursed by both groups, but they see more patients for better care than salariers. The results of this study suggest that fee v fee payment is not as effective in improving physician practice behavior as it is in reducing physician visits. In contrast, physicians who receive financial incentives to improve their practices schedule more frequent visits than those who do not receive them. A blended learning approach may be an effective intervention to reduce knowledge gap between general practitioners and clusters and primary care doctors. For example, pharmacists have reported an average of 1.00 per 100 prescribers over 20 months. An older person's health risk appraisal is used as a preventive measure against communicable disease. Two financial incentive schemes are tested: one for improved patient safety and another for increased physician performance. These incentives increase the number of children immunized with diphteria, tevatus, and haemphilus influenzae Type b. Although these incentives lead to greater increases in the amount of time physicians spend visiting children, there is no significant change in compliance or satisfaction with the treatment."
18201645,"This study focuses on the effects of two brief intervention strategies on patients with mild to medium alcohol dependence. The first is an education-based program that involves self-help and motivational reinforcement, while the second is a more traditional approach in which patients receive only one type of intervention. In this paper, Anderson discusses the results of three different approaches: 1) general practitioners' ""Drams,"" 2) brief physician-and-nurse-provided counseling, and 3) brief patient-centered treatment. Anderson concludes by stating that there is no evidence that physicians can be effective in preventing alcoholism among older adults who have been drinking excessively. He furthermore suggests that doctors may be better able to use their knowledge of alcohol problems to help patients avoid relapse."
28978497,"In this paper, we report the results of a prospective long-term observational study of 101 boys who had been initially hyperactive in their childhood. They were then made blinded to group membership by the DSM III diagnoses. Over 80 percent of the population had attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity disorder. The only conditions that distinguished them significantly were conduct or substance use disorders. This is an important advance in the field of attention-refiant/hyperactivité disorder because it has been used for many years to treat children with symptoms without having to wait for multiple reports from multiple sources. Therefore, this study uses objective measures of activity and attention to determine whether treatment can be more effective than routine care. It was found that girls with ADHD were persistent at age 16 years. By age 17 years, ADHD was persist in 61 p.m.; 78 % of girls had met full diagnostic definition for DPM-IV ADHD but not with associated impairment. Thus, adulthood seems to be characterized by improved health and well being."
23229424,"This study focuses on the use of a minimally-incisioned total hiparthroplasty as an alternative to the classic approach. It compares the results of two different approaches: 1) using puffed-class or 2) using al-CLASS. In this case, patients are treated with both approaches. The primary outcome is that there is no significant difference in the length of the procedure between the two approaches; however, it does not seem to have any significant differences in pain and function after six months."
31311165,"This paper focuses on the effects of physical activity on older adults, particularly those with fall-induced injury. It uses a two year follow-up trial of 409 elderly women who received either exercise or vitamin D to assess changes in bone mineral density and physical function. The results showed that both groups had significant reductions in their levels of S-25HD. A systematic review is performed to determine whether different types of exercises are effective in preventing falls among older people. In this study, we examine the effect of behavior change approaches on health-regarding quality of life as measured by self-rated physical activities. We conclude that balance training has been shown to improve short-term performance in older patients with osteopororosis. However, it is not yet clear whether such an exercise regimen will have any beneficial effects on long- term health."
22829395,"In this study, we examine the long-term Mortality Ratias of women and men after all Osteophorosis fractures. The results indicate that there is a significant risk of death from subsequent fracture in both genders; however, it is not yet clear whether this risk is due to initial fracture or later fracture. A case manager intervention improves treatment for patients with hip fracture who are at highrisk of future fracture but do not receive adequate care. We develop an osteoprasis case management intervention designed to improve patient education and follow-up."
28658720,"In this study, the authors compared the efficaciousness of bovine-lactoferin with placebo in preventing early-onset separsis in infants. They found that BLF was more effective than either treatment alone or in combined with Lactobacterium rhamnoseus GG. The results suggest that both regimens may be useful for reducing early mortality in prematurely weighed infant girls."
25926889,"In this paper, we report on the results of a pre-operative evaluation of patients who had low levels of vitamin D during their total hiparthroplasty. We found no association between blood levels or changes in scores after surgery. Furthermore, there was not an association with any change in short term function at six weeks after Tha. Epidemological studies generally focus on one baseline biologic sample for assessment of prediagnostic biomarkers. However, it is difficult to assess reproducibility of serum 25-Hysteriamin D levels over time; only population s from European descent and other sources are available. The authors conclude that there is little evidence for reproducibility by comparison among European populations. They also note that many patients have inadequately measured 25hhD levels. These include patients with severe fractures. There are no established strategies for replenishing these levels after hip fracture surgeries. For example, the Revitalize Study has been designed to study the effects of loading doses of 1,500 IU of Vitamin D as well as the usual regimen of post-surgery care. This study uses propensity Score methods to predict whether patients will be more likely to experience serious complications after having undergone cardiac surgery than those with higher levels"
28780542,"In this study, we examine the effects of using web-based management to improve blood pressure control in patients who are poorly controlled with Type 2 Diabetes. We conclude that adding a self-monitory device to their daily routine will reduce their glycerated hemogloin levels. This study is an attempt to test whether adding ""mobile application coaching"" and patient/care manager web portals into community primary care will result in reduced glicated hamolol levels in type 2 patients. A pilot study was conducted in which all patients were assigned to either one of three treatment groups: 1) project Dulce; 2) standard care group; or 3) usual care category. All patients had uncontrolled Type 1 diabetes at baseline. The results of this trial were as follows: change in glucation HbA1,1c over 1 year treatment period; changes in patient reported diabetes symptoms, disease distress, depression, and laboratory values. Our aim is to evaluate the efficability of telemetry-enhaded glucose reduction in people with poor control of Type 2, especially those with high glycosylation level. To further our understanding of the importance of health professional reviews for improved adherence to medication, here we report on two trials designed to assess the effect of financial incentives on improving re-source utilization among patients with badly controlled Type 2. These studies include several case management approaches intended to help patients achieve better mnemonic control. For example, these studies use telephone calls to encourage patients to take more time to manage their blood glucose. Although there is little evidence regarding the effectiveness of these approaches, it is clear that they can be used effectively."
22917983,"Methyllpheni date is a widely used treatment for adults with hyperactivity disorder, but little is known of long- term efficacy. In this study, the effects of methylpharidine on adult subjects with attention deficit and hyperactivité disorder are investigated. The results suggest that there may be some benefit in longer-term treatment. A large-scale, multi-centre treatment study was conducted to assess the effect of extended-release morphine on symptoms of adult ADHD. This study showed that patients who improved on short-lived mh/eer were more likely to develop comorbity than those who did not receive any stimulant intervention."
14584022,"In this paper, we describe the effects of two different forms of calcium on bone loss: 1) a form that is divided into three groups; 2) one group receiving trace mineral content only; and 3) another group with trace minerals plus. The first group loses more bone than the second, but it does not seem to be as effective as the other two. We also examine the effect of post-menopaual bone losses in women who are assigned to either control or treatment groups. After nine months, there is significant reduction in bone mass in all groups except for the placebo group. This suggests that the dosage used by us is less effective than estrogen therapy for preventing early postmenostomaal Bone Loss."
30202163,"In this paper, the authors present a new surgical technique for treating teeth with cement. They describe how it is used to prepare and fill root canals in patients who have persistent periodontitious lesions. The results of the surgery are compared to that of other treatments. A prospective study compares the outcome of root-end repair material using mineral trioxice aggregate or super EBA as replacement material for root end fillers. This study concludes that the use of these two materials can lead to better results than conventional methods."
31374820,"This study focuses on the effect of various surface treatments on bonding of self-Adhesives to Zircon. The effects of these different surfaces are described in detail. Abrasion is used to improve the strength and stability of the discs, while airparticles can be used as a reinforcement. These studies include: 1) standard cements; 2) conventional ones; and 3) ""self-adhadesive"" cement with an added additive. Two hundred blocks of Lava frame Zirosconia were prepared according to manufacturer's instructions. After preparation, composite resin cubes were cemented onto the specimens. Bond strength tests were performed for 24 hours and 6 months after water storage."
12011847,"In this paper, we describe the results of a tooth-restoration experiment in which all teeth were restored with different types of post and core systems after an artificial mouth. The main objective was to compare the performance of each system against that of other available options for the treatment of pulpless patients. We used sixty- four caries- free human maxillaries as controls. Each group received three different post/core systems, one control group receiving only one type of core. After two weeks, the final results showed that the Composi Post system outperformed all other options."
24615862,"This study consists of a quasiexperimental long-term design that compares pre-and posttraining Biomechanical andPhysiological characteristics of wheelchair prospulsion across fresh or fatigue states. The subjects were divided into three groups, each group consisting of eight subjects. In the control group, no subjects participated; in the 50%- and 70-percent-intension group only, twenty-seven men participated. A 7-week wheelchair training program was studied on physical capacity in unable-bodied subjects with spinal Cord injury. Thirty patients were assigned to an experimented group: 10 subjects exercised seven weeks, 3 times per week at 30 percent heart rate reserve; and 15 subjects who did not attend training. This paper discusses the effect of short interval training on endurance performance in paraplicitous subjects without spinal cord injuries. It is concluded that this type of training can improve health and fitness in people with severe spinal chord injuries but does not address the specific needs of these patients."
25238582,"In this paper, we describe the relative efficacy versus safety of two different treatment approaches for children with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. We compare the short- term effects of either treatment to those of behavior therapy in children who have been initially referred to as learning centers. The results are that both drugs improve their ability to treat hyperactive and aggressive behavior. Brain Snack: ADHD is a disease that affects about one-third of all American children. It's not yet clear whether there'll ever be an effective treatment for it. For example, many studies have found that drug treatment works better than behavior or pharmacy alone. However, no new evidence has been obtained regarding the efficiacy and safetyof these two treatments. A study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of clonic acid extended-release tablet in patients with Attention-defici/hyperactivité disorder; however, none of these studies were published until now. This study examined how well the antidoxetin chloride regimen worked in subjects with Type I and Type II attention-familiarity disorders. They showed significant improvement on the ADHD-Rate-IV scale at week 5 compared with placebo. Furthermore, they reported that subjects had more tic disturbances at baseline and even more new ones after follow-up. Finally, our study looked into the association between desipramin and sudden death in other children aged 12 years or older. Our study included four cases of sudden deaths in boys younger than 14 years old. Children received Oros MPH oratomoXetine over two weeks. After three weeks, subjects stopped taking DMI or placebo under double blinded conditions. There were immediate behavioral improvements with D MI at day 3 but there were no side effects. Both drugs improved blood pressure and pulse and blood flow. Another study investigated the effect of medication management and behaviormodification therapy together in treating children suffering from attention deficit disorder and depression. These studies used mixedeffects regression to assess the persisting benefits of MedMgmt strategy over MedGt alone and in addition to being combined with psychosocial intervention. More importantly, the multimodal treatment study of ADHD revealed that the combination of multiple modality treatment and ""comb"" did not result in any additional benefit. Instead, each group consisted of parents, teachers, children, and psychiatrist"
27512972,"In this study, we investigate the effects of a neoprexlline-based anti-inflammatory agent on left ventricular dysfunction in patients with Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy. We also examine the effect of penttoxifyLline on reductions of proteinuric activity among patients without alcoholic fatty disease. This study is aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of add-in therapy for patients who have relapsed to conventional treatment."
29098982,"In this paper, Dr. Rivers focuses on the effects of an uncontrolled sideline or controlled locker room environment on balance errors in healthy college baseball players. He uses rapid number-naming to determine whether there is a relationship between concussessions and increased recovery time after injury. Athles underwent pre season baseline assessment using the King-devick test, which was originally designed for reading evaluation, as if it were able to identify witnessed episodes of concoussion from participation in matches over three months. The results indicate that conccusessions are more common than injuries caused by impact or impulse to the head; however, they can be ignored because of the pressure put on players to return to games. Concuding is one of most commonly occurring brain injuries today. Although many studies have attempted to address the epidemic of childhood sports-related accidents, little has been published about concursions in youth athletes. This study examines the effect of age, Sex, attention-destigate hyperactivity disorder, and daytime post-concused assessment on recovery following conicsion. It concludes that patients with acute symptoms may be at greater risk of delayed recovery after sport-retrieval due to their high level of activity."
25429224,"In this study, we examine the long term mortality risk of a fracture following an initial low-traumatic fracture. We compare the incidence of fractures among women and men who have experienced refractures in the previous year. The results suggest that patients with extracapar or intracapsular injuries have fewer deaths than those with no fracture after the initial fracture; however, there is little evidence for predicting long-term morbidity after femor fracture"
21911628,"This paper describes a pharmacist's approach to treating hypertension in patients who are not at risk for heart disease. It is based on an evidence-based, systematic approach that involves comanagement of physicians by primary care doctors and pharmacists rather than usual care. Physicians identify patients with high blood pressure and enroll them in lipid management programs. In this study, the authors examine the effect of community pharmacist involvement in patient management of uncontrolledhypertension. The results indicate that there is no significant difference between the two groups. A pharmacist-led program improves blood control in adults with uncontrollable hypertensies. However, it does not reduce the risk of adverse drug events or medication errors."
22748994,"In this paper, we describe a novel method for bonding orthodontic braces to teeth using self-etched primer and conventional two step etching systems. We compare the results of these two methods with that of an in-vitro laboratory test: A total of 60 patients were placed into the study. The failure rates of the brackets were determined by age and gender as well as tooth position; each system was etched and primbed according to manufacturer's instructions. Bonding times were calculated for age, gender, patient type, mode of fail, tooth location, and numberof manipulations priorto curing the paste. This is important because many journals now require reporting of cluster-retrieval trials so that readers can interpret them accurately. For example, one report reported that ""bond failure per adhesivesystem, arch,maxilla-M and ible"" showed that the first-time failure rate was 11 p.m. with Self Etchingprimer alone or with conventional anti-etchers. However, when compared to other treatments, the overall failure ratio was 13 pp. With Transbond Plus/self Etched Primer, Adhesive Bracketons were bonded on 24 patients. After 12 months, plaque index and visual rating of enamel surrounding the bracket were measured at the lumbar region. Another aim was to assess whether any characteristics of either patient or tooth had any influence upon bond success. Thirt thirty-four patients are assigned to either test or control glue. Forty-one subjects were recruited in single-centre controlled clinical trial. Twenty-five patients received upper and lower pre-AdjusteD edgewise fixed appliance therapy. Both treatment methods were performed by sterile hands. Each patient was assigned between three quadrants from the anterior and the posterior side of their mouth. They were then divided into two groups: those who required immediate fixation and those whom did not need such care. All fifty-nine patients completed the same procedure except for some patients who needed more than one set of drills. These patients also received different types of electrodes which were used during the process."
31230196,"In this paper, we describe a population-based study of 1,7549 infants from the town of Odense who have been followed up prospectively for the derivation of cow's milkprotein allergy. Once they are confirmed, they receive an appropriate diet and begin to rechallenge at age 12 months. From this cohort, 276 babies are selected for follow-up studies in order to determine the natural course by which sensitization is developed during childhood. The aim of these studies is to investigate the effects of prebiotics on gut microbeta and to examine the effect of Af-containing probiotic blend on percents of britido bacteria and Eubactericia rectale/clostridium coccides group in fences with suspected cow ""milk protein allergy"" or Cma. This study was designed to assess the benefits of an AFF-including synobic blend over percentagesof bifidiad Orioles and Ebacterium rectal/Clostricium coccoide group; it was also used as reference for primary outcomes. It was compared against control groups that received either test formula or control formula. Children were recruited according to their gender and asked to be tested for sensitivity to dairy. They were then given controls until age 8 and subjected to repeated measurements of their gastrointestinal symptoms. At age 8, 94 children were studied for asthma, rhinconjunctiveitis, and sensitsites. We investigated the potential for tolerance and risk for others occurrences in children without cow -- milk disease. To date, no other studies have examined the effectiveness of any combination of probiotins such as Lactobacilus casei CrRL431 or Bifidinobacterum lactisBb-12."
24338903,"This study focuses on the effects that physical exercise and stretching exercises have on neck pain. It is a crossover trial in which patients are assigned to either group of two groups: one group receives manual therapy twice per week and the other group performs stretch exercises 5 times weekly. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of both approaches for treating upper-extremities disorder. The first group uses rest breaks and relaxation exercises to reduce pain and fatigue while the second group includes all-round activity. Acupplications include cupping, an ancient treatment for muskuloskeletal pain, and studies using electrical stimulation as an intervention for chronic lateral Epicondylus. We investigate the effect with electrodes on pain grip strength and function in subjects with auto-immense carpal tunnel disease. After eighteen subjects were assigned into either control or placebo groups, they were treated with electric shocks. Neck pain at work was reduced by 12 months after the intervention. An interdisciplinary health program would improve sick leave and quality of life among nursing personnel."
21177660,"The aim of this study is to determine whether low levels of testosterone are associated with a risk of sudden death in older men. This study was followed by an observational follow-up period of 3.5 years. Men were divided into two groups: those with high and low testosterone levels, and those who had no elevated level. In the first group, there was no significant association between blood pressure and testosterone levels; in the second group it was not significant. Atheroscian disease was also studied in this paper. Estrogan treatment of men without prostate cancer was associated increased cardiovascular morbity and mortality. However, the role played by endogenous estrogen levels for atheroic disease in men was unknown."
19588396,"This paper focuses on the association between drug trial funding and results in published studies. It examines whether industry-funded trials are associated with treatment effects or negative events. A total pool of 553 published trials included in this study were eligible for meta-analysis. The primary outcome was severity of depression, but only one result was reported. In addition, there was an association among completeness of report and statistical significance. Milnanacipran, a new novel antidepressiveant, is compared with climpramine in patients with severe major depression. Both drugs show significant improvement in terms of tolerability and efficacy."
21929322,"This study focuses on balance ability, lower-earthquake muscle strength, fear of fall, and their relationship with older adults. The subjects were divided into two groups: control subjects who were afraid of falling or not; and those who had known risk factors to fall. In the control group, they demonstrated greater center of pressure during weight shifts in combined anteriorposterior directions than controls. A high-enough functional exercise program was used to improve balance, gaitability, upper-limb strength among older people dependent in daily living, living in residence care facilities,and with a mini-mental state examination score of 105. These subjects performed four common clinical tests for physical mobility in communitydwelling elders. Measures included Berg balance scale, self-pace and maximum gaits speed, timed up and go test, CGS/FGS measures, Intraclass Correlation coefficients, ICCs results. Predictors for future falls were based on an analysis of cutoff scores from different sets of values. Although there is some evidence that performance measures can predict changes in health and function over time, it is still unclear whether these measures will have any significant effect on mortality or quality of life."
26996098,"In this study, we examine the effect that exercise training has on patients with breast cancer. We compare two different types of exercise regimens: 1) a six month home-based program; and 2) an eight week program. The results show that both groups improve their physical function and fatigue. This study also investigates whether exercise can be used as an adjuvant therapy for patients who have been treated with multiple moles. It is shown that women who participate in regular exercise are more likely to survive than those who do not."
15877905,"Iron-deficient anemic babies receive lower mental test score than nonanemiamic infants after three months of iron treatment. The effect on attending behavior is compared among children with and without iron deficitiency. In this study, the effects of short-term iron therapy on pre-treatment mental development scores are examined. Pretreatment results in improved mental performance for both groups. A double- blinded, randomized, controlled trial is performed in Costa Rica to assess whether iron supplementation improves attendance at school. Children with or without mild iron deficiencies have higher pretreatment tests than those with no such condition. This study examines the effect that iron intervention has on measures of academic performance among poor-nourished Latin American children. After six weeks of treatment, they show significant increases in mean haemogen levels and transferrinate saturation. These results suggest that there may be a relationship between iron's status and learning ability."
24769422,"This study aims to compare the levels of vitaminD in multiple scology patients with healthy subjects and determine whether it is associated with disease activity or risk. It uses a case-control, cross-examination study among 7 million US soldiers who have received blood samples from the Department of defense. The results suggest that low levels are important because they may reduce the risk of developing multiple Sclerosis. In this study, we examine the association between 25-hydroxyvindal D concentrations and severity of disease in patients as well as their duration of illness. We conclude that there is increasing evidence for the protective effects of high-dental status but that it may also benefit the patient in the long term."
28538328,"This study uses a novel risk-response model to predict injury in female military recruits. The results indicate that women are at high risk of lower-exertion stress fractures when beginning physical training, but the actual risk is much higher than that of men who do not suffer an injury. In addition, this study suggests that poor physical fitness may lead to greater risks of injury during rigorous exercise. Furthermore, it shows that young men often have elevated risk for chronic diseases and lose of function due to their low levels of activity before entering the military. A follow-up cohort study is performed to assess the relationship between player characteristics, including height, body mass, age, experience, ethnicity, playing position, preseasonfitness, six-min run, 40-M sprint, 6 '40-m sprint/vertical jump, and injury rates in elite Australian baseball players. Athletic injuries are common throughout the civilian population; however, few studies have examined the association between these risk factors. Women are more likely to be injured during basic training than men because of their increased severity of previous injuries. To further reduce the burden of running-related injuries, physicians recommend using plantar shapes as identifiers for foot arches."
25516002,"The aim of this study is to compare the wear of a conventionally cross-linked polyethylene bearing with that of highly crosslinked Polyethylene in patients who have undergone total hip replacement. In this trial, we assess the efficacy and safety of two different types of bearings: 1) an air-cross- linked polypropylene bearing; and 2) one of three bearing surfaces: either ceramic, ceramic, or highly crossed-linkedpolyethylene. We conclude that these bearing surface options are superior to those of traditional metal bearing systems because they can be worn more rapidly than conventional bearing materials."
30576798,"Statin therapy in patients with severe coronary disease remains poorly defined. In this paper, we describe the effect of short-lived rosuvastin on serum lipoprotein concentrations, inflammation, and plaque volume in subjects with stable angiomas. The results of this study are described in detail. Aim: To evaluate whether short term atorvastapin treatment improve endotolhelial function; anti-inflammatory action; and antioxidant effects in Type 1 diabetic patients. This study is a doubleblind, factorial trial that includes 1528 patients who were treated for at least two years. It was concluded that there were 1529 patients rand omised to treatment. There were 792 women or 736 men among pooled treatments. Methods And Results We examined C-Reactive Protein, Serum Amyloid A, Stable Angina Pectoris, Interleukin 6, Ill-6, TNF Alpha, VCAM 1, and total antioxidant status. These studies showed that statin can reduce blood pressure in hypercholesteremia but that it does not increase insulin resistance. Furthermore, these studies suggest that long-term statine therapy might prevent acute coronaries in persons with high-sensitivity cell wall markers. Although statons exert plexiotropic powers, they do not have any beneficial effects on heart failure. Insulin resistance may be associated with the progressive atheroscian disease. However, their use also increases the risk of Type 2 Diabetes mellitateus. Because women's lipid levels are too low, both statmins and vitamin D seem to have some negative effects upon them. Their efficacy seems to be related to reduced proinflammatory regulation. They furthermore examine the effects of fish oil on elevated plasma glutinogen levels. Assigning simvatatiin to treat patients suffering from type 2 diabetes, our aim is to investigate the benefits of simpvastatin over diet alone as well as against other antianginal agents. Our main outcome is improved left ventricular dialysis by reduction of arterial stiffness."
23097268,"A cross-over study comparing three different diets for seven days to determine whether the energy restriction induces weight loss. The results indicate that the high-protein, low- carbohydrate diet is more effective than the other two; however, the reduction in energy expenditure is less rapid on the higher-quality diet. This study also examines the effects of an adlibitate diet on body composition, blood lipid levels, and bone turnover in overweight women. In this study, over eighteen European women were assigned to one type of diet or another: 1) ""low-Protection"" or 2) ""high-Glycemic/Index"" diet with either varying amounts of fat or protein. After six weeks, they lost about 0.5 kg but did not differ in body weight or health. Although many studies have examined the effect of lower-carbogenic foods on weight management, no evidence exists regarding their efficacy."
21684488,"In this paper, we describe a prospective study of patients with unilateral Colles' fractures who receive early mobilization after cast removal. The results of the trial show that early mobilisation does not lead to greater loss of pain or improvement in the range of motion for the wrist. A comparison is made between patients who received immediate physio therapy and those who were given no active treatment following casting. After ninety women with collepsing fracture are randomed into two different groups; one group receives conventional plaster casts and the other receive instructions in self training. Forty-three patients receive an occupational walker 3 days after their injury and they find significantly better function than before. There are few controlled trials examining non-surgical treatment of distal radius injuries. For example, there have been few studies evaluating earlymobilation as compared to conventional immobilization. However, these studies do not report any significant differences in functional outcome at three months post- fracture."
28143406,"In this study, we examine the effect of ascotbic acid on atrial fibrilation in patients preparing for elective coronary surgery. We compare the effects of two different forms of vitamin C: 1) pre-opportunity and 2) post-elective intervention. The first group receives 2 g per day before surgery, followed by 500mg twice daily after; the second group does not receive any additional treatment. This study is designed to determine whether ascorbicic acid can reduce the risk of acute myomyocardial injuries following an isolated chest artery bypass procedure. It was found that both groups had significantly different levels of blood flow during the initial period of the study. Atrial Fibrillation occurs after about 25 %to 45 %) of coronarry arteries bypass grafted patients. Post-prolonged care unit and hospital stay are vitally important, which is influencing both Introductory and Postoperative factors. A prospective, single-blind, placebo-control study was performed in nomergency caBG patients who were scheduled for adult surgical procedures. Two hundred and 9ty patients planned for adults cardiac surgery including Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting, Valere and Congenital Operations were rand and ommized into two separate groups: an intervening group, who received 2, G of Ascorbacic acid immediately before operation in the operating theater followed with 1 gram daily Orally doses for 4 days after surgery; and another group receiving equal numbers of identical pills in same shape andsize. Results showed significant differences in length of stay among the two groups"
22162279,"In this paper, we describe the results of a double blinded clinical trial in which patients received custom-made foot orthoses while receiving conventional treatment. We aim to determine whether the effect of these new devices is as good as that of traditional treatments and to establish quality control over the outcome. This study was designed to compare the efficaciousness of two different types of shoe material on pain and stiffness in patients who had rheusatoidic arthritis. The first group received rigid materials under podiatry supervision; the other received unshaped material. A total of 13 patients with recurrent RA were included in the study. To compare effects of functional foot ornaments and unformed material for plantar pressure reduction, forefool pain reduction or walking ability in subjects without foot Orthoses. These patients were divided into two groups: those treated with regular medical care and those not. They were then assigned to receive either one of the two intervention groups. When they were assigned, their pain levels significantly improved by wearing foot braces."
23867029,"The Danish Cardinaliac rehabilitation trial is a centrally ly and ommized clinical trial designed to clarify whether the hospital-based Comprehensive Cardio Rehabilitation is superior to normal care for patients who have congestive, heart failure, or high risks for ischeic heart disease. This study was followed by solitary observation of men and woman with coronary infais rctic disease at least two risk factors. After six years, the rate of reduction in the minimal size of diseased segment was reduced. A multifactorial program of riskfactor reduction was implemented in 66 factories in U.k., Belgium, Italy, Poland and Cracow; this intervention consisted mostly of health education, exercise training, dietary counsel, smoking cesations, and medication to favorably change lipoprotein profile. The main outcome was the rates of change inthe minimal diametrically affected segments. More than one million US citizens each year die of cerebral, cardinal and peripheral artery disease, collectively known as cardiovascular disease."" There are few studies on how to prevent these diseases but there are still many that do not yet exist. For example, ""The lowering of vascular atherosclaotic risk"" was an attempt to reduce the burden of such disease through lifestyle changes. In addition, it showed that physical exercise and weight loss were associated with improved blood pressure and cholesterol levels. However, no evidence has been obtained regarding the effect of diet and exercise on the progressionof coronaries disease in patients living independently."
27900447,"This paper focuses on the association between sugar-sweetened beverages and weight gain in women. It uses a prospective cohort study of 7,5521 women with no previous diagnoses of diabetes, angina, stroke, or any other cardiovascular disease in 1984. The results suggest that consumption of sugar sweetened beverages may be associated risky for coronary heart diseases. In addition, studies have suggested that excessive consumption can lead to increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. However, this is not yet known. A recent study suggests that high-fat, low-sugar diets are more likely to cause type 2 disease than lower-fructose foods."
24985387,"This paper focuses on the use of timed up and go as an outcome measure for patients who have had a stroke. It is primarily concerned with predicting whether they will be able to walk again after the stroke, but it also includes measures of balance and gait speed. The results of this study suggest that there is little evidence of fall risk in older people who are recently discharged from their acute care hospital. In addition, many studies have suggested that walking might be associated with increased risk of falls. This study compares the ability of two different tests, the Timed Down and Go test and the Swedish Postural assessment scale, to predict whether or not someone will fall after he or she has regained consciousness."
26558538,"This study aims to investigate the use of pregabaline in patients with knee pain due to an ostearthritis. It is a prospective, i.e. random, blinded trial that consists of 89 patients who have been treated with tapentadasol for moderate to severe pain. The primary end point of the study is to determine the efficacity and safety of Duloxetine as an anti-inflammatory drug when added to other drugs such as morphine or methadone."
22930416,"In this paper, we describe a pilot study of the efficaciousness of electrodeencephalography-neurostometry in children with hyperactive disorder. Fourteen patients were randomly assigned to either an EEG-Neurofedhargic group or one of two control groups. The first group consisted of thirty sessions; the second group was composed of eighteen children who had been assigned according to their DPM-IV and OMly assignments. This study is designed to test the safety of using double blinded placebo feedback controlled design and explore the initialefficacy of individuated Egb-Neureofeedback treatment in young children without ADHD. Thirties were assigned between the therapy group and the control group. Both groups consist of 30 sessions each. A single intervention was planned for both groups but it did not lead to any significant improvement in symptoms or behavior. After six months, the results were reported. Medication used declined by 62 percent after the 14 month trial, but adjusted for this do not change the outcome. ADHD Symptom Trajectory in the first three years predicted 55 percent of outcomes. Brain Snack: Attention Deficits/Hyteractivity Disorder is characterized by impairments in brain functions. There are several studies that have suggested that nerve stimulation might be effective in treating these disorders. However, many studies have failed to produce sufficient statistical power. For example, there has been some evidence that neurofeeback training can improve executive function in people with attention deficit/hyeractivity disorder as well as in insomnia. These studies include comparing sleep disturbances among adults with and without adulthood."
26000442,"The effect of a mixed-dose regimen of torasemedie, furosemido, and penicillin on 12 patients with mild or moderate essentialhypertension was studied in this study. In the first two weeks, the blood pressures were reduced significantly in the group receiving the fixed dose combination; however, after four weeks there was no significant change in their diastical bloodpressure. A further study was performed on 29 patients who had chronic heart failure. After six weeks they were given either placebo or one of the following drugs: xipromide 40mg, propranolal 80md, or tienilicit acid 25mc/day. These studies showed that these drugs did not cause any side effects. However, when used as an antihyportensive agent, they proved to be more effective than placebo."
17239674,"In this study, we examine the association between aspirin response and long- term events. We primarily focus on patients who have a high risk of recurrent heart attack after bypass surgery. Our primary aim is to determine whether or not there is any association with these events in terms of patient outcome. The results of our study suggest that aspin resistance may be associated with adverse clinical events such as stroke."
28455948,"In this paper, Wu demonstrates the use of short-messaging services as an intervention to improve physical activity behavior in patients with acute myocardiac heart disease. The aim is to determine whether repeated lifestyle changes sent via short messages can reduce the risk of stroke and death among patients who receive these reminders. This study compares the effectiveness of two different approaches: 1) a patient-centered approach that involves pharmacist-led management of medication reconciliation; and 2) one that uses voice-based communication for self-management. We conclude that it is necessary to find alternative methods of health care driven by the increasingly burdened burden of chronic illnesses. Our first trial was designed to assess the effect of prescription Interactive Voice response, talking prescriptions, and SMS reminder on improving blood pressure adherence in Type 2 diabetes patients. It was found that there were no significant differences in quality of life between the control group and the usual care treatment group. A second trial examined the effects of using telemedicine to prevent homebound heart failing in post-stroke patients from receiving daily vital signs readings over six months. These studies are important because they have not yet been published in poor countries. They also show that text message technology may be useful in reducing unintentionally non-adherence to prescribed drugs in high-risk patients such as those with severe coronary heart diseases."
31969830,"In patients with chronic claudication, a walking exercise program is superior to strength training in terms of improving performance. The results of this study are as follows: 1) the patient population has been divided into two groups: those with intermittent clamoring pain and those who do not. A total of 24 patients were assigned to either supervised walking exercises or resistance training. Both groups showed significant improvement in their ability to walk. This was followed by another study that examined the effects of single-session walking and combined activity on blood flow and resistance in peripheral arterial diseases. It was concluded that these three types of exercise could be more effective in relieving pain than walking alone."
11698781,"This study consists of two periods. Supplementation and observation. The subjects were divided into four groups, each group receiving one hundred g of dairy products. Frequence or duration of acute dirrhoa episode was examined. Lactobacterus casei-sp strain G had been shown to improve recovery from acute rotavior disease. In this study, the effects on healing were compared with those of placebo in children with severe acute diarrhea. A double blind trial was conducted in Thail to determine whether Lacticillin GG could be used as an antidisease agent for patients with mild to moderately dehydrated acute disarray. Children aged 6 to 36 months were admitted for acute tuberculosis; they received either oral rehydratation solution or placebo twice daily for two days. There was not a significant difference in clinical response between the treatment groups. When only ones with acute bloody diarring is considered, there was no significant differences overall in patient response. However, when only those who had acute nonbloody Diarrhaea were considered at all, it was significantly shorter than in the control group. Furthermore, after early administration of Licotbacillus Gulliver, results were much shorter: best weight gain, and fastest correct of acidosesis."
27914601,"The aim of this study is to determine whether an exercise regimen involving water-based and resistance training will be more effective in reducing pain and improving balance in patients with hip or knee osteoarthrits. In this paper, the authors describe the effect of two different types of exercises: 1) aquatic exercise and 2) physical education on falls risk factors in elderly adults with arthritis. Both groups showed significant improvement in both fall risk factor scores. A further study was performed to examine the effects of three different forms of exercise on leg and knee stability in older women with knee Osteoartritis. These studies were published in several journals."
25529265,"This study focuses on the effects of an eight-week exercise and walking program on patients with fagitalgia. The results suggest that these two types of exercise are effective in relieving pain and improving quality of life. In addition, there is evidence that they can be used as preventative measures against chronic back pain."
28150351,"The aim of this study is to determine whether novel risk factors, previously calculated in the Atheroscomatose Risk in Communities study, can be used to predict the development of Type 2 diabetes. In this paper, we examine the effect of a magnesium-rich diet on insulin resistance and blood pressure among patients with type 2, who are not at risk for hypermagnesemia. We also investigate the efficaciousness of an eight-week regimen of magnesium chloride or placebo in treating newly diagnosed depression by elderly subjects with Type 1, hypomagninesemia; there was no significant difference in terms of body weight or fasting blood sugar levels between individuals in either group. This study evaluates the effects of extended-request niamin added to statin therapy on reduced lipoprotein concentrations in adults with non- Insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus. Although it is unclear whether long-term use of these drugs will reduce the risk of death from heart disease, our results suggest that they may be useful as treatment for other types of disease."
28589547,"In this study, we aim to assess the effects of physical activity on patients with lung-cancer disease. We compared the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation and chest physical therapy in patients who had previously undergone a surgical procedure. The results suggest that these two treatments may be more effective than other approaches for improving patient health. A prospective observational study is performed on all patients followed lung resecting via thoscotomy over 13 months. All patients were divided into four groups: Pulmonatory Rehabilitation; Chest Physical therapy; and an outpatient-base complex intervention designed to improve physical status and prepare for the hospital journey and recovery after surgery. This trial was carried out in 24 patients from three Australian hospitals with stage III-IIIb NSCLC. Thirteen healthy individuals without malignant disease were assessed once. Outcomers included tri-aximetry accelerometery, number of stepsper day, six minute walking distance, muscle strength, question ellasis including health- related quality of life."" Postoperative plethic complications are common following Lung Resection. These complications include pneumonia and eatlectasm. Preoperative postoperativepulmonary complications can occur as well. Physicians recommend using peak exercise Vo2, which has been used for prediction of surgical risks, as an outcome measure. However, there is no single published study evaluating the efficacy of short-term exercises in preoperative lung cancer patients."
28095385,"This study aims to compare the efficaciousness of percutaneous drainage with emergency choecystentectomy in elderly patients who have acute calculous-acalculously choleccistitis. In this study, we assess the results of laparotomy and delayed chemopplication in patients with severe acute bowel disease. Although there is some evidence that early treatment may be more successful than delayed treatment, it is not yet clear whether these two approaches will work."
25358395,"The Arthritas, Diet, and Activity Proposal Trial is a single blinded clinical trial designed to determine whether weight loss or exercise are more effective than usual care for improving physical function in older overweight adults with knee pain. In this study, we examine the effects of long-term diet and exercise on changes in body composition and blood pressure. We conclude that ""long- term exercise and  diet-induced fat loss"" may be more successful than conventional treatment in treating patients with Type 2 diabetes."
21757258,"In this study, we assess the safety and tolerability of enzalutemide in patients with castrated-resistant prostatecancer after treatment. We conclude that it is safe for men to receive either orrogen primed therapy at least two years after their disease has passed. A trial of adjutant radiation therapy was performed in men with metastetic castration-refracted prostate cancer. The results suggest that early salvage therapy may be as effective as early adolescent chemotherapies. This paper also discusses the use of sipuleuscel-T, an autologged active cellular immune therapy, to reduce the risk of dying among men who have metastatic castric-responsive prostatecy. It reports that there are no studies on whether immediate or rogent deprivations can improve survival in people with nodes-positive prostatectomy. However, several studies have reported that immediate apothecary therapy does not extend survival for those with localized disease. These studies furthermore report that delayed genteel regimens of anti-rogan therapy do not improve overall survival."
26841280,"This study focuses on the effect of Lactobacterus reuri on breast milk composition. It is shown that probiotics can reduce the frequency of sensitizing and ecrochema in babies. In this study, we examine the effects of probiota on immune system responses in infants. We assess the efficacy of prebiotic treatment for atopic conditions such as rheumaemia and allergic disease. Our results show that pregnant women who have inherited an allergy receive adequate maternal and infant care until 2 years of age when they are given LacTobacillus-RhamnosusHN001 or placebo. The risk of escapism from these two treatments is reduced. A guideline has been developed to recommend the use of anti-allergic drugs in children."
30962875,"In this paper, the authors describe a series of studies designed to assess the effect of body mass-index on asthma control. They conclude by calculating the proportion of patients who would have received major asthma treatment from an outpatient survey of respiratory function. The results suggest that most people with asthma would be eligible for these trials. A post-hoc analysis is performed in order to calculate the percentage of individuals with asthma whom physicians would not have approved for their major treatments. This study was conducted at three different centers: Milan, Italy; Belmont, Massachusetts; and New York City. These studies were divided into two groups: pragmatic trials or observational studies. One group focused on ""real-world"" studies, while the other on practical trials -- which aim to inform decision makers about how best to use evidence in practice."
24652723,"The Danish Diabetes Prevention Study has shown a significant reduction in the incidence of Type 2 diabetes in adults with an impaired glucose tolerance. In this study, we examine whether lifestyle changes can be used to prevent or delay type 2 disease. We compare two groups of patients: those with high risk for developing Type 2, and those who have lost weight or gained weight. Both groups show modest changes in blood sugar values, body weight, physical activity, and fiber consumption. A group-based intervention is designed to reduce the risk of development of type 1 by half in people with prediabtes. This study also uses population-matched cohorts to assess the efficacy of individual lifestyle change as compared to community-distributed approaches. Although the Diabetes Preventation program has been successful in reducing the rate of undiagnoseded Type 1, there is still much work to be done in translating these lessons into routine health care."

26772769,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates the efficacy of a patient-centered, multi-component intervention for improving blood pressure and other measures of health in community primary medicine practices. The results suggest that it is possible to improve patients' quality of life by involving them in interdisciplinary care rather than through one-on-one visits. Anderson also discusses the use of case management as an effective treatment for Type 2 diabetes. He concludes that ""diabetes self-management"" can be improved by using telemedicine."
31182100,"This paper describes the use of a short-message service to improve physical activity in people with Ischaemic Heart Disease. It is shown that this method can be very effective in improving exercise capacity and behavior in patients who are not participating in traditional heart-rehab. In this study, we compare the effectiveness of an ""impairment-based"" nurse led self-management program with usual care for patients with atheroscy. We conclude that it is more effective when the patient's health is improved by being on top of normal care. The purpose of our study is to investigate whether an eHaven-lead  Vascular risk factor management program promoting self control ontop of usual Care is as effective as usualcare alone in preventing acute coronary disease. Our aim is twofold: 1) to assess the effect of one-on-one communication between nurses and patients; and 2) to examine the efficacy of another-to-managed person-centered approach to managing chronic heart diseases. These studies have been conducted in primary care but have not yet been published. A new form of lifestyle intervention has been proposed using telemedicine. For example, there is an attempt to train patients to take up smoking cessations or other lifestyle changes via tethering. However, these methods do not lead to improvement in quality of life or function."

It is a prospective, open-ended, controlled trial that consists of 66 patients who have been treated for primary symptoms from the affiliated hospital of Shanghai Jian University of Chinese Medicine. The main outcome measures are pain intensity, resistance index, and ratio between sytolic peak/diastol peak in uterines. Acupucture is frequently used as obstructive treatment for women with polychemia but no evidence supports its efficacy."
23543544,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to infant formula development. They are concerned that breast milk is more comforting than infants' formulas because it contains long-chain Polyunsarated fatty acids, galactoliosacchardes, and fructofruitoligosacides; they also aim to determine whether enteral prebiotics can reduce intestinal inflammation in preterm children. The results of these studies suggest that probiotic treatment may be beneficial for lower endogenously infection morbidities by reducing gut inflammation. A combination of Lactobacilus Paracasei strains and short- chain galactuooligscharides has been shown effective in preventing infections in premature infant girls. This study furthermore investigates the effect of two different types of precarious feeding on intestinal bacterial composition: 1) infant mothers receive control formula or 2) infant women receive pity-supplemed formula with either BifiDobacterium Longum LPR or Lacticillin RhamnosusLPR. After six mo of life, babies were fed either one of three formulations. Infants received either an experimental mixture of neutral gallacto/flora or lccosatherdes during the initial 6 moof life. Preventative measures include fever episodes, number of infectious diseases, length of head circumference, digestive tolerance, adverse events, which were calculated at 2 hr of age. These precautionary measures do not last beyond the intervention phase. However, there is evidence that adding premodics or prosicitive ingredients to baby formula improves intestinal health."
28220101,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a self-regarding meditation program in improving health and well-being among community adults. It was found that there was significant pre-post gain in self compassion, mindfulness, and various outcomes after eight weeks of the program. In contrast, control subjects reported greater gains in both selfcompassion and mindfulness than those who had been given waitlist treatment. A second study examined the effects of an eight-week workshop on empatheic accuracy. This study employs randomized controls and longitudinal designs to examine the effect of compassionate meditation training on brain activity. Twenty healthy subjects received functional musculoskeletal scans whilecompleting an Emathic Accuracy task. After completion of these studies, participants were significantlymore likely than control subject to have increased Scores on the Rmet and increased neural activities in the inferior Frontal girus and dorsomdial prefrontals. Fredricksons' theory of positive emotion asserts that daily experiences of good emotions compound as time passes. However, little attention has been spent to meditation practice which fosters compassion. Accordingly, the current investigation examines the influence of compassion meditation upon innate immune, neuroendoirine, or behavioral responses to psychological stress. Sixton-one healthy adult were nedized to 6 week of training in kindness meditation or participation in another health discussion control groups followed by exposed to sterile laboratory stressor. Compassion meditation provided eight weekly classes and accompanied by Booster sessions 4 weeks later. Brain Snack: Early childhood exposure to early life disturbances can lead to elevated concentrations of inflammation. Children with high levels of ELA are believed to drive elevated risk for serious medical and mental illness in their same individuals. Adolescents aged 13-16 years old from the Georgia Foster Care system were assigned to either six weeks ""CBCT"" or waiting list condition."
30788262,"This study focuses on the effects of strength training on quality of body composition, physical function, and depressed symptoms in older women. It is hypothecated that resistance training can improve health-related qualities of life as well as mental function in elderly people. In this paper, we describe an eight-week exercise program for older adults with sarcopenic disease. The results are promising; however, it is not clear whether these benefits will be immediate or long-lasting. We conclude by describing a six-month trial to evaluate the efficacy between resistance exercises and physical activity for patients with Type 2 diabetes. After two years, subjects have improved their physical functions and reduced their risk of falls."
11279717,"This paper describes a new patient management system that allows patients to report their blood glucose levels and other symptoms directly to their physicians. It also provides an incentive for doctors to practice more informed, patient-centered care. In addition, it is designed to improve physician compliance with the American Diabetes association's recommended regimen of daily check-ups and self-recorded blood pressure measurements. The results of this study suggest that improved quality of care can be obtained in practices receiving only one set of instructions but providing evidence on the efficacy or failure of both conditions. A pilot study was conducted in six inner city general practices in East London to determine whether localizedly developed guidelines regarding asthma and Type 2 diabetes dissented through practice-based education. Results showed significant improvements in recordkeeping for all seven disease variables. Furthermore, there were significant improvement in recording for most of the seven diseases. Finally, we describe the use of ""CAMP"" -- i.e., problem-founded learning -- to implement treatment-specific care guides for type 2 patients. Although other studies have found better success with these guidelines, they have not yet been compared in controlled trials in Germany. These studies are divided into three groups: 1) general practitioner care; 2) b/c shared between the General Physician and the Clinic; and 3) conventional clinic care."" Both groups perform better than either group in all outcome measures. However, neither group has any significant medical complications. Two different forms of follow- up are studied: first, general practitioners care and second, two systems of Care-Shared between them. All four groups do well in terms of improving blood sugar control. Third, however, the Quality-Affecting Routine Improvement program does not show any difference in overall patient satisfaction. Four outpatient centers serve over 200 patients with Type 2, including those with poor gycemic control from age 16 to 75 years. They receive multidisciplinary intervention delivered by nurses, psychologists, and pharmacists. At the end of each trial, patients fail to show due to frequent visits or who fails to contact their doctor when warning symptoms arise. For example, children with insulin-deficit disorder lose their nail care significantly after attending telecommunication services. Another study examines the effect of adding nurse case management to patients suffering from Type 3 diabetes. Nurse casemanagement reduces urine dipstick testing and proteinuria. An educational program for infants with pre-diabetes was published in Swedish health care in"
19588334,"This study focuses on balance ability, lower extremity muscle strength, fear of fall, and their interrelationship in older adults. The subjects are divided into three groups: control group, high-intense resistance training; progressive resistancetraining group; and home-base exercise group. In this paper, the effect is measured on gait speed, peak torque, body composition, lean mass, bone mineral content, blood pressure, sleep quality, fatigue, depression, etc. Aims To determine whether progressive resistive training would be more efficacious than walking exercise or that combination of resistance and walking exercises would improve health performance in elderly people. Methods were performed in patients with intermittent heart failure who were assigned either to a controlled walk exercise program or an educational control condition. Results showed significant reductions in Hamilton Rating Score of depression score as compared to controls. These results suggest that progressive force training may be useful for improving depressive status among older people because it can shift the center of pressure between anterior and left directions. However, these results do not seem to be related to the antidespressant effect. Strength training has also been shown to improve physical function in old people but little is known concerning its effects on neurobehaavioral function."
27631314,"This study focuses on elderly patients who have had laparoscopic open colorectory for several years and compares the costs of care and long-term outcomes. In this paper, we describe the results of an eight-year follow-up of patients with coloncancer treated by the Enhanced Recover After Surgery program. We report that fast track surgery is superior to conventional care in terms of postoperative length of stay, pain scores, recovery, and readmission. The authors present a single-centre prospective cohort of elective colectomy patients from January 2005 to December 2007. All patients were assigned to receive either ""fast track"" or ""non-fasttrack"" treatment. They also report their patient satisfaction at the end of the first three days after surgery. A rapid recovery program was introduced as well as improved wound healing."
28699541,"In this paper, we examine whether community mobilisation is more effective in preventing dengue than conventional methods. We describe the results of an evidence-based trial of community mobilization in three coastal states of Mexico and Nicaragua that demonstrate the efficacy of socialising evidence for participatory action. The approach used in the trial was called Socialization of Evidence for participationatory action, or SEPA, which means ""conscious knowledge"" precedes change in attitude and intention to change. This study also discusses the costs of the intervention as well as the importance of household water supply. Aedes are a mosquito-borne disease that causes severe public health problems in Latin American countries. Although there has been some evidence about routine temephoses in households, no published evidence exists about how they can be used as preventative strategies."
30333027,"This study focuses on the use of the health belief model to improve patient self-regard and behavior in patients with acute stroke. It is a prospective, observational study designed to assess the extent of intervention reporting in an eligible sample of studies. The results of this study indicate that progress of time is associated with improved motor strength, synergiesms, and activities for the first eight weeks after post-stroke. In addition, there is evidence that exercise training can be used to reduce blood resistance and intolerance in stroke patients. A further study examines the relative efficiacy of treadmill exercisetraining and attention-matched stretching exercises for stroke survivors. Although these studies have not yet been published, they provide important information about the effectiveness of physical activity and nutrition as preventative measures against future strokes."

27510030,"This study focuses on the effects of one-to-one education on pharmacists' practices in low- income countries. It is a short-term intervention designed to improve private pharmacy practice and reduce drug abuse. The aim of the study is to assess the extent of knowledge and practice improvement among staff working in public pharmacies regarding four conditions: acute respiratory infection, diarrhaea, sexually transmissible diseases, and non prescription requests for drugs and steroids. In this paper, we examine the effect of an evidence-based medicine approach on improving health care workers' knowledge about contraceptives as well as their ability to use them effectively. We conclude that there are few practical applications for such approaches in developing countries; however, some studies have suggested that they may be effective."
19821388,"The effect of restraining on the immune function is studied in patients with moderate disease activity. After two years, measurements of injury and quality adjusted life years are obtained. In addition, there are no changes in blood concentrations or proliferatory response. A community-based physical therapy program for people who have rheUMATOID Arthritas is used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of exercise classes over usual care. This study compares the costs of short-term exercise class as well as standard care in a patient population of 300 adults with active arthritis. Following follow-up, measures of compliance, aerobic capacity, muscle strength, functional ability, disease activities, and radiographic damage were performed. Forty-five patients were assigned either to an experimental group or omically assigned to control group. At baseline, the maximal muscles of the trunkextensor's, grip height,maximum dynamic strength and shape of force-time curvature were lower in the experimental groups. Strength training leads to remarkable increases in all Muscle groups without changesin the shape"
19076553,"In this study, we examine the effects of phosphorus-rich magnesium on glucose homeostosis in type 2 patients. We conclude that it is beneficial for both Type 2 and Type 1 patients to have a high level of magnesium in their diet. The results are quite different from those reported in other studies. For example, zinc has been shown as an effective antiplatelet agent in Type 2, but there is no evidence that its use in these patients improves blood pressure. This study also investigates the effect of alphalipoic citrate on insulin sensitivity. It was found that alpholioc acid increased erythroocyte concentrations and improved insulin respond and action. Furthermore, vitamin E reduced fasting bloodglucosine levels significantly. These results suggest that hyperglycian drugs may be useful in treating Type 2-diary disease."

In this study, we examine the effect of a moderate-intensity acute exercise program on children with ADHD. Forty young children were assigned into either an exercise group or control groups. The results showed that both groups improved their performance on tests of executive functions. This study was designed to determine whether physical activity can be used to treat hyperactive and impulsive behavior. It was found that there was no significant difference between the two groups when compared to the control group. However, the results did not show any differences between themselves."

We compare two surgical methods for treating the disease: 1) an artelon spacer and 2) four-corner ligament fusion. Both techniques result in pain relief, patient satisfaction, mobility, Dash Score, key pinch forces, and gripping strength. The outcome of both procedures is similar to that of conventional approaches. This study examines whether older adults perceive changes in their health-related life over the durationof their hospital stay. It also investigates how well older patients are able to predict their future health states. A comparison between measures of health state and self-reported quality of life can be made invalid. For example, elderly patients who have been given poor health descriptions may not be as motivated to participate in treatment as they would be if they were expecting good or bad healthstates. Furthermore, there is little empirical evidence comparing these measures with those of the American Society for the Improvement of Athletics' Disability Survey."
16720668,"In this study, we assess the effects of a three-month treatment of 13 healthy men with low to borderline low levels of serum total testosterone. The results suggest that older men may benefit from increased bone mineral density and reduced fracture risk. We also examine the efficacy of two-and-rogens therapy on muscle mass, strength, and bone quality of life in men over age 65. A comparison of the effect of transdermal and intramusculodial treatments on male hypogonal function is made. Men receive either 200mg or placebo patches every day for 12 months. Both testosterone and estrogen increase their blood levels but are not as effective as they do in women."
29900130,"In this paper, we describe a double blind, placebo- controlled factorial trial of the effects of vitD and L-Arginine on patients with pleuritic tuberculis. We conclude that these studies have not yet been performed in humans. The aim of this study is to determine whether or not vitamin D can improve immune response to tubersculosus disease. Two hundred and 50 nine patients were randomed to receive either600,000 iud of Intralmuscular vitamin da or placebo for two doses. At four, eight and 12 weeks, early secreted blood and T cellactivated 6 kda ESAT6, and Mycobacterialium tubberculouss sonicates were measured at all. This study was one of only few studies to date that examined the association between Vitamin D status and antimycobacterium immunity. A multivitamin-supplementation regimen was used as an antibaccaloses treatment in the pre Antibiotic Era. Although there are many studies reporting the efficacy of various forms of diets, evidence-based medicine has been used to establish the connection between different nutrients."
24465519,"A pilot study evaluating the acceptability of a group-based anxiety treatment for children with an autism spectrum disorder was performed. The results showed that immediate or delayed intervention was more effective than waitlist treatment in improving symptoms and severity of primary anxiety diagnoses after three months. Children with high functioning autism are at risk for developing serious anxiety, which can adversely affect functioning across school, home, and community environments. Cognitive behavior therapy is frequently used for anxiety in these children. In this study, nineteen children aged 7 to 11 years old were assigned to 16 weekly sessions of Cbt or another waiting-list condition. This trial examined the effect of psychological treatment on parents' reported symptoms of anxiety as well as the efficacy of parent-reported symptoms. Parents completed their stand and ardised autism symptoms at baseline and pretreatment/ postwaitlist and 3 month follow-up measures. After 12 weeks, CBT improved overall scores on total parent reports of autistic symptoms; Cohen's deffect size was.77. Furthermore, the most common symptoms observed by parents were "" tantrums, aggression, hyperactivity."" These studies also examined whether the Self-Report Questionnaire for Child AnXiety Related Emental Disorders-Rvised --Scared-r --was reliable enough to distinguish between patients with major depressed or anxiety disorders. Brain Snack: Many psychologists use the MultiDimension Anxiety Score for Children --SCC -- as one of their tools for measuring anxiety."
31076471,"This paper describes a method for integrating community involvement into the planning and conducting of an impending mental health trial in four countries: Thail, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Tanzania. The results of the participatory methods are used to inform decision making at each site as to how to best approach the communities involved in the trial. In addition, the process helps to develop ""an understand and ing"" of these communities so that future research can be informed by them."
28191040,"The treatment of dry skin is the use of moist creams. They are based on evidence that they help to hydrate and maintain the skin's water-content. In this study, we examine the efficacies of topical Urea in treating plantar foot xenrosis. We conclude that both products have significant improvement in the severity of the condition after two and four weeks of treatment."
27655114,"In this paper, we report the results of a study in which testosterone replacement therapy was shown to improve leg-pressing strength in elderly men with limited mobility. We also describe the effects of short term treatment on health-regarding quality of life for older men who had low and borderline low levels of serum T levels. The effect is not well understood; however, there are some studies that suggest that lower levels may have an effect upon androgen-respondent organ systems. Men with low or borderlines low serumT levels were found to be more likely to develop coronary disease than those with higher levels but no evidence suggests that they do not suffer from CHD. This study furthermore investigates the relationship between sexuality and mood in men over age 60 years old. Although it has been reported that testosterone does not increase fat-free Mass in HIV-patients, other studies have suggested that its effects on muscles and bone mineral densities are less well known. A recent study showed that testosterone could improve physical function in patients with heart failure. However, these studies did not reveal any changes in brain function. These studies investigated the role of testosterone in improving mental function among healthy elderly subjects. They concluded that ""testogene replacement"" would help reduce symptoms of hypogonademism as well as improvement in body mass."
19346937,"In this paper, we describe the results of a recent outbreak of excessively high levels of vitamin D from drinking milk that has led to question about the amount of ""vitamin D"" on the label. We conclude that there is little evidence for an association between higher levels and reduced risk of all kinds of common diseases. The aim of this study is to determine whether calcium and vitaminD are associated with reduced incident breast cancer risk. Adenomatous Polyps Recurring in the Large Bound After adjusting for intervening groups, age, gender, nonsterioidal anti-irrigation drug use, total energy consumption, and interaction of gender were also adjusted. This study was designed to assess whether greater bone mineral concentrations and 25-Hyphovin D levels could be related to lower breast disease. It was aimed at determining whether more adequate level of 25 Hhod had any effect on pancreatic carcinogenesis. Although these two nutrients seem to have antagonized effects in large bowel health, they appear to interact with each other in some ways. For example, sun exposure induces synthesis of 1,25-OHD-3-1alphahydroxylase, which produces the biologicalally active 1,75-Ohc2-D form. Thus, 25HhOd may affect panceratic function and perhaps pancolatic disease etitology."
29620793,"A double blind trial of a combination of short-term tricyclic and benzoralizepines in patients with or without panic disorder is presented. In this paper, the efficaciousness of alprasolam, imipramin, or placebo over the longer period of time is examined. The results indicate that all three groups have improved during the initial two months; however, they do not change their dosages for more than half an hour after treatment. Context: industry-sponsored drug trials tend to lead proindustries. This study examines the association between funds and conclusions in medical studies. It finds that most patients receive forms of therapy other than Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, but there is little evidence for using emotion-centered approaches to treat anxiety disorder. For example, one study suggests that cognitive behavior therapy may be more effective than medication alone because it reduces side effects. Another study reports that buspirone has shown significant antidepressing effects in mixed-blind trials of social anxious disorder as well as generalized anxiety disorders. Although both drugs are superior to placebo on various measures of severity, no significant difference among treatments was found."
23314270,"The aim of this study is to determine whether a community-based approach to improving bone mass and mineral content in premenstrual women can reduce the risk of developing an obstructive disease. In this paper, we examine four possible hypotheses concerning the effects of individual bone mineral density on Osteoporoseis risk: that women should be more likely to improve their BMD if their Bone Mass is low; that groupeducation will be most efficacious when changing behavior than by information leaflet; That groups have independent effects upon behavior and BOM; and, that those who improve physical activity or increase their calcium consumption will have fewer fractures over two years that is worse than those not altering their behavior. This study uses results from 204 healthy women aged 25, 44, and 50 years old who completed the Women's Health initiative clinical trial. They were assigned to receive 1000 milliliters of elemental calcium as ca Carbonate with 400 Iu of vitamin D daily or placebo. Fracture was ascertained at an average follow up period of 7 years."
24567582,"This paper describes a study of men aged 50-75 years with no history of heart disease or diabetes who were invited to attend an early intervention trial against Coronary Heart Disease. The results showed that the dropout problem was more severe in this group than in other groups, and it was found that patients had higher risk of death from all causes except for alcoholism and chronic diseases. Aim: To describe the frequency of cardiovascular risk factor among families screened by nurses in Britain general practice and in sub-groups with report hypertension / hypercholestererolaemia's, Diabetes and coronary chest disease. Methods Thirteen general practices in 13 towns In Engl and Wales and ScoTland and were involved as part of one r and Omized controlled trial. Twenty six generalpractices in thirteen towns in Engle and Welsh and Scotland and Scottish and been involved in t & omize control trial conducted in three town in England and idly assigned to follow either two health screenings or another 45 minute follow up consultation annually with his general practitioner. Results One or more adults from 2373 houses were rated; 1507 individuals were eligible to participate. They were divided into two groups which received 2 health screens and 1 control group which did not receive any health screen. Both groups were measured on their blood pressure, lipid levels, resting heart rates, satisfaction with life questions, psychological well being, etc. These results suggest that population-based surveillance may result in reduced population risk for certain types of convalescent heart disorder."
28265017,"Warfarin is more effective at preventing stroke than warfari, but it has several drawbacks. Edoxaran, a new antithrombin drug, is superior to war farin in terms of efficacy for patients with atrium fibrillation. In this study, we examine the relationship between weight change and body mass-index in middle-aged women and men who have experienced atrial fibrillation during their follow-up. We conclude that obesity is associated with increased risk of stroke and death."
24788950,"This study focuses on the association between inflammation markers and physical fitness in Norwegian children. In this study, we examine the effect of exercise on bone mineral content as measured by dual energy absorption and proteometry. The results indicate that physical activity is associated with improved health for adults and can be used to predict future health problems. We also investigate the relationship between physical activities and blood pressure in adulthood. Physical activity seems to have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease risk in young adults. However, there is little evidence regarding the role of physical education in improving youth's health."
31065943,"In this study, we investigate the effect of a daily high-fat diet on postprar and Ial inflammation. We conclude that consumption of fat meals induces both postprand and iary inflammation in subjects with abdominal weight. A combination of two polyphenols, reveratrol and curcumin, has been shown to reduce these effects. The results suggest that consuming rape-like doses of alcohol can be beneficial for patients with obesity."
24933494,"African American men in low social economic urban environments achieve poor rates for hypertension control. Using a more intense comprehensive education and recommendation intervention, we found that blood pressure was improved by an eight-week behavioral Feedback intervention. The results of this intervention were reduced by 1.75 % -- stand and arderror -- in intervention and 2.27 %) in usual care groups; the mean difference in mean changes was - 7.7 mm/hg. Black patients with uncontrollable bloodpressure are not particularly likely to benefit from home-based treatment because they have no access to pharmacists or nurses who can help them manage their condition. This study is designed to examine whether ""telephonic Nurse disease management"" could improve blood tension control among AfricanAmerican patients. In this study, physicians give patient-specific instructions on how to use medication as well as information about lifestyle change and diet counseling. A multi-phase trial is conducted in which primary care doctors provide advice on drug adherence and improvement of blood flow control in patients suffering from Type 2 diabetes. It is concluded that there is no significant difference between group levels of antihypertinesive medication efficacy. However, it is suggested that physician-patient interaction may be beneficial in improving blood circulation."
16151686,"This study aims to evaluate costs of anaestetic maintenance versus premedication for laparoscopic cholescyst surgery. The aim is to compare the benefits of intrathecal pethidine with Intramuscular Pethine for post-operate pain after lalaposcopic choecystenectomy. Laparcoscotic chonescia has less pain than elective open surgical procedures, but it does not lead to faster recovery. A new method of ""preemptive analsis"" has been developed in this study. In patients undergoing both electic and gasless la paroscopic approaches, there is no difference in pain intensity or severity. Post-opératorial nausea and vomiting are still being reported; however, many studies have examined the efficaciousness of different methods"
31867068,"This paper describes a systematic, rigorous review of the evidence for physical training in elderly patients with coronary chest disease. It is based on multiple studies and concludes that resistance training is superior to other forms of exercise for improving physical function in older adults who are frail or have limited mobility. Acute hip fractures frequently lead to loss of independence but there is no concluding evidence regarding the effectiveness of strength training as an intervention. The effect seems to be greater in younger people with more severe injuries than in those with less severe ones."
25917824,"The purpose of this paper is to determine overall retest, inter-raters, and cross-examination reliability of posture measures among persons with Idiapthic scolosis. Seventy patients aged between 10 years and 20 years were recruited from an illustrious tertiary paediatric center. Outpatient assessment was performed in the period 1932 to 1948. A prospective natural history study was carried out at a Midwestern university withoutpatient evaluation of patient who presented between 1832 and 1948"
28328940,"This paper focuses on the impact of cash transfers in Mexico on maternal health. The program provides cash loans to low- and middle-class families, conditional upon receiving nutrition supplements and medical care. It also examines whether there is a relationship between the use of an out-of-povertee pregnancy voucher program and the odds that women receive facility-based birthing services in two informal settlements. In addition, it shows that pregnant women who receive these services are more likely to have access to skilled midwives as well as to receive better health education."
16477438,"The effect of rostroglitazion on insulinsensitivity and blood-pressure in patients with Type 2 diabetes is described. In this study, we compare the effects that rosilizitazone has on both fasting and post-prandial glucose levels in type 2 patients. After two weeks of treatment, subjects receive a escorted euglocemic clamp to assess their sensitivity to insulin. Insulin signaling is improved by metformin but not by placebo. This study determines whether the effect or the lack of it on glucose disposal may be related to altered insulin signals. A double blinded crossover study was performed in which nine overweight patients were randomized to either pioglataz or met formin for 12 weeks. Both showed significant reductions in faster blood glucose and increased glyceric response to mixed meals. These results suggest that piroglavize may improve glucosal uptake as well as improving insulin sensitivity."
22907552,"This is a prospective, single-centre study of the association between blood pressure and the National Cholsterol Education Program's cholesterol categories. The results suggest that this approach can be used to predict risk for heart disease in high-risk patients. A total of 389 men and 2 27 women developed coronary heart diseases during follow-up. These patients were divided according to their age, smoking, JNCV bloodpressure category, and NEP total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol categorizes. In addition, they predicted an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes among those with multiple risk factors."
23461747,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effect of crown-longening surgery on periodontal health. Although there is some agreement as to how much tooth structure needs to be replaced, there are no studies that directly relate to the amount of material needed for restorative treatment. The aim was to determine the extent of the posterior margin in patients who had been treated with metal crowns. This study was a prospective, open-lipped study designed to assess the effects of surgical crown lengtheneding on gingial health and to compare the results of different methods."
20585256,"In this study, we examine the association of st-and-ard symptoms with risk of fractures and falls in elderly women. We use a population-based cohort to assess the frequency of falls among older people. The results indicate that there are strong associations between poor functional abilities and non-environmental first falls. Age-related changes in vision and balance are also associated with frequent falls; however, anemia is more likely to cause recurrent incidents than falls caused by home hazards. This study uses telegrams to track fall rates for older adults who have fallen at least one time during the past year. A fall risk model is developed to predict future falls as well as to identify individuals at higher risk for falling."
30830664,"In this paper, we describe a prospective observational study of preterm children. Preterm infants are divided into two groups: light-dark conditions and dark-light conditions. The first group is composed of prematurely born children who have been treated for sleep disordered breathing; the second groupconsists of ex-prematurous children with no history of sleep disorders. We examine the effects of night-time noise on sleep behavior in premalignant premaculities. Our aim is to determine whether cycled lights affect sleep architecture or breathing during sleep. This study involves evaluating changes in sleeping behavior at different stages of gestation. At 5 and 11 week old, babies were assigned to either dim lighting or bright lights. A total of 30 preterminous infant girls were randomly assigned between Clamping Lights or Dim Lighting. They were given an equal amount of time to sleep as well as to cry and fussing when they were awake. After three weeks, all prettiness was corrected. Children were asked about their health and sleep habits. Their responses were measured by questionnaires and actigraphies. These results were used to predict the severity of SDB. As part of this study, physicians performed overnight in-house cardiorespriatory recordings of Airflow, Respiratory effort, Oscillation, and Electrocardiography. Sleep disturbances were identified by respiration disturbance indiceses commonly applied in medical practice. To report upon the prevalence of early birth in consecutive sequences of children treated from S/SD, the dimensions specific to theirmanagement and variables predictiveof disease severity."
25411286,"This study focuses on the efficaciousness of orally-administered saccharomyce boulardisii against nystain in preventing fungal colonizing and invasive infection in very lowbirth-weight premature infants. In this study, we examine whether Lactobacilus casei can prevent the onset of Necrotic Enterocolitis by the Bell's Modified Criteria for Early-Onset Sepsis. The results of this trial suggest that probiotic administration may reduce the risk from nosocomicial infections in early-onset prematurities. A doubleblind, placebo-control trial was conducted to determine whether Bifbidobacterium Lactis reducell the incidence of nosocolial diseases in preterminated infant babies. We studied 183 preterm infant girls who were assigned to either receive milk feedings with B.lacTis or received nothing added. After two months, they were divided into four groups: one group received daily proculture; another group had no proculturation. Both groups developed necrotizing disease at the end of the first week of life. They did not have any differences during hospitalization except for the type of food received. Probiotic treatment reduced the severity of enterocololitis in both groups. However, there was no difference in the length of time between the two groups after birth. Furthermore, blood cultures obtained from patients that develop sepses do not reveal LacTobacillus growth. Babies born before 32 weeks are given a mixture composed of four bfido bacteria, Streptostococcous thermophilus, and Lactopicillin rhamnoses HA-113 as well as maltodexrin. These studies investigated the effect of probiota on improving intestinal motility in highly low-birthhood infant children."

The aim of the study is to assess the long-lived survival of these new devices when compared with conventional anestry-free stems. This trial will be carried out in four European centers and will follow up for 15 years after the initial implant has been placed."
26838086,"Menopause is a common complication for women and there are many different approaches to treating it. Some of the most effective treatments include topical or sublingual progestin replacement therapy, which has been shown to be safe and efficacious in some trials. However, other forms of treatment have not been studied. Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy: A prospective, observational study of over 1,000 postmenopalausal women aged 18-years found no evidence of improved quality of life after treatment with this new form of therapy. Women who received these regimens reported their symptoms as absent, mild, moderate, or severe during their follow-up period. Hot flashed pains are frequent among postmanopausals and estrogen replacer therapy is considered the best treatment for them. Estradiol may also be an effective alternative to conventional medicine since it reduces the severity of menopardy."

This is based on an eight-week program of walking and bicycling to improve their quality of life. The primary outcome was improvement in walking distance by six months. We also examine whether Type 1 Type 2, or Type 3 Type 4 Type 5 Type 6 Type 7 Type 8 Type 9 Type 10 Type 11 Type 12 Type 13 Type 14 Type 15 Type 16 Type 17 Type 18 Type 19 Type 20 Type 21 Type 22 Type 23 Type 26 Type 27 Type 28 Type 29 Type 30 Type 31 Type 32 Type 33 Type 36 Type 37 Type 38 Type 39 Type 40 Type 42 Type 43 Type 44 Type 45 Type 46 Type 47 Type 48 Type 50 Type 53 Type 52 Type 51 Type 56 Type 60 Type 61 Type 70 Type 80 Types 62 Type 75 Type82 Type I Typeen/Type 63 Type 65 Type 72 Type73 Type West"
30880409,"The effects of fiber on hunger are compared in a weight-loss club. After two weeks, the subjects consume only one sachest of bran or Ispaghusulagranulate after breakfast. In this study, we examine the effect of adding fiber to diet on blood sugar and body weight. We find no significant differences between the control group and those who receive psylliium as an addition to their diet. This study is designed to determine whether water-soluble fibers can be used to lower blood cholesterol levels in patients with moderately hypercholestemia. It was found that phosphorus could reduce LDL by up to 33% when paired with psyllilia. Furthermore, it has been reported that plantago oatbran may improve blood pressure and fat concentration in people with Type II diabetes."
31866721,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates the efficacy of using a combination of h and k-files to prepare root canals in primary teeth. The results suggest that these devices are superior to conventional methods for cleaning and shaping. This is significant because they can be used with greater force than traditional instruments."
28860416,"In this study, we compared the effect of combination treatment with parathyroid-hormones on bone mineral dentition and bone turnover. We conclude that combination therapy may be more effective than either agent alone in reducing bone loss. Postmenopalausal women were randomed to receive placebo, estrogen only, or one regimen of three estrogen plus prosgestin regimens. Histology was collected at baseline; annual, unscheduled visits by biopsy; curettage; or hypsterectomy. The primary outcomes were spinal quantitative calculated tomography Bone mineral Dentity Change over 1 year With additional outcomes of double-energy x-ray absorption technique. Results in all women completingthe study who had initial bone denities were normal. Progesteron is effective for hot flushings/night sleeps but its effects are unknown. This study compares progestesterone's effects on blood pressure, weight, and endotriumal function as well as those of a placebo. It showed that mestrual cycle disturbed women lost their bone minerals after two months of treatment. Teripartide increases bone formation, increases breast cell proliferation, decreases thromboses, improves heart health, reduces risk of sudden death, long QT syndrome, has neuroregenerate brain effects, does not increase chest tumors, causes vaginal pain, prevents sudden deaths, protects against falls, induces wound healing, provides acceptable bleeding andlipid profiles, affords endogenal protection"
15231618,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of using St. John's weed as an over-the-counter contraceptive in women with ovarian activity, bleeding, and a rapid response to treatment. He concludes by comparing the pharmacollection of eighteen females treated with two different regimens of low-dose propofol or three-ketodesostrel to that of twelve healthy female subjects who received only one control regimen. The results showed that the number of breakthrough bleeding episodes was significantly reduced when the dose of both drugs was divided evenly. Although many other drugs are involved in the regulation of cytokine P450, including warfarin, it is not known whether these agents can be used alone or together."
17209826,"This study focuses on the effect of calcium-hyxide paste on dentin acid concentrations in teeth. The aim is to compare the effects of two different methods, one using paper points and another using Llentulo spiral, on tooth pH at different site. In this study, all teeth were sterilized with calcium hydrogenXide before they were placed in the root canal. After half of the samples were cut into slices and then split longitudinally, each half was rinsed by distilled water. Apical Periodontitis patients were assigned treatment types according to their severity. Forty eight teeth had apciatic periodonotic lesions. Thirteen patients received either single visit or two visits without any other treatments. All treated teeth showed improved periapidity after 52 weeks."
19789953,"Postpartum depression and anxiety are largely confined to the first two weeks of pregnancy, but there is a significant decrease in both anxieties and depression during this period. The infant temperrament question is used to assess maternal anxiety and depressed moods in children through the age of 6 months. This study focuses on parents' psychological and physical characteristics as they relate to their child's health at the time of birth. It finds that mothers with high trait anxiety tend to be more physically and emotionally healthy than those with low or moderate anxiety."
32108309,"In this study, the safety and effectiveness of a new form of statin in high-risk patients with hypercholestrolemia is established. The first trial compares alirocUMab to placebo in patients who have very high blood levels of low density lipodyprotein cholesterol. A second trial uses ezetamibe as an add-on treatment for patients at high heart risk. This third trial evaluates the efficaciousness of adding evolostumabus to statine therapy in Japanese adults with moderately elevated LDL/C levels. It was found that despite maximal tolerated Statins, many patients still have elevated Low Densit Lipoprotein Choc content. These patients include those with extremely high cardiovascular risk, such as HefH or non-hefh; they are not treated well in these studies because of their poor control over Lipid-Locrifice concentrations. Although there are other lipid reduction strategies available, it is important to know whether any of them can be used to lower LD-C level in healthy subjects. For example, if acetimibe does not work, then another strategy may be more effective. Another study shows that using bocociumzumabu plus atorvarstatin reduces both total and sub-fractional amounts of reduced low-delcontent lipophospholipids in Type 2 diabetes patients."
20470443,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the quality of controlled trials published in the top-ranking general medical journals. He compares two approaches to total hip replacement: a posterior approach with ard and st incisions and an all-in-one approach using acetabules. Anderson concludes by comparing the results of both approaches for patients with primary hip osteoarthritis. Although there is no consensus on which surgical approach is best, it is believed that minimally idling can lead to better results."
27479272,"In this paper, we describe the results of an eight-week postmenopalausal women's trial involving four different treatments: 1) dlnorestrel with a single dose of 0.075mg/day; 2) estradiola-17 beta alone; 3) combination therapy; and 4) placebo control. We conclude that there is significant efficacy for both regimens in terms of severe hot flushing. The main reason for starting hormonal therapy is to improve menopause severity and quality of life. This study compares the effects of progestesterone gel on exerciseinduced myocaral ischation in postpausalsal females with coronary disease or previous heart attack. Estrogen treatment has been shown effective in relieving symptoms in Caucaians but not in Chinese women. A recent clinical trial has led physicians to reconsider using hormone therapy. Transdermal patches are used as vasomotion relief devices in patients suffering from moderate to severe menstrual symptoms. Two studies have examined the safety and effectiveness of two transderel patches delivering 25 microgram per day E2, D-25 vs 2 mg per daily B. They also report changes in blood pressure, weight, and Papanicolaloo cytology. These studies suggest that pulsed estrogen replacement therapy may be more effective than other forms of anti-cancer therapy because it does not involve any risk of side effects."
32187830,"The effects of a diet high in refined grain foods on bilary and colonosal acid have not been investigated. In this paper, we examine the effect of two different diets on basal and ion-hormone levels after gastric restrictive surgery. We aim to determine whether these changes are related to weight loss. Bariatic surgery is the best treatment for obesity because of its ability to alter the gut flora and improve blood lipid composition. This study also uses mice to investigate the role of intestinal microbial activity during weight reduction. It was found that patients with bariaric surgery experienced greater amounts of stomach peptides than controls. Furthermore, it was reported that laparoscopic ryboplasty had an effect on both body mass and lipoprotein concentrations. These results suggest that there may be some relationship between the amount of abdominal fatty acids consumed by the patient and the extent of fat loss caused by surgical intervention."
28985287,"In this study, we examine the effects of a gastric embolation on weight loss in overly active patients. We find that all but two patients lose significant weight after the procedure and that both groups show significant reductions in blood pressure. Type 2 diabetes is particularly common in the U.S. Although some risk factors for type 2 disease are known, it is unknown whether these benefits will persist over time."
12500920,"Four and one-half years after the trial, 86 percent of the patients have died. In addition, there is no difference in patient survival rate between treatment groups. Two hundred forty-two patients were prospecteively stratified by stage following ; but despite the type of surgery procedure, they were divided according to their tumor resectionability. The first group received 2000 radium in eight fractions over five days with intravenously 5 fluoroouracil 5 F. U.. This group was divided into three divisions: control group a, which received conventional surgical treatment; treatment group that received anti-cancer drugs; and second group who received either immunochemotherapies or BCG. After two years, only 78 patients had died from gastric cancer. A further study showed that combination chemotherapy could be more effective than standard adjuvant regimens for patients with advanced disease. Although this method has not been used in many cases, it has been reported that some patients may benefit from combined therapy. For example, several patients are treated with 5-FU as an agent for curative abdomination. Another study suggests that use of basal cell wall perfusion can improve survival of gastricians."
26322509,"In this paper, we examine the relationship between levels of 25 hydroxyvitaminD in children with mild to moderate persistent asthma. We find that patients with higher levels have a lower risk of acute respiratory infections and that treatment with high-doses of vitamin D may reduce these risks. A recent study suggests that daily consumption of milk with 300 iug/day of low-denominous form of Vitamin D might be associated with reduced risk for asthma exaggerations. This study also uses cluster-randomenting to assess the association between blood levels as well as severity of asthma disease. The results suggest that adequate levels are necessary for preventing severe asthma attacks. Furthermore, studies indicate that concentrations greater than 200 hcm increase the chance of developing asthma epidemics."
24704678,"In this paper, Dr. Barlow focuses on the use of evidence-based prognostic methods to predict future events in patients with back pain. He uses a controlled trial to compare the effect of brief physio therapy with ""' usual"" treatment for neck pain and to evaluate the effects of patients' preferences on outcomes. This study is an attempt to develop new treatments for patients who have chronic neck or shoulder pain that persist beyond three months. The aim of this study was to determine whether relapses were more likely after adjusting patient's expectations about their condition by using telephone surveys as controls. A second study examines the efficaciousness of hypnosis in relieving neck symptoms following motor vehicle crashes. It found no significant differences between the control group and the intervention group in terms of pain- relatedness to stress. Neck pain has become increasingly common and multiple treatments have been advocateed in its care. There are also studies looking into the effectiveness of physical exercise in treating neck injuries."
30168261,"A prospective cohort study is designed to predict the outcome of patients with whiplash-related injuries in a hospital setting. The results of this pilot study are as follows: 1) there was no improvement in self-reporting after 6 months; 2) the prediction instrument had little reproducibility when used in an insurance group setting; and 3) the patient population consisted of only men who had been treated by junior doctors or more experienced physicians. In addition, the predicted outcome was not reliable for patients from an accident company setting because of the low reproducability of these predictions. This paper also discusses the use of neck pain as presenting symptoms in the emergencyroom. Back pain remains one of many common complaints that affect the general public. One model which has not been tried is stratification according to the prognosesis of high risk or low severity. We compare the effectiveness of standardized primary care with nonstratified best practice. For example, we have found that back pain can be reduced by multidisciplinary intervention. Musculonoskeletal injuries such as neck injury are very common in acute trauma. There are several articles in English about the assessment and treatment of various musculotic injuries. These articles include studies on the effects of anti-inflammatory drug therapy on Neck pain and associated disordered conditions. Anti-Inflammatory drugs were used for the managementof neck painful and related disorders including NAD, whiplashes-associated disorders, and nonspecific low back discomfort with or without concomitancy."
30322268,"This study focuses on the effects of a four-week personal activity monitor program on patients with angina. Twenty-two people and 11 women, 27 years old, were assigned to either intervention or control groups. Aim: To reduce sedential behavior and increase physically activity levels in everyday living for ssedentary adult subjects; Methods and results - fifty-one men and eleven women rand and ommized to one intervention/control group n = 18. Background -- exercise training is effective treatment for atrial fibrilation. However, high intensity endurance exercise is also associated with increased risk of myo Cardiol Infa ring ion. The effect of this exercise regimen on time in Atrial Fibrillation, symptoms, cardiovascular health, andquality of life in patients who are not treated by conventional therapy was studied. Post-MI patients had been divided into two groups according to their severity of disease. They received home-based care that included physical activity tracking, motivational material delivery, weekly mentor consultations as well as weekly mentoring consults. Heart failure patients were discharged from hospitals with higher readmission rates. Self-Management was known to improve patient adherence to prescribed routines but it was not widely used in the rural population. Telerehabilitation was introduced as an alternative to conventional heart rehabilitation. It was found that there was no evidence of improved quality of Life after an acute chest injury. Therefore, we performed another controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of cardiac self-repair using pedometers during cardiac patients' stay at the hospital. We concluded that these devices could be used as additional treatments for patients suffering from chronic illness."
30634478,"The aim of this study is to investigate whether guar- gum, a fiber that relieves the symptoms of pregnancy, can be used as an effective treatment for pruritous and cholesterolemia in pregnant women. Forty eight pregnant females were treated with guiar gum before delivery and after four weeks they were measured at least two weeks after treatment. They showed no change in their blood bile levels or changes in other measures of lipid composition. A comparison was made between the rate of absorption of deuteium into free cholesterol and the ratio of free lipoprotein content to plasma cholesterol precursors. This study compares six diets over five weeks. In addition, it determines whether there are any significant association between basal concentrations of fat and elevated levels of sitosterrol. These results suggest that pitavastatine may have some beneficial effect on patients with hypercholestrelemia. Because of hypoglycia and hyperininemia, patients have higher cholesterol uptake and lower appetite than do non-alcoholic subjects. To address these paradoxes, we examined baseline risk factors, phytosteroll intake, and plasma Noncholesterol Sterol Levels in participants of one case control study within the European Potential i v ve investigation into Cancer and Nutrients nested Within the Spanish cohort who develop CHD; n = 24 ; and matches controls : N= 584. Hetological evaluation of liver biopsy taken during the Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass Study was performed. Gallstone disease has been associated by low levelsof plant stelors."" Thus, the present study attempts to examine whether gallstone diseases may cause defects in hepatic cholesterol metabolism.

Furthermore, several studies have shown positive effects of statin therapy on cholesterol morphosis. However, none of these studies show any difference in outcome when compared to ezetamibe's 10mg daily dose."
15229625,"A randomized, double- blinded, placebo-control study of men with a mild to severe Erectile Dystomy was performed. The patients were divided into three groups: organic, psychogenic, or mixed; mild and moderate severity; and four older age groups -- younger than 45, 45 to55, 56 to65, and older over 65 years -- were included. In this study, the safety and efficacy for vardenalfil were compared against those of placebo in men who had an erectil dysfunction. After 12 weeks, there was no significant improvement in vaginal perchation or intercourse success when comparing the results of treatment with placebo. Vardenanafil, another novel drug, was studied in its initial large-scale home trial. It was found that it improved vaginal penetration and maintenance of eryection in patients with mildly to severely ED. Sildennaf, Virdenaphil, is also being investigated in these patients. He has been shown to improve penile stiffness by increasing the duration of the penitent period from 24.4 min to 37.2 min. When he is given single doses of 10, 20 and 50mg virdenalifil leads to rapid increases in the concentration of both venom and phosphodiestase at the tip"
25182102,"This paper describes the results of an oblique gastric bypass procedure, Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass, in patients with morbid obesity. The outcome is similar to that of other bariatic procedures, such as laparoscopic adjusted gastric b and/ing and open upright bibarrels. In this study, we compare the long- term outcomes of two different types of surgery for patients who have been severely obese for several years. We conclude that these are the most promising treatment options for those with severe weight loss."
22353603,"This study evaluates the 5-year performance of an enamel bevel placed and dentine lightly ground in a lesions. The teeth are restored with either single bond or clearfil Linerbond II, which are self-etched by one dentist. All restoration materials are placed by two dentists. In this study, patients receive both types of restorative for their necks; they are divided according to their severity. A new restreative called ""giomer composite"" has been introduced. It is used in Class V cervical lessions that are not altered by rotary instruments. These studies assess retention, color match, marginal adaptation, anatomic forms, cavo surface margin discolorations, pre-and post-oppressive sensitivity, surface texture, and fracture at attachment. Two years of follow-up was performed using modified United States Phss evaluation criteria. There were high percentages of Charlie scores for marginal adaptation and marginal discolouration in groups 2, 3, and 4 but all groups have  5 percent Charlie Scores at 6 month and 10 % Charley scores at 18months for retention"
11580867,"This paper presents the results of a prospective, observational study of patients with ototic effusion who had been treated with either an ostolitic or no surgical intervention. It shows that although there is little evidence for the effusiveness of treatment in these patients, it does show that some minor chance may be involved. The main cause of this variability in patients' response to treatment is that they are attracted to the ""r and Om chance"" of trial outcome. In addition, studies using small sample size have not consistently found significant effects on patient outcome; therefore, physicians must carefully examine their patients before making informed decisions about whether or not to treat them."
22161405,"This paper focuses on the association between drug trial funding and outcome results in medical literature. It is reported that industry-funded studies tend to draw professional conclusions about treatment effects or side effects. In this case, mirtzapine appears to be more effective than paroxentine in treating major depressive disorders. A doubleblind, parallel- group study compares sertraline's efficacy with that of a standard serotonine re uptake inhibitor in patients with Major Depressive disorder. The primary endpoint was improved by the Hamilton Depression Score for depression. Both drugs showed significant improvements from baseline at week 1 and thereafter. Although there were no significant differences between these two groups, they did show significant improvement over the first eight weeks of treatment."
26081915,"In this paper, we describe the effects of gastric bypass on type 2 diabetes patients. We compared the effect of surgery on both blood lipids and total cholesterol in obese patients who had recently been treated with apnotism. The results suggest that weight loss may be more effective than usual treatment for Type 2 disease. This study is an attempt to determine whether bariatic surgery can be used to treat patients with hypercholestrolemia. It has been reported that it can reduce the risk of complications by using bile-acid salts as scaffolding. Furthermore, our work suggests that increased glucago-like phosphorylated peptide 1, GLP-1, might also be involved in the regulation of insulin release after surgically inserted ileum."
21053026,"The results of this study suggest that a grade-d activity intervention is more effective than usual care for patients with low back discomfort on return to the work site. In addition, there are significant differences in number of sick days due to lowback pain over time. A novel approach to motivational counseling by trained nurses is described. Over ten years, both menand women who have sought treatment for low Back Pain report improved health and reduced pain. This paper also discusses the use of the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs model as an evidence-based intervention for older patients suffering from chronic Low Back pain"
30287245,"In this paper, we examine the underlying nervous systems that are responsible for visual search in a cluttered environment. We find that an early interaction between the two is important because it helps to predict what needs further attention. Brain Snack: ASD is one of the most frequently misunderstood and underappreciated forms of autism. It's believed that people with high-functionality can't understand language well enough to learn how to communicate effectively. This paper investigates the ability of young children with low-functioning autistics to recognize when they hear words correctly. The results suggest that there may be some kind of delay in learning these skills later in life."
28376055,"In this study, we examine whether infants who receive a higher daily dose of vitamin D have better bone health at three years of age than those who do not. This is important because it provides important evidence to inform public health recommendations about how best to care for children with low-dosed or inadequately resuscitated bone. The authors conclude that breastfed babies should be given 200 iu/day of the recommended amount ofvitamin D as an early-life preventative measure against ricketting. They also report that in addition to improving bone mineralization, they found no relationship between blood concentration and body composition at two years old."
25793643,"In this paper, we describe a national, multi-centre, cluster-random and ommized controlled trial to assess the efficiacy of an integrated care program for stroke patients. The primary outcome was the ratio of patients who followed recommended measures at 12 month postdischarge. This study is based on adherence to medication and patient health behavior. Aims To evaluate the effect of tailoring stroke knowledge and providing reinforcement opportunity are two strategies suggested to improve the effectiveness of Education. These include community-based participation in research to prevent recurrence among all inner-city strokes through education ; Pedringane's partnership with Harlem/Bronx community reps, stroke survivors, research er, physicians & outreach workers and nurse-care trained nurses and physician-assistance workers used Community-Based Participatory Research to conceives and develop the Prior Prevent Return from All Inner-City Strokes Through Education -- PRAISE -- trials were conducted over three years after their initial intervention. We conclude that ""Enhanced secondary prevention"" has been shown to be more effective in preventing new vascular event in patients with mild or no acute stroke than conventional stroke secondary treatment. Our aim is to determine whether comprehensive post discharge care management forstroke survivors is superior as organized acute heart department care without enhanced discharge planningin improving sensitivity to health and well being."
24346781,"This study compares the effects of General or Regional Anesthesia on mental function in older patients. Sixtiful patients were assigned to receive both general and regional aesthesia. The results showed that there were not any changes in mental performance after 3 months, but there was no significant change in other measures. In elderly patients, general anesthesia is superior to spinal anestry for knee replacement. Both methods are used for treating fractured necks. A total hip or knee-replacement surgery is performed with either epidal analysis or general ascent. There is little difference in blood loss during the operation; however, some patients die within four weeks of surgery."
27859327,"In this paper, we examine the effects of a cash transfer program on early marriage and pregnancy among orphans and vulnerable children in Malawi. We find that the program reduces the likelihood of getting married by five percent but does not lead to early birth. Furthermore, there is no evidence that it improves child health."
21890437,"This paper focuses on the effects of cow's milk on height growth in girls. In this study, we investigate the association between dairy-based diets and height gain in premenarchals aged 9 and 11 years. The results indicate that children who receive free milk from their families grow more rapidly than those who are not provided with it. A two-year milk experiment is carried out in China to determine whether consumption of milk with or without cholecaliferol can lead to changes in height, weight, and body mineral content. We conclude that these changes are likely due to increased levels of bone mineral concentration within the female body."
28034901,"This paper focuses on the effect of body mass-index on long-term outcome after initial percutaneous translucl Coronary angiooplasty or coronary bypass  Graft surgery. The results of this study suggest that patients with high BMI have better outcomes than those with lower Bmi, but there is no concluding evidence for this association."
32176779,"In this study, we compare the safety of amiostinone and procalinamide in treating patients with recent episode of atrial fibrillation. The results suggest that indirect comparisons suffer from undercoverage but are not as bad as indirect methods used to estimate intervals and hypotheses. A prospective open-label trial is performed to evaluate whether propaftenone or quinine is as effective as either agent in conversion of recentonset atrium fibrillations. We enlist 102 consecutive patients who had recently onset parosmal atary fibrilation; 89 were treated with propcainium, 91 was given prosafranone, and 92 was placebo. Conversion occurred within 24 hours in 32 of fifty patients -- 64 % male -- who were started on amiodraone therapy. RanoLazine has been proposed as an addon to Amiomedarone for treatment of new-set attrition. Although ranolazie does not convert spontaneously to sinus rhythm, its delayed action prevents it from acting immediately. This study also focuses on the effects of early-onset antiarrhythmical drugs such as flecasinide and imodar one on newly-formed attic fibrils."
31885541,"This study focuses on the effects of prebiotic and probiotics in nonalcoholic fat liver disease, or NAFLD. In this paper, we describe a doubleblind, placebo-control trial to evaluate the safety and efficacyof probiotase in patients with no alcoholism. We conclude that these studies are lacking in humans because of the large number of animal research. Aim: To evaluate infant formulations containing Probiotic/Symbiotic combination for safe and tolerance. The objective is to assess the effect of proicrobial treatment on hepatic fibrosus, liver proteomes, and inflammation markers in subjects with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease. After 6 months, ALT, Aspartate AmintransferAsses, as partate aminotransfusions; and ultrasound Grading of Nashi were assessed. Biomarkers were measured by magnetic resonance spectropography. These results suggest that proliferating yeasts may have anti-inflammatory effects in overweight and obesity patients."
29460165,"In this study, we compare the efficiacy of methylmethi date to dexamfetamine in children with hyperactivity disorder. The results are quite similar: there is significant group mean improvement from baseline score for both stimulants. We also examine the safety of buspiron over a long period of time and find that it does not seem to have any side effects. This study further investigates the use of memanine as an anti-distracted treatment for children's attention-defit/hypteractivity disorders. It was found that Memantine did not interfere with the normal course of action of other drugs such as bupropion or edivostetine."
15803086,"This paper focuses on the use of ""expert judgment"" in routine practice to predict whether patients with chronic back pain will be able to respond to treatment. It uses a cross-sectional sample of patients who have completed an exercise program as controls for their pain and injury at three and 12 months. The results suggest that expert judgment is useful in predicting the need for further treatment, particularly when it comes to patient's ability to work. In this paper, Anderson discusses the current state of knowledge regarding the efficability of exercise in treating patients suffering from chronic lowback pain. Although many studies have reported improved methods of therapy, there are still questions about its exact prescription"
30364990,"In this paper, we examine the effect of proton pump-inhibitors, histoamine H1 receptor antagonists, and other Types of ants on fracture risk. All subjects were subject to any fracture sustained in the year 2000. For each control, three controls were randally drawn from the back population. The exposure variables were used for several confounding factors, including diagnose of an ulcer or nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory drugs use, use of HistamineH1 antagonist's / stomach resecration, previous fracture, etc. This study was a prospective observational study concerning elderly patients who had been taking prescription drugs during their lifetime. It was found that proton pump inhibits were associated with increased risks of falls; however, it was not yet established whether this association was due to the use by these drugs."
28459099,"This paper focuses on the use of a walking program to improve blood pressure in postmenopalous women. It uses an extended walk-more trial to examine the effects of three different steps-per-minute goals for improving blood flow in sexed, low-active post menopausals. The results suggest that the goal of increasing steps per minute is superior to the one recommended by the American Heart Association as it relates to both physical and mental health. In this paper, we describe the rationale behind the design of the study and the method used to compare the effect of two community walks-based measures on bloodpressure in patients with high risk of heart disease."
24696195,"In this study, the authors describe a pilot study of an open-lab labeled combination of antipsychotics and an antidespressant. They report that patients with complete recovery after 35 days have generally been less depressed at baseline than those who had not. The results suggest that substance Ph antagonists may be useful for treating depression. A meta-analysis of 370 random drug trials is performed in order to determine whether industry-funded trials draw proindustiction conclusions or whether they reflect treatment effects or side effects. These studies are included in Cochrano's review of 515 published papers. This paper was designed to investigate whether the time course action of Antidepressants -- ADs -- and the typeof early behavior changes that precede recovering in treatment-responders were affected by the severity of their depression as well as the duration of follow-up. Both treatments showed significant improvements on the Hamilton Score for Depression; however, both groups did not show any change from baseline until week 2 or 4 of treatment. Paroxeten and imipramin were more effective in treating major depression when compared to paronoxetine. Paroxentine had fewer sideeffects than imiprimine, but no differences between these agents. Two serotonine reup take-in inhibitors are used as antidepressive agents: one inhibits serottonin and another inhibiting noradrenal nerves. Milnacutran is also considered highly effective because it does not interfere with neurotransmitters. It is reported that parodytine improves quality of life and pain in Type II Diabetes Mellitus. Another study compares efficacy against parometine in patients suffering Major Depressive Disorder. Although paronetine has pronounced negative effects on mental function, parophine seems to have remarkably similar effects upon symptoms of depression among elderly patients."
26378571,"In this study, we examine the effect of long-chain polyunstranded fatty acids, particularly docosolahexanoic acid, on endotothelial functions and risk factors in patients with atheotic stroke. We conclude that these effects are related to increased blood concentration levels of dissolved E-selelectin and VWF, which are important mediators of atheronegenesis. The results suggest that DHA may be useful for reducing the risk of heart attack because it reduces the amount of fat consumed by conventional diets. This study also uses a combination of two different Mediterranean diet approaches: 1) an all-out Mediterranean style diet; and 2) low-fat, Mediterranean-style diet. It is hypothesizes that the consumption of high-quality fats such as virgin olive oil or nuts can improve endometal function and reduce the risks of cardiovascular disease."
15513655,"In this study, Anderson focuses on the relationship between degeneration in the neck and the effects of injury on pain and other symptoms. He concludes that physical and psychological load at work are important risk factors for acute back pain. This study is a community-based observational trial designed to determine whether patients with chronic lowback pain can be improved by an exercise program. The results indicate that patients who return to work have lower levels of disability than those who do not return; however, there is no significant difference in muscle atrophy among these patients."
17923590,"In this paper, the authors describe a prospective, double- blinded study to evaluate pentosansan polysulphate sodium as an effective treatment for patients who have interstitial or chronic urostatic cystitis. They report that it is safe and efficacious in treating these patients. A pilot study was designed to assess the safety andefficacy of hyperbarric oxygenation on patients with interstrutial disease. The results were similar to those reported in other studies. PPS was more effective than placebo in relieving pain and urgency. This study also reports that there is no difference in response between BCG and placebo when compared to one another. Urinary tract disease, sensory bladder disorder, chronic mycobacterial diseases, and intertitial cystits are all unspecified conditions without rational therapy. Pentosolan Polysulfates has been shown to be highly effective in improving symptoms in patients suffering from interferential or acute forms of irritated urinary tract problems."
24200104,"This study aims to examine the effect of nurse-delired home visits and telephone intervention on drug adherence and quality oflife in HIV-stricken heroin patients. It is a long-term, placebo-controlled study that consists of 40 patients aged older than twenty years who met the DSMIV criteria for their opiate dependentness but did not fulfill Swedish legal requirements for methadon maintenance treatment. All patients were relapsed within one year after receiving buprenophine or another regimen of buprinorphinine. The primary endpoint at this study was 1-year retain in treatment and analyze was by intentionto treat. In this paper, we compared the effectiveness and costs-effectiveness with observed dosling of patients seeking treatments of heroin dependence. We surveyed two89 HIVinfected patients treated with clinicbased bp/nx regarding health-related satisfaction using the short form health survey SF-12. Our main end point was 1 year retention in treating and analysis wasby intention to treat ""Aims To compare the efficacy and cost-efficacy of unobservanced versus observed doessing ofpatients seeking treatment of Hero dependence."" Predictors are examined at 18 month post-treatment entries for 353 admitted patients to methaone maintenance who receive r and Om assignment to either medication only, stand and ard services, or enhanced services. A contingency condition was selected as it would improve patient retention and reduction of drug use."
26163249,"In this study, we examine the effect of human lactic acid-bacteria strain GG on acute rotavior disease. We found that the duration of the diarrhea was shorter in both groups than in the control group. The duration and severity of symptoms were similar in children receiving Lactobillus gg as well as in adults who had food allergy. Atopic emacia was also reduced in at risk children during their first two years of life. Children with an atopic disease received either probiotics or placebo for three weeks. They showed improved ocular symptoms and medication scores. Probiotic treatment was associated with improvement in immune system function. These results suggest that proliferative treatments may be effective in treating allergic diseases."

30687553,"In this paper, the authors describe a prospective, i.e. random, single-blind study of patients with psychosis who received either olanzepine, quetita pine or ristperidone for five years. They report that they found no significant differences in neurocognition between the two groups. The aim of the study is to compare the effect of resertional olibane palmitate on social function in patients suffering from schizophrenia. This trial was designed to determine whether the effects of these two different treatments were similar. After six months, both groups did not differ significantly in demographic and clinical features. However, there was some evidence that one type of treatment might be more effective than another. For example, we have developed an eight-week program of compensatory training for people with mild to moderate mental illness. It showed modest improvements across multiple brain domains but improved verbal memory after 6 weeks."
19526214,"The aim of this study is to determine whether whole grains or legume powders can reduce the risk of coronary arteries disease in patients with Type 2 diabetes. A diet consisting of either high-gluinous rice, low-GlycemicIndex, or white rice reduced blood glucose levels by 24 p.m. without altering weight and energy consumption. This study also examines the effect of an Australian sweet liclopioli fiber on serum phospholipid concentrations in men. In addition, it has been shown that legumes are better for improving blood sugar control in people with type 2"
28756133,"The authors examine whether tailored self-management supports can reach patients in safety net systems and explore variation by language, literacy, and insurance. They conclude that English-speaking patients are more likely to be able to participate in the safetynet system than those of other languages. In addition, they note that Spanish-language patients preferentially engage with these strategies. Cardiovascular disease is one third of the population's mortality difference among African American and White patients. This study evaluates an intervention for African Americans with Type 1 diabetes who have poor blood glucose control. A nurse-coated intervention was delivered between office visits as well as group medical visits. It was found that this intervention improved blood pressure, haemogen A1c, lipoprotein content, depression, physical activity, health quality of life, etc."
31093862,"A prospective study of 100 normal-women and 112 overweight premenopateous women is performed. The results indicate that adipostinemia is lower in the weight loss group, but there is an inverse relationship between the waist- to-hip ratio. In this study, we examine the changes in blood concentrations of microparticuls after weight Loss as compared to control groups. We conclude that laparotic adjustable gastric B and ing induce weight losses in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes. This study further investigates the effects of weight reduction on C-react protein levels. It was previously reported that bariatic surgery improves body mass index by reducing inflammation. However, it has not been shown to have any significant effect on systemic or inflammatory markers."
29257898,"In this paper, we describe the efficaciousness of a parent training program for children with hyperactivity disorder. We examine the individual effects of two treatments: Cogmented working memory training for adolescents and parental training as usual for mothers. The results show that both treatment groups improve on negative parents and home impairment but only Clas families also improve in positive parenting. This study investigates whether maternal attention-diffit/hypteractivity disease is improved by parent-childtraining. It was found that fathers were more effective in improving child behavior than their waitlist control condition. Furthermore, there are no other studies that directly compare the benefits of parent education to those of traditional behavior therapy. Parents who receive an enhanced behavior parent train program demonstrate greater engagement to treatment than those who do not. There are few empirically supported psychological treatments for patients with attention deficit or hyperaction disorder; however, many mothers have recurrent depressive symptoms. For example, one mother's intervention has been shown to be more successful than another because it involves ""two evidence-based treatments"". A second trial uses cogmed working memories training to treat young children suffering from attentiondeficion/hyperactivity disorders. Although these studies have not yet been published, they provide important information about the effectiveness of different types of treatment for adults with mental health problems."
20149117,"This paper focuses on three studies that relate blood glucose levels to mood. The first study examined the effect of consuming a high-glucose, low-carbohydrate meal on mood in two young adults; the second studied the effects of drinking glimmering sugar on memory and attention. These studies suggest that taking small amounts of sugar may be able to influence mood and behavior."
31485910,"In a series of controlled trials, Ferric Pyophosphate Cirate is shown to be an effective and safe way to replace iron lost by erythropic agents in patients with chronic kidney disease. The safety of this method has not yet been established; however, the use of IV iron as an aid to hemilysis has been proposed. A recent study suggests that IV doses of iron may lead to increased risk of infection in these patients. Although no association between iron levels and other risk factors exists, studies have suggested that there are some positive associations between ferritin-specific values and all-cancer mortality."
20693238,"This is a small, observational study of postmenopalausal women who have been taking raloxine for 12 months. It focuses on the effect of an education leaflet on patient adherence to treatment and its association with health related quality of life. In this study, we assess the efficacy of using bone turnover marker as predictors of persistence in patients receiving alendronates. We conclude that it is important for physicians to be able to use these markers to predict how long it will take for patients to get well after treatment."
26899439,"This study focuses on the quality of foot care practices among older adults in rural North Carolina. The results indicate that there are no significant differences between the severity of their foot problems and the frequency of complications. In addition, patients with Type 2 diabetes show greater improvement in their ability to care for their feet than those with conventional care. A second study is designed to determine whether an educational intervention can be used to prevent or delay foot lesions from occurring in patients who have type 2 disease."
24737108,"In this study, we examine whether adherence to the recommended regimen of blood pressure-reducing agents can be improved in patients with high risk of having a heart attack. The results of the trial are as follows: 1) A single pill contains aspirin, statins, and two bloodpressure-lowering agents; 2) A polypill consisting of three different drugs is used to reduce blood flow and improve lipoprotein levels in individuals with low-risk of cardiovascular disease. Although there has been some interest in using combination pills to lower blood vessels, no reliable studies have been conducted on either efficacy or tolerability. This paper discusses the use of ""fixed-dose combinations"" for improving patient safety. It describes ten large-scale trials designed to evaluate the effects of multiple antihysteria treatment strategies against coronary heart diseases and other cardiovascular conditions in people with varying degrees of risk. These include single-pil amlo dipine/atorvastin plus therapeutic lifestyle change, respectively. They also describe the effect of single dose therapy on blood control and lipid controls in adults with hypertension without any history of acute or chronic heart failure."
26487439,"In this study, patients were divided into three groups of high- and low-physiological reactors. The subjects' anxiety was measured by the Hamilton Rating Score for anxiety and a score of two patient-regarded scales -- symptoms checklist 90 and profile of mood states. Both groups showed significant improvements in their levels of anxiety over the course of the treatment. A double-blinded, placebo-control study comparing propranolal with chlordizepoxidine found that both drugs were more effective than placebo in treating anxiety. Simple tests of mental reasoning and verbal reasoning were also performed in this trial. Although buspirone has been shown to be effective in panic disorders, there is still question whether it can be used as an alternative medicine for these conditions. Brain Snack: Many studies have reported that serotoninate reuptoins are effective but that they do not seem to work as well in cases of panic disorder. This paper discusses the use of proprazolel in day-case surgery. It shows that although some patients lose their panic attacks entirely on either drug, all patients recover from their attacks quickly."
14678922,"In this study, we examine the safety andefficacy of two antiarrhythmically agents, amiadarone andpropafenon, in patients with acute atrial fibrillation. The first agent is an electric shock; the second is a direct transthoraic shock delivered by electrode catheters within the left-atrium. This technique has not been studied before. A hundred twelve patients are assigned to undergo internal or external cardioversion using shocks from 50-100 m. h. or 200-300 j. for one month after which they receive either dose of i butilide. After that, however, no conversion occurs. We conclude that ""clonidine may slow ventricular speed"" in elderly patients who have recurrent chronic atary fibrillation because of their high risk of stroke."
16717289,"In this study, we report the efficaciousness of a two-dose combination of antiemetic drugs in patients receiving long-term regimens of short-lived chemotherapy. We also describe the use of meto Clopramide to prevent acute and delayed nausea after three consecutive treatments with cyplatin. A double blinded trial compares the safety and efficiacy of an eight-mg ondansentron twice daily with placebo in treating acute or delayed chemotoxicated nausea and vomiting. The results are as good as those reported in other studies. For example, one patient has been treated with four different doses before he is rebuffed by another. Another patient receives only one single dose of deXamethaone but no rescue medication. This study determines whether the effect of neurokinin 1, phosphorus-responsive antagonist, can be reversed when given alone."
31232513,"Roux-y gastric bypass, or ryGB, is a surgical procedure that alters the anatomy of the intestine. The aim here is to evaluate the effects of this surgery on the drug disposition in patients who are pre- and after rygb. A single dose of fenobrate was performed in twelve volunteers before and afterwards in the same subjects. After two days, blood samples were collected at various time points upto 48 h later after administration. This study investigates absorption of either atorvastapin acid or salicylicic acid in obese patients. Both drugs have significant increases in area under the peak concentration as compared to the time to achieve maximum concentration. Posture affects gastific emptying. Preparations for biliotic diversion are difficult because there are many complications associated with these procedures. These include stomach ulcers, which can be fatal within the first year of surgery. Anti-reproviral therapy reduces morbidity by reducing the risk of weight gain. Morbidly overweight patients often present with mood or anxiety disturbances such as serotonine reupTaken from anti-retroViral treatment, dramatically reduced AIDs development, thus allowing patients to live longer than the general population. In contrast, HIV patients frequently fail to respond to conventional medicine. Therefore, an antirogatory regimen has been used to treat these conditions. However, it is not known whether this regimen will improve long-term outcomes."
24622671,"In this paper, the authors describe a large-scale, population-based, doubleblind, randozed placebo-controlled study to assess the effects of calcium alone plus vitamin D on the risk of fracture in patients with pleuricin disease. The primary endpoint was fracture incidence and the secondary outcome was an increase in the number of patients receiving treatment from two different anti-tuberculoses drugs. A comparison of serum concentrations of 25-Hysteriamin D levels in Tanzanian hospitalized patients who received treatment for pulmonary thrombosis is presented. This study also establishes that breast cancer patients have molecular features similar to those of control group. Furthermore, they report that type 2 diabetes Mellitus is associated with elevated levels of both interleuvinin 6 and C-Reactive Protein. These results suggest that inflammation may play another role in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus."
27039305,"This study aims to assess the interrater agreement, reliability, and construct validity for the Shoulder pain and Disability Index-SPADI in patients who have shoulder pain. The Norwegian version of this question naire, the Osteo-Rodical Question-Question-Distance, is used in an outpatient population study of people with shoulder disease. In this study, we cross-culturely compare the Norwegian versions of these question questions with those used by two commonly used measure-the Shoulders Pain and Distinction Score-Spad and the Short form 36-Doctor-Responsibleness-In-Pathology. We conclude that the Swedish version has better reliability and consistency than the English version."
26710217,"This study aims to assess the effect of an intervention to improve adherence to Dutch pain management guidelines for patients with low back pain. The results suggest that this intervention may lead to improved work-related self-efficiecacy, which can be increased when occupational health care is taken into account. A cross sectional survey amongst 66 occupational doctors was used to determine whether physicians were able to adhere to the guideline and report their own satisfaction with it. In addition, the results indicate that the intervention had a positive effect on return-towork."
24743931,"In this study, we examine the effects of an after school team sports program on weight gain in overweight children. Forty five obese boys were assigned to either one of three three-month interventions: AE, Re, or no exercise control. The effect of aerobic exercise on abdominal fat was examined by magnetic resonance image and intrahepatic lipid and Introhepatic Lipid were evaluated by proton Magnetic Resonance spectroscopie. Obesities are epidemic in Western society, with rapid increases in the young age. Atherrosclerosis begins early in childhood, and end Othelial Dyspheral dysfunction is itself its earliest detectionable manifestation. Physical therapy for shoulder pain has been inconsolable; however, several studies have found that manual therapy can be effective across all kinds of painful shoulder conditions. This study investigates the benefits of a 12-week twice weekly addition exercise training which comprised both circuit-base resistance training and athletic exercises. On body composition and blood pressure, both the exercise group and control group were divided into two groups: age 10.8+/-1.1 years, height=15.16 +/-0.0 8 m ', weight=61.1-6.1.4 kg. Both groups had different levels of health knowledge and physical fitness. Their differences in body mass index were significant. They also revealed differences between their diet, exercise, stress and smoking. These differences were not explained by parents' gender but rather by how they reported their weight at the time of the study."
18671894,"The effects of a daily multi-micronutrient supplement on growth, anemia, and morbity in children aged 6 to 11 years are examined. In the fortformed group, there is pronounced improvement in iron status, serum retinol concentrations, as measured by blood samples at baseline and after treatment. A study in South Africa examines the efficaciousness of multiple-minutriment regimens for improving growth during infancies. Two studies in India investigate whether weekly or daily supplements can improve infant health. One study compares three different types of single-meal capsules with one that contains zinc, iron, or copper. Another study evaluates how long-term iron stores can be restored in pregnant women from rural Bangladesh. This study uses two groups of infants: first, they receive daily doses of either iron or zinc; second, it is divided into four groups: DMM, P, WM, B. E. M. Each group receives six months of twice-weekly consumption of vitamin A, thiamomin, folate, arachidacin, serotonin, ferrous fumeate, etc. All subjects are dewormedas and their blood sample is collected at each end of the trial. Anemia has been common in low- income countries throughout the world, but many poorer countries have failed to provide adequate nutrition for infant girls. Iron deficitiency is particularly common among young girls who live in developing countries. Although most people do not know about this problem, several studies have investigated the effect of various forms of ""multiple"" micronutrientes on infant development. For example, we found that both groups received high levels of iron and zinc while only one group received mixed amounts of other nutrients. We also found out that some mothers had higher birth weights than others because they consumed milk-based porridge instead of dry bread. These results suggest that maternal Fe status may be related to pregnant pregnancy."
26620873,"This study focuses on the effects of an in-frared motion-tracking device on hyperactive boys with attention-disruptive disorder. The results suggest that detroamhetamine may be more effective than other treatment options for improving patient outcome. In this study, we examine the changes in behavior and motor function among patients with ADHD who receive three weeks of dextantrempheitamine sulphate or fen fluramine hydrogenchloride. We conclude that both treatments have significant effects on symptoms but that they do not lead to improved patient outcomes."
28650969,"In this study, we examine the effect of grade-d exposure on patients with chronic knee pain who report fear of movement or injury. We compared six consecutive patients who reported significant fear for movement and injury to determine whether there was a difference in the severity of their pain-related symptoms. The results showed that education and grade ""d"" exposure were associated with improved pain related fears and physical activity. A further study was performed using the Oxford knee scores as validated measures. This study also examined the efficacy of heat therapy in treating knee osteoarthrits."
32248344,"This paper focuses on the use of minimally-incisioned total hip replacement in patients who are not candidates for traditional total knee arthrooplasty. The aim is to compare the effects of the direct anterior or posterior approaches on pain and function, as well as to determine whether these approaches lead to shorter hospital stays. In this study, we examine the cost of total shoulder surgery from a patient's perspective. Costs were significantly lower for the anterior approach, with an average cost per cent greater than those for both approaches. We also assess the independent preoperative functions of patients after total arm resurfacing. A reduction by the indirect approach contributes to reducing costs from the hospital perspective; however, it does not improve long-term outcome."
27749375,"This study focuses on the effects of musical therapy on pain, anxiety, and behavior in children during nursing procedures. The results indicate that music therapy reduces pain and anxiety but also improves quality of life for patients with a history of severe emotional distress. In this study, parents are trained to use music and multi-modal stimuli to help their infants adjust to their new environment. Preterm and low birth weight prematurely born babies are given an early education in how to care for their newborns. Parents receive one hour of training in proper uses of music, multimodified stimulation, signs of overstimulation and techniques for avoidance. Children's stress is less appropriate for experimental subjects than for control subject. A focus of attention involving music may affect levels of discomfort and perceptionsof pain in pediatric immunations. Sixtiful children receiving routine Immmunitions were assigned to one condition: musical story, spoken story or sth and ard Care/control. They were divided into four groups: control, music only, progressive muscle relax only; and music combined With progressive Muscle relaxation. Results of Three-way Mixed-Design ANOVA indicates no major effect for group. These studies test effectiveness of medical music treatment in improving health related outcomes of heart patients. Heart patients suffer from high degrees of relaxation as well as excessive anxiety and pain. Although many studies have examined the benefits of physical activity on these conditions, few have evaluated the efficaciousness of such activities on organ transplant patients"
14974003,"This study focuses on the relationship between smoking and quality of life after amyotic heart disease in patients who undergo thrombectomy. The results suggest that smoking is an important risk factor for late myosclerotic infa-rct Ion and death. In this study, we examine the relation between smoke status and health-related satisfaction after treatment for coronary artery disease. We assess the relative importance of these two factors by asking patients to self-report their smoking habits. A survey of 1432 patients was performed at two different centers. Physicians were divided into three groups: those with no evidence of acute myostomy or sudden death; those without such evidence; and those who had quit smoking within one year of surgery. After follow-up, they found no difference in the risk of major events from both groups. They concluded that men who stopped smoking during their first myortomy had fewer deaths than those whom did not continue to smoke. These studies also showed that there was little association between tobacco use and mortality among patients with chronic diseases."
14763716,"In this paper, we describe the results of a two-year observational study in which patients with painful Hallux Valgus were treated with either surgical or orthotic treatment. After 12 months, they were assigned to either surgery or shoe therapy. The outcome was that both groups had similar risks for foot ulcerations. Both groups used their own shoes and received similar scores on the FFi-5pt scale as well as an adjusted score from the original version. This study is designed to assess the criteriometric value of ""the Dutch version of Foot Function Index"" in comparison to the standard version by using verbal ratings rather than physical analog scales. We also examined agreement between the Scores at baseline and upon one and eight weeks and the Scoring, Internal consistency, and Construct validity of the Foecuality Index."
28379619,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to reducing haemodydynamic stress in patients following an acute coronary condition. They use stepped wedges to predict whether or not treatment with renin inhibiting system will reduce blood pressure and improve left-ventricular function. The results of this study are reported in the accompanying Garde-timi 43 trial. This is followed by another study that uses cluster-based randomization to determine whether outcome reporting bias occurs in trials. These studies include two double blinded placebo-controlled pilot studies designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of aliskyren as an antihypertinesive agent for hypertension. A second study investigates the effects of combined vennin blockers on atherosis. It was found that both were safe but did not lead to significant reductions in bloodpressure."
23480090,"In this paper, we describe the effect of wearing body exhaust suits on wounds and infection in a surgical theatre. We assess the effectiveness of these suits by comparing air counts and wound bacteremia. The mean values of air count are 0.5 Cfu/m3 for BES and 1.00 CFU/M3) with Rotectno. A comparison of total body exhausted clothing to conventional theatre clothing was made in sixty- four patients who undergone total hip replacementusing the Charnary-Müler prosthesis. Both the means and median values were significantly lower when operations with Tbe-suits or conventional theater clothing than with conventional theatrical clothing. Preoperative whole-bodied washing with chlorhexidine detergent reduced the incidence of Postoperative wound infection. This study is based on 2468 published studies from 1988 until 2000. It uses threefold: 1) to determine thescientific quality of published trials in theAmerican Volume of the journal of Bone And Joint Surgery from August 1988 through 2000; 2) to identify predictators of study quality; and 3) to evaluate interrater agreement between the scores of two investigators. Results showed that the mean score was 68.1 percent  1.16 %; 60 p.. 40 %) Scored 775 pp."
24690623,"In this paper, we examine the effect of high-doses of vitaminD on patients with a history of heart failure. We conclude that low levels of 25HhV may contribute to poor muscle strength in older people who have been suffering from chronic inflammation and/or skeletal myopathies. This study is designed to determine whether higher concentrations or placebos can reduce the risk for breast cancer after surgery. The results suggest that there is no association between serum-25H HV and breast disease; however, it does not predict all-caluse and cardiovascular death. A case-control trial was conducted among more than 7, million US military men and women at age 57 years old. It found that blood levels were associated with increased risk of all causes and mortality during long term follow-up as well as reduction in fracture rates. Although some studies suggested that lower levels might lead to better survival, few studies have examined these effects. Some studies reported that elevated levels could be protective against certain diseases, such as stroke. However, many studies did not find any relationship between increases in 25OHH V and overall mortality."
25616710,"The aim of this paper is to develop based on an original classification of renal tumors suitable for neparoscopic surgery, to predict the risks of overall complications from the surgery. In addition, it will assess the effects of meat and other ancillary ingredients on the risk of developing RCC. A large US cohort has been studied in relation to disease severity and meal-related compounds. This study also includes a prospective phase 2 trial of active observation of 209 small renal masses with needle core biopsy. Pretreatment prediction of survival was modeled by Cox regression. Furthermore, patients were compared among age, body mass index, and American society of anesthesians class as well as mean tumor size. Both groups had excellent results without open conversion. There was no need for conversion; however, there was some evidence that interferonal therapy may be more successful in treating metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Laparotomy partial parisonectomy is now increasingly performed."
29883970,"In this double blind, omize-controlled trial, we assess the effect of 25-Hysterical vitamin D on metabolic control. The patients received a daily dose of 6000 iu.d. followed by 3,000 h.D. in phase 2, while the placebo group received matching placebo. This study is designed to describe the structure of biased trials and to provide an explanation for why they are performed. Biasiness can be explained by confounding or selection biases; however, it is important to note that these types of studies often use different terminology than those used in observational studies. For example, one type of bias may occur when there is ambiguity between the actual effects of the intervention and the expected consequences. Therefore, using causal diagrams as describing the structures of randomness will help ensure that the results are correctly calculated."
25834421,"In patients with obstrumental disease, both laboratory exercises and field walks are used to measure physical performance. The six-min walk test is one of the most commonly used tests in this study because it has been reported that it can be used as an outcome assessment in patients who have severe pulmonary disease. Aim: This study was designed as a prospective observational study at an academic health centers and associated pulmonary rehabilitation program. It was intended to assess repeatability by factors affecting its relation toquality of life in older patients but is not well studied in the aged. Methods: Thirty subjects with moderate or severely COPD performed two 6 minute walk tests and two Endurance Shuttle Walk tests. Each preceded by NIV or supple oxygen were divided into two groups. Sixteen patients had stable pity on the encouraged 6, minute walking test; 76.4 +/- 14.1 % compared with the encourage 6-minute walktest. BCGOBUND Previous studies showed positive effects from Non-Invasive Ventilation or Ambulatory Oxygen on exercise capacity for patients With chronic  Obstructive Phosphoid Disease. However, no evidence exists regarding the effect of using continuous tracks on walk distance. Therefore, we examined the relationship between track layout and walk length measured on different paths."
24289848,"This study consists of two groups of patients: 1) women with a fibromyallygia disease and 2) women who have chronic fatigue. The first group is an exercise program that involves exercises for pain, fatigue, and sleep. In this paper, the effects of exercise on pain are described. A patient's pain score is calculated by comparing pain scores to symptoms in the same way as those in other studies. These results suggest that exercise may be more effective than placebo in improving pain. Another study investigates the use of pulsed electrical nerve stimulation in treating musculodyskeletal conditions. It was found that there were significant changes in pain after treatment. Two different types of therapy were used in this study; one consisted of physical exercise and another of psychological intervention. One included hypnosis while the other included relaxation techniques. Although these methods had not been studied before, their efficacy has been reported."
26065374,"In this paper, we describe a control trial that compares two social communication approaches to children with an autism-spectrum disorder. The picture exchange system is used to teach imitation skills in young children who are at risk of developing an autism. We conclude that the program improves language and socialization skills for children without eye contact. A second study examines the efficaciousness of reciprocal playtime training on imitation abilities in children under age 3 years. This study also uses parent-controlled observational scales to assess the effects of early intervention on infants with high-risk or pre-Autistic Spectrum Disorder. It shows that both groups exhibit improved performance on measures of shared positive affect while joint attention and generalized requests. Both groups show improvement in their ability to communicate as well as improvements in other areas of development. Children with Autism have poor quality of joints attention; however, there is some evidence that they may be better able to initiate joint behavior when parents use child-centered response style. These studies suggest that early childhood intervention can help reduce the frequency of symptoms of Autus's disease."
31029060,"This study focuses on the pain of children with juvenile Idiopathic Arthritus, or JIA. It uses long-term follow-up studies from patients aged 1 to 16 years with new-on-onset disease. The aim of this study is to describe the changes in pain in children over time and to predict which children will experience ongoing pain. In this paper, we report the results of a prospective, observational study of newly-diagnosed cases of juvenile irritated arthritis. We used information from the American Childhood Association's annual meeting to estimate the prevalence of the condition in an ethnicly diverse population. Our main objective was to determine whether physical activity could be useful in managing pain for children who have been previously affected by Judgy ID."
28027038,"In this study, we examine the effects of icemic compression therapy on patients suffering from chronic carpal-tunnel syndrome. The results show that there is no significant difference in change in range of motion between groups. We conclude that an early passive motion regimen will be most effective for patients with extenso tendon injuries. A second type of post-surgery intervention is used to treat wrist fractures. This time, it is performed by a physically therapist who performs 12 exercises and does not involve any external force. After three months, all injured fingers are returned to normal function."
32359762,"In this study, we examine the effects of eight months of L-ACETYL Carnitine on body composition and metabolic parameters in nine patients with lipostrophy disease. After 8 months, the content of soleus has significantly reduced. The IMCL contents also have a significant effect on the weight loss. Carnitine is an effective treatment for polycytic ovaries because it improves blood vessel function and reduces the risk of peripheral neuropathy. This study compares two different forms of anti-cancer drugs, acetin-L-Carniline and sim vastatin. It shows that both regimens are safe and efficacious in treating patients who suffer from Type 2 diabetes."
28698929,"In this study, we compare the accuracy of long-leg angular and coronal component positions on patient-specified instruments in total kneearthroplasty. The results show that the precision of the instrumentation is improved when the surgeon chooses to use patient specific guides instead of conventional instruments."
26644891,"In this paper, we compare the efficiacy of five different probiotic preparation to parents in treating acute diarrea in children. We compared the effect of either Lactobillus strain G or Lacticillin-casei strain gg on treatment of acute and rotavir-infected patients. The results showed that Lactic strains were more effective in reducing the severity of both disease and duration of infection than they were in control groups. Children with mild diarrhea were assigned to receive one of two regimens: 1) oral rehidratation solution; 2) isotonary or hypotonic Oral Rehydration Solution; or 3) placebo. After receiving either option, children had a shorter time of watery Diarrh Oea than those who received only an ""oral reahydrate solution."" This was due to the fact that there was no difference in the length of their symptoms. A double blind trial was conducted in which children were divided into two groups: first, infants received either Lactaculus casei Strag GG or placebo; second, adults received Bifilace M. Both studies showed significant improvement in terms of reduction of episodes of severe and long-lasting diarrarium."
27226400,"Preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation is an effective treatment for patients with lung disease. In this study, we assess the effect of short term preoperative training on exercise capacity and post-resection complications in patients who have been treated for small cell lung cancer. We also examine the impact of long-term physical therapy on patient performance after a thoracoscopic or open surgery. This study compares the results of two different types of breathing exercises: inspiratory whistling and relaxation drills. It is concluded that these are safe and can be used to treat patients at risk of postoppressive complications."
29288248,"The effect of a conjugated lyinolic acid on body composition is investigated in subjects with Type 2 diabetes. A diet rich in n-3-LC-Pufa, alpha-LinOlenic acid, or fish oil reduces the risk of developing atherosclaotic disease. In this cross-over trial, subjects were assigned to either eat enriched with CLA or consume tetanical oils that contained different amounts of both fatty acids. This study was designed to assess the effects upon body weight and fat regain for moderately obese subjects. After an eight-wk run-in program, 100 subjects lost their initial body mass before being assigned one of three experimental diets: 1) ate cis 9, trans-11, and trans 10; 2) drank isomer of conjugated LINOLAC acid; or 3) consumed olive oil. These studies examined changes in body size and composition after consumption of these two dietary sources. They found that they reduced total cholesterol, increased HDLcholesterol, elevated serum proinflammatory cell markers, as well as improved blood pressure and heart rate. Although there are other studies showing the beneficial effects of certain lipids, it is not yet clear whether any of them have been shown to be effective in treating diseases."
22340263,"The European Heart Failure Association/European Heart Rhythm Society of the European society of Cardiology survey is aimed at describing current European practices associated with Cr implantations. A total of 13 European countries contributed data from consecutive patient successfully implantedas with accrificial device between November 2008. The main objective was to assess whether the benefits of BiV-pacing were sustained over twelve months. In patients with heart failing, biventricular resynchronation therapy has been shown to be effective in improving their quality of life and in reducing the risk of conduction delay. This study also focuses on the effects of cardial renouncement in patients who have permanent atrium fibrillation or sinus rhythm. Although there is little known about the efficacy of this new technology in these patients, it is clear that it may improve haermodynamic performance."
29556750,"In this study, we examine the effects of an evidence-based exercise program on patients with recurrent rheuumatoisd arthritis. We compare two different types of exercise regimens for patients: 1) an ""It"" group that uses only general information about exercises and physical activities; and 2) a more individualized training group designed to meet public health's recommendations for moderate activity. The results are very similar in terms of quality of life and disease activity after 12 months of follow-up. This is significant because it suggests that physicians should be more attentive to patient needs and values than they were before. A second study investigates the effectiveness of self- directed exercise among patients who have psoratic arthritis or other inflammatory diseases. It was found that these patients had improved their health status by improving their pain, fatigue, and depression. These patients also reported improvements in their ability to cope with pain at six months post-treatment."
17054258,"The aim of these studies is to determine the safety and efficacy for laparoscopic-cholestectomy as an elective treatment for acute gallbladden disease. In this study, a prospective cohort of patients with suspected bile tunnel leaks was studied. After comparing the results of early and delayed surgical treatment in patients who had acute choecysestitis, we conclude that there is no significant difference between early or delayed surgery. We also report that laposcopic cholestectomy has been used for treating acutely inflammed gall bladders. Although lapartoscopic approaches have improved the management of stones found in the common duke duct, it remains unclear whether they are effective in relieving such stones."
28795075,"In this study, we examine the frequency and severity of ankle spraineds among female college students. We determine that there is a significant gender disparity in the rate of these injuries when compared to menstrual women. This paper reports on the effect of estradiolation concentration on knee strength and injury rates in women and men. The results suggest that changes in estrogen concentration may lead to increased injury risk for both men and women"
31020768,"In this paper, the authors describe a case control study of neck pain in nine states. They conclude that whiplash injuries contribute significantly to the prevalence of chronic neck and back pain among Saskatchewan adults. The authors present ten years of follow-up studies of patients with Whiplash-Associated Disorders who have been followed for at least two years. Neck pain is an important cause of disability in the population because it is associated with both long-term and acute injury. Acute wounds are more common than non-accidental injuries; however, there is still little information about the association between these events."
25812929,"This study aims to examine the effect of an 8 day university course on psychological prognostics in patients with shoulder pain. Forty two primary care therapists attend this course over eight weeks to identify and address risk factors for persistent or chronic pain, as well as to determine whether there is any similarity between these factors. The results are that patients have persistent symptoms at 3 months and reduced functional disability at 2 months. A cross sectional postal survey was conducted amongst GPs who had recently been treated with LBP and were asked about their attitudes, beliefs, and reported clinical behavior. In order to explore whether the relationship between physical adolescence and therapy predicts patient outcome, this study was nested into r and Omized controlled trials. It was found that both groups had different levels of pain and disability after treatment. Although no specific disease has been identified, low back pain is the second most common cause of disfigurement in the United States. However, it is not yet clear whether physicians believe that they can be relied upon to treat such patients effectively. This paper uses semi-structured interviewes to assess what patients perceive as good medical communication and interaction when talking to physiologists. Thirty five consultations were taken with respect to History-taking, clinical examination, interrogation and engagement between patient and doctors. Methods: To determine how general practitioners'beliefs about lowback pain/LBP differ according to either their special interest in Back pain, Musculoskeastic &occupation medicine ;and whether these beliefs change by having continued medical education about back Pain inthe previous two years. Results: The aim ofthis studywas to Determine whether muskuloskeletal physical teachers... recognize when patients With low spine painare at risk of Chronicity due topsychosocial factors."""
21398350,"In this paper, we report the results of a double blinded placebo-controlled study to determine the efficacy of human growth hormone in short- statured children. The subjects were treated with either GH or placebo for three weeks until they reached adult height. At the end of the trial, mean heights were measured in 33 patients. A further study was performed to assess the effects of two different doses of growthogen on final height during the first year of treatment of 16 short children who received r-hagh. After 2 years, height velocity was increased significantly in both groups. This is not clear whether the effect of growing-hormone therapy will be permanent or temporary. We conclude that there are few studies of long-term outcomes of growth-harvest treatment in small children and that no one has yet reported on the long term outcome of such treatment."
24500904,"This study focuses on the use of continuous active motion in knee arthrostry. It is shown that this type of motion improves range of movement and reduces pain after two weeks and three months. A prospective single blind investigation was performed after total knee surgery to compare two rehabilitation regimens: one with constant passive motion and the other using immobilization. The results showed that both groups improved their knee function during the first post-surgery period. Both groups had similar pain scores, but no difference in early or late flexion at the end of the procedure. In addition, there were no changes in the length of time for each group. Post-tankatal knee replacement patients received either conventional physical therapy or CPM as an alternative treatment. They did not differ in pain, swelling, wound healing, or lengthening stay between the two groups. However, they did show improvement in functional ability following TKA."
16856115,"In a doubleblind, multi-center trial, Buspirone's efficacy is compared with that of clorabepate. Both drugs are well tolerated and have no side effects. The two agents are equally effective for treating anxiety in patients with moderate or severe anxiety. Two groups consisting of 12 outpatients each were treated single- blindd with placebo while the first seven days were followed by blasted drug treatment periods of four consecutive weeks. One group was treated with buspiron 5mg three times daily in the morning, 5 mg at the afternoon, and 5mm in evening during the next, third week, then 4 weeks on placebo. On the Hamilton Rating Score for Anxiness and the  symptoms Checklist were applied to assessment the therapeutic effects; followedby an on-The-Round Driving test that started 1. hours after the final drug or placebo consumption. All patients were assigned to receive different treatment regimens. They were divided into six groups: one group received either busprione 10m/day or diazypam 15mhm per day; the other group had been given either bovine trampler or abecarinil. These studies examined the safety and effectiveness of both antianxious and antidepressant drugs as well as their ability to improve patient symptomatic scores. Bickering was more frequently observed with bologna than with any other type of therapy. A new nonbenzdialzepine agent, buspar, was able to reduce anxiety significantly but with greater side effect. This study compares the efficiacy and safety between alprazolum and busspione in generalized anxiety disease. Alprasolam produces rapid and sustained improvements within the initial week of treatment, although it does not produce significant improvement over the course of the study. Brain Snack: Many people think that mental health problems such as anxiety should be treated immediately because they can lead to long-term recovery."
23544806,"In this study, we examine the effect of killed Lactobacterium acidophilus on reducing the risk of nosocolitis in preterm premature infants. We conclude that it is possible to use probiotics to reduce the severity and frequency of these infections by preventing them from occurring. Preterm babies are susceptible to pathogens because they have a higher sensitivity to infection than term-born children. This study also focuses on the effects of two different types of anti-infection agents: Bifidinobactericia longum bb536 and L. rhamnoses gg. The results suggest that both regimens may be effective at avoiding enterocotizing disease in very low birth- weight infantses."
21874111,"In this study, we compare the efficiacy and to tolerateability of two combination regimens: cisplatin-disphosphorus plus fluorophoricacil 5-FU or capecitebine-xelodas. The first regimen is superior to the second in terms of overall response rate and survival. A further study is performed on patients with advanced Gastric Cancer who have not received prior treatment. This study uses a novel approach to determine whether the addition of leucovagein improves the response of the combination of 5FU EI, MMC -- FEM -- over the conventional regimen of epirublicn, ciplast, and fluouracill. It was found that there was no significant difference in mean length of response for either regimen."
31147627,"In this study, we examine the association between leptine and carcinoma in an Indian population. We compared body mass-index, waist-hip ratio, and gleason scores of healthy men with and without prostate cancer. The results suggest that leprotin might have a beneficial effect on prostatic disease because it induces promotion and progression. This study also investigates the relationship between circulating c-peptide, which is known to be associated with pancreas secretion, as well as blood concentrations of both gluasome and lepanin. It was found that patients with higher levels of these two markers were at greater risk of developing malignant disease."
25953458,"In this paper, the authors present a new approach to evaluating voice disorder in the general population. They use laryngesoid electromyography to assess the integrity of muscles and nerves involved in speech disorders. The results of this study indicate that there are three potential risk factors for voice disorders: 1) increased risk; 2) increased severity; and 3) occupational consequences. A telephone survey is used to collect information about the frequency of voice problems among adults in Iowa or Utah. This report also describes the utility of single-case methods for determining whether adductor type spasmodically dysphonius or muscle tension Dysphonica is more efficacious than conventional approaches. Two published studies have been performed on children with acixa of speech. One has been piloted in Sydney, Australia where two treatment regimens will be studied. Another trial will consist of ten subjects who receive functional voice therapy before and after receiving LMT. These patients were blindly followed until the end of the study. Finally, each patient was asked to complete an outcome measure within one week of hearing recording."
25690684,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the relationship between spasticity and initial symptoms after stroke. He uses a prospective cohort study to examine patients with central parsis who have had an acute stroke for six months. The results of these studies indicate that there is no consensus on whether or not patients develop spasticity after hemic stroke; furthermore, it is believed that some patients may benefit from stroke therapy. This study also establishes the reliability of resting position, resistance to active movement, and the angles of appearance of resistance as measures of muscles hypertonous in patients after Stryphoid disease. A new device is developed to assess the velocity- dependent properties of elbow joints."
21936895,"This paper focuses on the efficaciousness of an after school dance class to reduce excessive watching among African American girls. It is a novel approach that uses family-centered counsels and behavior strategies to improve diet, physical activity, and ""sedentary"" behavior. In this study, overweight children were assigned to different treatment groups: intervention or control. The results showed that young boys were more physically active than girls; obese youth were less physically vigorous than their nonobeses. Although some studies have suggested that there may be an association between excessively long hours of leisure time and increased body mass index, no such association has been found. However, several studies suggest that eating habits are associated with increased weight in children."
25560629,"This study focuses on the effects of a virtual-reality-based training program on gait speed, balance, and gaits in patients with stroke. The subjects were divided into two groups: one group trained with an all-hands-operating robot while the other group was trained without any human intervention. In this study, we examine whether the use of both systems can improve gait speed and distance in people with chronic stroke after four weeks of either system. We conclude that there is no significant improvement in gaital speed or distance between the two treatment groups. A double blind, randomizedcontrolled trial is conducted to evaluate the efficacy of three-week physical therapy combined with walking exercises for patients who have been injured by concusses. Two groups are assigned to each group: the control group receives traditional exercise and the experimental group takes advantage of the newer technology of using real-world motion capture to track walking performance. Both groups participate in ardor and stout rehabilitation for six weeks."
28453714,"In this paper, Wollstonecraft discusses the use of a combination of group-based and participatory approaches to improve women's health in Africa. It is shown that the combined approach has significant positive effects on improving maternal knowledge of acute reinfections in children. The results are further supported by an extended period of follow-up surveys among 2814 mothers who were pregnant in five different districts in Bangladesh. Acute respiratory infection control projects have been found to be particularly effective in raising maternal awareness of signs and preventative measures for children under age 14 years. This study also shows that there is no negative effect of credit-bearing development intervention on women with low income. Furthermore, it suggests that ""the microcredit program can be able to catalytic agents"" in reducing poverty and gender inequality. Formative studies are used to plan intervention strategies. For example, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood institute funded the trial of activity for dolescence girls as part of the national effort to reduce physical activity in young girls. However, many poor women do not receive adequate education or access to financial services. These women often lack female empowerment and lack of formal education. Poverty and inadequate social capital are risk factors for child health. Poor women tend to neglect their own health because they live in close proximity to other women. They may also be vulnerable to sexual conflict due to economic shocks. Community-centered groups can help reduce child labor. We assess the impact upon two major concerns: 1) infant mortality and 2) womanhood. One community only had the health promoter and the other one had just the credit program. Both communities received similar results in terms of improved birth outcomes. Although these changes occurred at different time intervals, they did not result in any change in overall health status. Women'S groups could significantly reduce premature deaths in rural India. There was little difference in neonatal morbidity between men and women in both groups. Thus, we conclude that although some countries have limited resources for public health efforts, such as malaria and intimate partner violence, most governments have failed to address these issues."
23965711,"In this paper, we describe a novel approach to evaluating the importance of changes in quality of-life instruments by calculating the magnitude of change on an item-based scale. This approach is used to calculate the minimal clinically important difference between two measures of quality measure, the mean change in scores from three studies that measured fatigue, pain, and emotional functions in patients with acute heart disease. We conclude that there is little evidence for using these measures as outcome measures in patient-reported outcome surveys. The authors present four approaches to interpret outcomes: 1) use of body-parts-specific adaptive testing to generate outcomemeasures during rehabilitation; 2) assessment of responsiveness and minimum detectable change; and 3) evaluation of foot function using response theory. These methods are described in greater detail in the paper."
12939895,"In this paper, we describe a doubleblind, r-omized study of 70 patients who come to the dermatologist's office with primary or second skin infections. Thirtey-five were treated with topical morphine and 35 were given with fusicid acid three times daily for seven days. The results are similar to that obtained with murocin. A total population of 102 adults was studied in order to date whether analgesis was due to local aspiron or to systemic drug. Both preparation proved effective in treating acute primary skin infection. There was also resemblance between the two treatments in cases of secondary infection such as impetigopio. Muprobin was more effective than either treatment in terms of improving the severity of the lesions. Two other studies have been performed on subjects with different types of superficial skin diseases. One of them has been published in the medical literature. It is reported that both agents are effective at relieving the signs of infection in children."
23810272,"The aim of this study is to compare the effects of ovarian hyperstimation and the invitro procedure on brain development at three months of age. Children born through IVF are more physically, mentally, and emotionally developed than children born naturally after fertilization. This study also includes a follow-up cohort of children who have been treated with ICSI for their first two years. These children's mental and physical health are better than those of control children. In addition, they have higher scores on the General Cognitive Index than other children from the same age group. Furthermore, these children have lower birth weight, greater mean gestationalsal age, less hearing loss, longer pregnancy periods, shorter lengthier pregnancy intervals, etc."
16087812,"In this study, we assess the benefits of n-3) polyunstained fatty acids on mortality in patients who have recently undergone myocardiaal infusion. The results suggest that there is a significant reduction in risk of sudden death after regaining consciousness with exercise. This paper also discusses the effects of diet on long-term health and disease. A Mediterranean-style diet appears to be associated with reduced risk for all causes but specifically for coronary diseases. Consuming whole grain foods has been shown to reduce the risks of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease in men. However, these studies do not directly relate to consumption of fruits or vegetables."
29058055,"The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a grape seed extract on the in-vitodemineralization and bonding of dentinal fragments under caries challenge. Aqueous solutions were applied on acidetched root dentine before excite DSC, Variolink II, and clearfil SA; after microslicting the rootdentine, hear bond strength was performed immediately either after one year of water storage or after two years of treatment. This study investigates the effects of proanthopyanidin on bond reinforcement for fiber posts. Proanthosicin has been used as an anti-caries agent but has not been reported. In this study, EwB and collagen cross linker are used to improve bond stability of fiberposts to human teeth."
24049046,"In this paper, the authors describe a double blinded study of patients with acute psychosis who received either 5mg or 1mi.m. of halopridol during an aggressive incident. The results were that midasolam was superior in controlling agitated and aggressive behavior than either haloperola or loratzepam. They also compare the safety of these two antipsychotic agents to that of neuroleptic drugs. This is part of our clinical development of Accept-103, which we use to study the relation between oral dose, plasma level, and up take of it in human brains. Although neurotoxics remain the primarystay of treatment in the emergency room, studies have been performed as alternative or adjuncts for these drugs in order to improve efficacy on acute treatment. Twenty- eight acutely psychotics with schizophrenia who are admitted to an urgent psychiatic service were assigned to treatment by either half-blind condition; they were given either alprazolum or haploridal with placebo. After 24 hours, all patients received one to six shots of the same drug within 12 hour based on their need."
24405725,"In this study, we report that pain intensity and exercise interference are associated with worse outcomes than either disease alone. We use a mixed-effects model to predict the severity of pain and depression in patients with chronic knee pain. The results suggest that there is little activity interference among these two groups. Furthermore, only self-reefficacy, fear of motion, and other measures of healthiness appear to be independent predictors for less activity interferental pain during the 12 weeks of antidepressants. A further study is presented on the effect of newly developed knee painfulness on general health or physical function of persons aged 50 or over living in the local community. This study uses the Physician's Epidemiology Questionnaire as an instrument to assess the quality of trials used in primary care. It also examines the relationship between anxiousness and depressed pain in older people who have been suffering from knee injuries. These subjects were divided into three groups: those with no pain at baseline, those without pain after 2 weeks; those having pain when they completed the trial, but not before 3 months; and those who had pain while they were waiting for treatment."
23587198,"In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to weight loss by comparing four low-fat, high-protein, and carbohydrate-dense diets for overweight people with Type 2 Diabetes. They compare two different approaches in terms of how fast they lose body weight and how quickly they improve their health. The results are very similar: after six months, subjects lose more than twice as much weight as they lost before. This is an important finding because it suggests that there may be some drawbacks to the conventional methods of weight management. For example, one study found that consuming fewer carbohydrates led to greater weight gain but no significant changes in body composition or blood lipid levels. Another study showed that higher-carbogeneous diet was better for weight control when compared to lower-fibricated regimens. A second study examined the effects of reduced fat on weight maintenance in patients with type 2 disease. Although these studies have not yet been published, they do suggest that increased consumption of fat can lead to improved long-term outcomes."
29713547,"In this study, we compare the results of three different surgical techniques for treating patients with a low-grade left varicocele. The technique included open inguinals, laparoscopic approaches, and subecumbent microscopic surgery. We assess the outcome of these three procedures together with pregnancy rate, complications after microsurgical or nonmagnificent subingunially varicocelectomy. This study is designed to examine the effect of high-ligation vein ligations on serum total motility and pregnancy rates in men with an infertile family. It was performed from January 2000 to November 2003. All patients are examined before surgery and then again 8 months after surgery by objective examination, color Dopler ultrasound,and semen analysis. After all, it's possible to evaluate every patient at any time during the follow-up period. A prospective, controlled study has been made to determine the effects of treatment on testiccular function in young boys with and without Varicocles. For example, children with large left leg have more pain than those with small right leg. To further our understanding of the efficacy of both methods, two studies have been carried out: one group uses ""open"" approach while the other involves ""larposcopic"" procedure. These studies include 298 patients who were treated with either open or subinguinal approach. Both groups had similar outcomes. They also showed that there was no difference in the amount of pain between the two groups. Finally, they concluded that percutaneous stitching seemed to be an equal alternative to suberificial needle insertion in terms of blood preservation, premproval, recovery, etc."
27487986,"In this study, we examine the effect of a daily breakfast on brain function in schoolchildren aged 13-15. We find that children with higher levels of omega-3 fatty acid have improved their performance on tests of executive function. This is an important finding because it suggests that diets high in n-3 or phosphorus may be associated with improved mental health."
29445867,"This paper presents a controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of an electroderculosis-based treatment for children who are at risk of developing attention deficit disorder. The results suggest that this treatment may be more effective than other approaches, including behavior therapy and neurofeeback. In addition, it is shown that the use of electroderecysms can lead to improvements in both physical and mental health."
28025174,"This study focuses on the effects of physical activity on older adults. It is a population-based study and includes 615 communitydwelling elderly adults aged 50 years or older, r and Omly selected by electoral rolls. The results of this study indicate that high 25-hydroxyvitamine D and physical active activity are independently related to improved body composition/muscle function in older adult subjects. In addition, there is an association between elevated levels of PSA and increased age-dependent changes in brain and behavior in matched older patients with mild-to-mid-aged disease. A further study is performed to examine whether sitting time can reduce blood pressure in people with type 2 Type 2 diabetes. Although studies have shown that sitting for long periods can compromise health, no evidence has been collected on how these habits relate to other risk factors such as waist circumference and insulin resistance."
24798823,"This study aims to improve the predictability of mortality and Major Morbidity in older patients undergoing heart surgery by comparing the effect of walking speed with that of a measure of comfort. The aim of this study is to determine whether gait speed can be used as an important predictor of death in elderly patients who are prone to stroke. In this paper, we examine the relationship between low walk speed and the relative risk of dying from hip fractures. We use two different methods to estimate the change in performance: 1) using distribution-based measures for self- reported mobility and 2) using anchor-inferred methods for estimation of magnitude. Our results indicate that small changes in physical performance are not significant enough to predict major morbidities."
19251060,"In this paper, we examine the construct validity and reliability of six physical performance tests used to assess neck pain. The results are ascertained by a cross sectional study in which patients with neck injuries were divided into four groups: 1) awake, alert, 2) not intoxicated, 3) no pain or discomfort at all, and 4) no other painful or distractioning injury. We conclude that the decision instrument is sensitive enough to select patients who have low risk of injury but will allow physicians to perform more accurate examinations in unstable trauma patients. A set of five clinical criteria for selecting patients whom they believe should be given high-risk exams is developed. These include: ""no midline cervical Tenderness"", ""not focal neurologic déficitivity,"" ""normal alertness,"" and ""distracted injury."" All these factors are considered before being selected for use in the spine exam. Neck pain can also be associated with soft tissue structures on MRI. This study determines whether there is sensitivity to changes in three algo functional scales when measured using an electrode placed over the patient's neck."
25001582,"This prospective study focuses on the impact of various surgical techniques on Crohn's disease in terms of quality of life, recovery, and costs. The results suggest that patients with severe or moderate ulcerative Colitis seem to be well adjusted to their condition; they have few physical or mental problems before the surgery and do not suffer any social or professional disarrays. A large population of young adults with chronic inflammation-bowel disease are followed up for 10 years after their initial diagnosis. They report good health and work performance at all stages of their illness. In this study, we assess the validity of the Work Progressivity and Activity Imairment Questionnaire as used in the treatment of CD. It is found that there is no significant difference between the scores of these three questions in response to the question ""CD activity index."" We also examine the effect of long- term doses of inflipimab on patients who have moderate to severe IBD."
25620754,"In this paper, we examine the effects of energy density on diet when fat content is above or below a similar amount of fat that typically consumed. We compare the effect of personal preference to 'low-fat Lactoovocegetarian' diet and an 18-week trial of overweight and obese patients who were assigned first to one of either preference conditions: yes or no. The results of the study are as follows: weight loss, total cholesterol, ratio of lean to low-denish lipoprotein, HDLcholation, triacylaglyceryls, insulin resistance, and macro nutrients. After two weeks, all subjects have their blood samples taken at 0; 2; and 4 hr. A comparison of body mass index between four diet groups was made in order to determine whether these changes were associated with weight reduction, increased insulinsensitivity, improved cardiovascular health, or reduced risk of coronary disease. Both men and women had different BMIs but both had lower blood pressures than those in the other group. Although fasting has been shown to be effective for treating hypertension, it is not yet clear whether there is any role in improving heart health. Fasting may also help control Type 2 diabetes because it reduces appetite and increases blood vessel wall thickening. Another study suggests that reducing high-blood-glucose concentrations by consuming fewer refined foods can lead to improvements in overall health"
15654706,"In this paper, we describe the effect of morphine on tardive symptoms in patients with a severe form of mental illness. We compare the positive and negative syndrome scales with the Clinical Global Implications scale to determine whether there is an association between the severity of the symptoms and the cutoffs for treatment response. The results indicate that Pimozides can be used as an effective antipsychotic in acutely ill patients who have been subjected to excessive agitation. A recent study has suggested that using unpublished measures may lead to significant changes in behavior."
31167038,"The aim of the present study is to determine whether blood pressure reduction can be achieved by using a ""capture approach"" in which patients are given either an active or placebo-controlled drug treatment. In this paper, we examine the effect of different types of strokes on antihytensive treatments and conclude that there is no significant association between death or stroke for any particular group of patients. We also discuss the effects of body mass on hypertension in elderly patients who have low blood levels. A pilot study of high blood tension in the elderly program was conducted in 10 European countries with 1283 patients aged 60 over 80 years. This trial showed reduced rates of fatal and unfatal stroke among those treated with diuretic regimens; however, it did not show any significant relation to mortality or Stroke Morbidity. There were scant evidence on the affect of Body Mass Index on Cardiovascular Events and Death in older patients With isolated Systoic hypertention. Although non-drug intervention has had low effectiveness in preventing these events, some studies have suggested blockade from the Renin-Angion system may prevent Type 2 diabetes. These studies suggest that blocking the renine-angione system might reduce the risk but do not result in improved outcome in patients with Type 1 or Type 2, as well as other cardiovascular disease. Antihypertensesive treatment seems to improve both left ventricular remodelling and outcomes in people with type 2 Diabetes. However, many trials have found no benefit in treating such patients because they involve more than one patient with elevated blood level. Some studies indicate that angiotensol-converting enzyme inhibiting agent could delay or prevent atherosclad complications in diabetic patients without heart failure."
29064384,This paper focuses on the association between birth weight and early menarchity in a South African cohort. It uses an adjusted linear model to predict that faster post-birth weight gains are associated with an earlier age at Menarche than stable growth. The results of this study suggest that later age is also likely to result in increased body mass index and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.
27178217,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights et al. uses a novel approach to predict the absorption of calcium by two levels of 25H dithiopatra's active form of vitamin D: 1) pretreatment with 25h divitamin D; and 2) no treatment at all. The results suggest that children with low-dose deficiencies may be less likely to develop acute respiratory infections due to their high blood concentration of 25, H ditribe. This is an important finding because it supports the notion that there is some association between serum 25th divisiveness and acute pneumonia in Mongolian children. We conclude that these patients have lower risk of severe pneumonia than those with normal levelsof D. A prospective, randomized, double-blind study was conducted to assess the efficacy of daily doses of 100 IU of Vitamin D as compared to placebo in infants aged 1 to 11 months in Afghanistan. Children were divided into three groups: control group, which received only 500 mL of milk; intervention group consisting of 200 children who received either 1,500 mol/L or 300 ng/ml of both forms of VD. After controlling for age, gender, and severity of disease, we found that babies with higher birth-stage values had greater odds of contracting RSV than controls."
30006369,"In this study, we investigate the effect of diets rich in fat containing different fatty acids profiles on cardiovascular risk factor. We compare three different types of fat: coconut oil, palm oil and extra virgin olive oils. The first is a doubleblind, crossover study with 50 healthy subjects who were divided into three groups; the second group was assigned to either soybean oil or coconut-oil. After nine weeks, they were instructed to walk for fifty min per day. This trial showed no change in body composition over the trial but increased energy consumption and amount of carbohydrates. A further study examined the effects of beheic acid on serum phospholipid concentrations as well as lipoprotein concentrates. It was found that both oils reduced total cholesterol by sixteen - 21 percent, LDLcholesterol by 21  -- 26 %, and high density lipodyprotein cholesterol levels by 10 -25 pmol/L. Both oils also reduced platelet reactivité by all three regimens except for the palmoleine diet which had an even lower reduction in thrombiton formation. These studies suggest that low-fat foods are best avoided because they have more fat than their refined counterparts do. They also show that palmitic alpha-lainic butter has lowered blood lipid content when compared to other fats such as corn oil. However, it does not seem to have any significant effect on heart disease."
18058281,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether sertraline can be used as an effective treatment for patients with ""seasonal pattern recurring winter depression"" who are not depressed during the fall or winter. A random sample of 100 and eighty-seven outpatients with seasonal disorder were randomly assigned to either bright light therapy or placebo in doubleblind, multi-county, multiple-centre, parallel- group, flexible dose. This study compares the clinical features of these three different groups of patients: those with winter affective disorder, those without major depression, and those that do not have any symptoms of bipolarity. In addition, we describe 29 patients suffering from ""Seasonal affectively disorder"" which is characterized by frequent bouts of depression each year. Most of them have a Bipolar II disease but they also have other depressive symptoms. Bright light has been shown successful in treating both types of mood disorder. However, there is no significant difference on the severity of the antidepression response between the two groups. For example, one week of short-term light treatments had no change in body weight or oxygen consumption. Another study showed that brightlight was more effective than conventionally used for treating seasonal affectives disorder; however, it did not show any changes in ocular health."
24266676,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective study on patients with lowback pain who have not been treated for at least one year. We use multiple regression analysis to identify factors that predict future outcome in these patients and compare the effects of Chiropractic and Physiotherapy on these factors. This is important because it will allow us to see whether the new technology works as well as an established one. The main aim of the study is to determine prognostics for back pain at 1 year follow-up. A comparison between two treatment strategies is needed: 1) chiropractic and 2) physiotherapy. Although there are many studies reporting the efficability of different treatments, no evidence exists for their effectiveness or repeatability. For example, McKenzie's ""Rol and Morris Questionnaire"" has been used to assess changes over time in patients suffering from low back problems. However, when applied to individual subjects, it seems to yield reliable measures of disability. Furthermore, several studies have examined the relationship between centralization of low Back Pain and the performance of functional outcome. These studies include three groups of patients; thirty-six outpatients with chronic low spine pain; and 42 patients having failed disk surgery, spongylolisesthesis, and degenerate disk disease. All patients received relief of pain after eight weeks of vigorous exercise. Both groups showed significant improvement in physical fitness but were also found to be more sensitive to change than others. Another study was designed to examine the effect of back school on returning to work among patients experiencing acute work-retrieval symptoms. It was concluded that both exercises and other forms of therapy could be effective in relied upon to treat lower back injuries."
28826406,"This paper focuses on the use of age-related frailtiness as predictors of postoperative complications in elderly patients. It uses a large-scale prospective observational study to assess the frequency and severity of saropenia after gastriccan surgery. The results suggest that sedentary activity may be associated with long-term morbidity, but it is not yet clear whether this association is true."
28938794,"The American Heart Association recommends a diet low in fat and plant steros and viscou fibers, but this does not lead to significant reductions in blood cholesterol levels. This study compares the effects of two different diets on patients with Type 2 diabetes: i) an all-vegan regimen; and b) omically assigned subjects who were either overweight or obese. They were randomly assigned to either one of three diet groups: 1) A high-fat conventional diet; 2) A fat-modification lactoovocegetarian diet that replaced lean meat; or 3) A low-protein, dairy-free diet. In both cases, the results were positive. These studies suggest that consuming fewer refined foods may be more effective in reducing risk of heart disease than lifestyle changes alone."
25636220,"A double blind, controlled clinical trial is performed to determine if long-chain and medium- chain triacyllycerols can reduce body fat in overweight men. The subjects are divided into two different groups: those who consume the short- or medium chainstricerol oils for eight weeks and those that consume longer chainstriacylgels for 8 weeks. In this paper, we describe an oblique comparison of the effects of both diets on body composition, energy expenditure, substrate oxiation, and subjective appetite. We conclude that there is a trend towards greater loss of entire body subcutaneous fat with functional oil than olive oil. This study investigates the effect of ""medium- and long"" chain diacylics upon blood triblyceride in Chinese hypertrophic subjects. It was found that these subjects were divided according to age at least 60 years. Both groups had similar results in terms of body weight, body massindex, waist circumferentiality, hip circumfference, absorption of fat, as well as changes in visceral Fat area."
22006128,"In this paper, Wuthering Heights demonstrates that the use of an ionicomer-modified cement to bond orthodontic braces leads to less enamel degradation during fixed orthodontic treatment than does conventional resin-based materials. This is due in part to the fact that it is not necessary to remove enamel prior to directly bonding the brackets; however, there is some evidence that pumicing may have an effect on these results. The aim was to compare performance of bonded glass iconomers with composite resins when used for indirect bondment of orthodontic Bracket Type 1 and 2 in patients. Both systems showed significantly lower failure rates than the other. A newer self-curling resin modified glass-isonome cement, Fuji Ortho, was developed to improve resistance to enamel decalcification."
29240976,"The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and effect of combination therapy of aspirine and clodipogrel among patients with stable chest artery disease. In this trial, we report on the efficaciousness of combined treatment in patients who have minor strokes or transient attacks. We conclude that it is safe for them to receive either antiplatelet regimen after percutaneous intervention but that there is still some risk of bleeding during the acute phase. This paper also discusses the use of platelet-adhesion assays which are used to predict the effects of both antithrombotics and aspidin on blood recirculation. A sub-study was performed to determine whether two antiPlatlet agents could be more effective when compared to one another in terms of their ability to reduce the presence of ""mes"" signaling future stroke events. Although no studies have been published regarding the effectiveness of these two agents in treating large arteries, they do suggest that they may be useful in certain situations."
31172295,"In this study, we examine the effects of an omished weight loss program on blood glyceride concentrations and changes in body weight. The results indicate that consuming a low fat, high-flora diet may not be only reduced atherogenic tendency but also the ""thrombogenic tendencies"" of individuals compared with their average Danish diet. We conclude that the Mediterranean diet is associated with less risk of disease than the other two diets. This paper presents the results of our studies on children's health through the use of the New Norwegian Diet, or NND, which has been shown to have beneficial effects on both physical and mental health."
18489673,"The purpose of this study is to develop an educational intervention for women who are at high risk of breast or ovarian cancer. This intervention reduces the number of women seeking information about their family history and genetic testing, but it does not increase the intention to obtain testing among women with higher risk. In addition, there is a significant increase in knowledge and perception of risk over the six-month interval. A satisfaction-with-decision scale was used to predict satisfaction with health decisions. Most British genetics centers offer extended genetic counseling prior to hereditary disease. Twenty-six patients were randomed to extend genetic counselling before HNPCC test. Although anxiety has been associated with increased adherence to self-examinement, some studies indicate that general anxiety may interfere with routinely occurring self exams. These studies aim to clarify the relation between anxiety and acceptance of regular breast self examination by comparing ""general anxiety"" with that of tumor-specific anxiety."
27681948,"This paper describes a Latino-based, self-effacing intervention for patients with Type 1 diabetes living in the Texas- Mexico border. It is compared to usual care and results indicate that the intervention improves blood sugar control among Latin American Mexican Americans. The study concludes by examining the effect of this intervention on A1C scores, health beliefs, and disease severity in Spanish-Americans who have recently been newly diagnosed with type 2 or Type 3 diabetes. In this study, we examine the impact of an education program designed specifically for people with newly-diagnosed Type 2 diseases. We find that both groups show significant improvements in their knowledge, attitudes, behavior, etc. At three months' follow-up, the group shows significant improvement in terms of changes in selfefficacy, quality of lives, BMI, HbA1, and weight loss."
25966337,"This paper focuses on the effects of the new national health insurance program for older adults. It examines changes over time in drug use and costs among elderly people and welfare beneficiaries. The study compares outpatient cost-sharing with pre-costing groups, and additional analysis is conducted to compare older patients with or without chronic diseases. Prescription drug prices have been rising in the United states and Canada. Cost- sharing has led to significant decreases in expenditure and increases in drugs use for poorer persons. Prior studies had found little information about the impact of costing by prescription drug co-payments on patient adherence. However, this paper uses a cluster-rand-omized control group experiment to assess the effect of an extended period of no-copays/co-deductibles policy on prescribing behavior. In this case, it was not possible to determine whether the proposed rule would lead to savings or increase in overall health costs."
31828538,"In this study, we examine the effects of a single daily dose of L-carntine on patients with suspected alcoholic infamyria. The results show significant reductions in both groups over the course of the 28 day treatment period. We also assess the severity of disease in patients who are not at risk for alcoholism. A cross sectional study is performed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of non-alcoholic fat liver disease among eligible patients. This study was carried out by an Italian hospital as part of DionYsos project. Thirty-five patients were selected to receive either carnine or placebo. They were then divided into two groups: one group received only Carnitine; the other group took acyl Carnitine."
19158550,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the use of telephone surveys to track pain in Denmark. He discusses the importance of myofastic trigger points, or TrPs, as well as the reliability of physical examinations used for the diagnosis of these points. This paper describes a study using four trained physicians to determine the exact location of Trps in the quadrantus lumbar muscles of patients suffering from low back pain. The results of the study are described in detail. A majority of subjects have no evidence of their ability to palpate and an expert has not yet been hired to examine them."
23799418,"In this prospective study, the authors follow patients who undergo breast reductions and determine whether smoking is a risk factor for postoperative wound infection. They conclude that smoking increases the risk of complications after hernion surgery by as much as twofold. Acute lung injuries are particularly dangerous because they involve limited treatment options."
25173808,"Antihypertinesive effect on blood pressure in subjects with moderate-to-mediate hypertension. The starting dose of the anotensin I receptor blocker is shown to be superior to that of amalodipine, a calcium Channel blockers. A double blinded study compares the efficaciousness of two different antihysteria agents: amlopidine 5mg/benzazepril and amloro dipine 10mil. In patients with mildly to moderate essential hypotension, there are no significant side effects. Amladipines have similar effects on diastatory blood flow as do chlorthalidene or ammolopine. This study also examines whether psychological intervention can reduce blood tension in patients who have mild-To-moderate acute hypertention. It was found that psychological treatment could improve blood circulation in these patients. Although it has been reported that this type of therapy may lead to greater risk of heart attack, studies have suggested other methods for treating hypersensitivity. These include using sustained release preparations of nicarcrine and vasodiminous compounds."
27924055,"This study focuses on the effects of an integrated care program for stroke patients. The aim is to improve patient safety and quality of life by involving multiple risk factors in one patient's care. In this case, patients are assigned to different treatment groups. A control group receives usual care and another group follows up after 12 months. Although there is some evidence that exercise training can reduce the risk of new venous events in stroke survivors, little is known about its long-term efficacy."
32009497,"The aim of the study is to compare the efficaciousness of collagenasese and surgery for Dupytren's disease. In this prospective cohort study, patients aged 65 years old with a previously untreated Dupuyten contracture were followed for two years. This was an important step in the development of new surgical approaches for treating such diseases. CollagenAse Clstridium Histolyticum has been used as he first came out on the market but it has not yet been directly compared to other active treatment methods. Methods are described in this paper. Forty patients with metacar pophalangeal joints or primary isolated interphalangeals joints were enrolled; of those, 69 patients received openlabel colonlasing for dupuyertre disease--the most severely affected band was treated first at 74 %). After follow-up, ninety subjects with complete active extension defects of 60 o'clock or more were included. Aim We explore regional variations in how surgical management of patient with Duputythren 'disease"" was conducted in twelve European countries. Twelve countries participated: Denmark, Finl, and, Swedish / Nordic region ; Czech republic... Hungary.... Pol and East. France? Germany & Netherland and South! Italy "
23558383,"In this study, we examine the effect of a simple needle-sneeze technique on the muscle function of patients with chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. The subjects report no pain or very much with the Bergstrom needle as compared to the conventional biopsy. Muscle weakness is one of the most common causes of disease in patients after an acute episode of severe obstrumental disease. We investigate whether nerve stimulators can be used to treat these patients. A pilot study was carried out for 15 patients and results showed that neuromuscular electrodestimulation could be useful for improving muscular strength and endurance following an exacerbitation. This study compares the effects of daily physical activity with those of traditional exercise on improving health and risk factors. Hg: P =.002 ) and blood pressure: -5. 38 % / -6.89. There have been conflicting reports about the efficacy of hormonal replacement therapy on strength preservation but no effect on power generation. Women who had not taken HRT had greater gains in their muscles than women who did not take it. These women were older and more severely attenuated during the first eight days of surgery. They also had higher levels of myoin heavy chain and actin relative to total protein. To determine whether poorly reported methods reflect on poor methods, our study examined large muscle biopsie samples from healthy men and women. Men had smaller fibers and larger capillary densities while women had larger fiber areas. Type 2 diabetes has led to changes in both fiber composition and fiber roundness."
28024721,"In this study, the authors aim to develop an easy-to-use tool for predicting death and need for hospital care in elderly patients. They use the 7-pt. Clinical frailtiness scale as a validated measure of severity and then compare it with other measures that have been used to predict mortality or require for admission into an institution. After 5 years, they determine whether the score can predict death or needs for medical care."
29278423,"In this study, we examine the effect of a walking exercise program on leg pain and physical capacity in patients who have intermittent clausdication. The results suggest that an acute exercise intervention may be useful for improving leg symptoms. A new progressive treadmill training protocol has been developed to improve walking performance by increasing peak oxygen upput and power output. This is followed by comparing it to an established regimen performed at 2.0 Miles/h or 3.16 km/H. We conclude that strength training will be more effective as compared to conventional walking exercises because there are few medical treatments available for people with peripheralartery disease. However, no studies have examined the effects of any form of exercise on lower-limb function in persons with ""peculiar arterial disease"" such as pad. These studies aim to determine whether home-based activity can improve quality of life among those with persistent chastity due to peripheral artery diseases."
30219553,"In this paper, we describe a pilot study to compare the efficacy of mechanical bp in patients who undergo elective color-ectal surgeries with those who do not. The main aim of the study is to determine whether there is any difference in the severity of infectious complications between children who receive no bowel preparation and those that receive only mechanical preparation. We conclude that it is difficult to predict whether physicians will use mechanical or non-mechanic bicoid preparations for their procedures."
22083832,"Antimicrobial treatment of patients during their post-surgery period has been shown to reduce the risk of a wide range of complications, including surgical wound infection. Although evidence supports short-acting prophylaxes for preventing these infections, there is still practice to continue this for more than48 hours after surgery. This study compares the effect of two different regimens of antimbiotics on the rate of blood site infection and acquired antibiotic resistance in adult patients preparing for coronary arteries bypasses. The results indicate that both regimen are effective at reducing the frequency of postoppressive wounds but also have some drawbacks: they require sternaldebridment to prevent deep wound infections."
28813123,"In this paper, we examine the effect of blood pressure reduction on risk in patients with moderate to severe hypertension. We conclude that there is little evidence for a significant reduction in risk from antihypertinesive drugs in older patients. A Swedish trial in Old Patients With Hypertension was designed to compare the benefits of active and passive antihytertensives on the frequencyof fatal and non fatal stroke and other heart disease in elderly patients over 70 years old. The results are not as good as those reported in earlier studies. This study also reports on lifestyle changes in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hyper tension. It shows that diuretics are effective at preventing strokes but does not reduce the severity of the disease. Another study suggests that angiotensol-converting enzyme blocker may be more effective in reducing the risk of major cardiovascular complications than either type of diurtic or beta blockers. These two methods have been used successfully in several large European and American clinical trials. One of these trials, the Syst Eur Trial, has been carried out in partnership with the World health organization, international society of hypertention,the European Society of High Blood, and the International Society Of Antithropism."

21660022,"In this paper, the authors describe a double blind study in which they compare the effects of two different materials on patients' post-opportune tooth sensitivity. The first material is an amalgam liner, while the second is fabricated from copal varnish. This trial involves three different types of restorations: 1) bonded resin lines; 2) dentin bonding agents; and 3) resinmodified glass Ionomer lines. All four regimens are used to treat patients with primary caries. On days 2 and 7, subjects report their degree of pain at baseline and upon day 1, 3, 7 & 14. They also report how long it takes them to respond to cold stimulus."
24729336,"The effect of a combination regimen of calcium, vitamin D, and placebo on bone mineral density in elderly women is studied. In the first group, the daily dose of 1,500 iu/d increases serum 25-Hyphovitamin D by an average of 22.9 nmolg/mL; in the second group it decreases blood levels by 14.9 ng/Ml. After 6 months, both groups have similar results. A study was conducted to determine whether exercise and risk factormodification can reduce falls in older people. This trial was designed to assess whether either group of patients could benefit from increased bone loss or fracture rate. Both groups were assigned to receive 1,000 IU of alfalcidol per day for six months. There was no significant change in Bone Mineral Densities at any site during the two groups. Calcium and Vitamin D are associated with reductions in fracture rates in old people who live in sheltered accommodations. Women's health initiative has been established to prevent and control some of the common causes of Morbidity and Mortality among Postmenopalausal women. They include breast cancer, heart disease, osteoporatory fractures, stroke, mental health, low-fat diet, etc. These studies aim to identify the effects of different types of treatment on various aspects of bone health. For example, there is evidence that one type of therapy may be more effective than another when used alone. Two trials investigated the efficaciousness of three different forms of anti-mortal fracture therapy: 1) meth and Ienone, which reduced bone mass but did not increase bone turnover; 2) high-dose cadicilic solution, such as alchemy, combined with vitamins D and calcium; and 3) single-blind, double- blinded controlled trial, wherein each group received 100 hilcalciferyl capsules every autumn or winter. All four treatments had significantly different effects on hip bone density. Osteoprorosis risk factors and prevention-fracture prevention study were based on pre-existing risks of fracture and injury."
32028975,"This paper reports on the effects of an intervention involving child care centers in Switzerland. The primary outcome was motor skill and body massindex, physical activity, and quality of living secondary outcomes. Children received a daily dose of Fe-Folic acid from their mothers during pregnancy and after 6 months. In this study, children's health was measured by their vagal tone as well as their sleep behavior. A pilot version of the validated Idefics instrument was developed to assess the validity of both relapsing and non-relapsed studies."
27714911,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the acceptability, efficacy, and feasibility of a six-month after-school club sports program for weight gain in overweight children. Twenty-one boys were randomly assigned to either an after school team sport program or an established ""stand and ard"" exercise program. Both groups took part in two sessions per week from May to mid- November. This paper discusses the current state of knowledge regarding the efficacies of weight reduction intervention among childhood and adult obesity. Although there are no long-term studies on the effects of these treatment approaches, it is clear that they can be effective in improving health and fitness of overweight young children"
12519557,"In this paper, the effect of sublingual infusion of both labetall and dihydrallazine on blood pressure control in patients suffering from severe hypertension. This study consists of two groups: 1) pregnant women who have been treated with either drugs; 2) patients who are not yet pregnant but have severe pre-exaggerated or excessively high blood levels; and 3) patients that do not receive any treatment at all. The first group is composed of 200 consecutive patients with severe pregnancy problems. These patients were divided into three groups by the length of time they had received their treatment: short- term treatment for severely preeclampidsia, medium-term treatments for moderately preenclampsics, and long-lasting treatment of those with extremely superimposed preprimary conditions. Both results were very favorable. Pregnancy has many serious side effects, including encephalopathies and haemorrhage. Aiming to develop new strategies for treating these patients, we performed a double blind trial using antithrombus concentrates. After comparing the efficaciousness of each drug, it was decided that the most appropriate second-line agent would be ketansin. It was found that there was no difference between the doses used in the different studies. Furthermore, although the dosages differed according to the severity of the patient's condition, none of them showed any significant differences in heart rate or pulse rate."
30211331,"This is a controlled trial of joint-attention and symbolic play in children with an autism spectrum disorder. The results show that children who are r and Omized to the intervention have larger increases in their attachment-related behavior than children assigned to control condition. In this study, we examine the efficaciousness of Early Start Denver's parent-mediated social communication intervention for infants with severe autistic disorders. We conclude that early intervention can be more effective than conventional approaches for improving child development. A large, well-controlled trial is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of improvical music therapy on language delays in pre-kindergarty children without significant language delay."
30865287,"In this paper, Dr. Manette focuses on the safety of probiotic treatment for infants from poor-educated families in Bangladesh. He uses a doubleblind, placebo-control trial to determine whether Lactobacilus reuterius DSM 178938 is effective at reducing crying and fussing in breastfed children with infantile conlic. The results suggest that feeding prebiotics early in life can reduce symptoms of infantic colic by improving intestinal colonization."
31646739,"In this paper, we report the results of an experiment in which dance mats were introduced in two secondary schools in England with the aim to promote an innovation opportunity for physically activity. The effect of this experiment on physical activity was studied among 11- 13 year old students from five different school districts and two schools within neighboring control districts. This study is designed to investigate whether a combination of physical education and exercise can be used to reduce the decline in ""moderate to vigorousphysical activity"" among young girls in deprived areas of New south Wales, Australia. We conclude that this intervention has been effective in improving physical activities in children aged 9 to 15 years. A cluster random-effects analysis was performed across three groups: gender, weight status, initial physicalactivity level, and parental education levels. Our main outcome was measured by accelerometers at time 2; our second was calculated by mean count per minutes derived from actsigraph accelerometry. It was found that both 9 and 15 year-old girls spent more time sitting sedentally than their peers in previous studies. Although there are no direct evidence for changes in physical behavior between age 7 and 15, several studies have suggested that these changes may be due to differences in social class or ethnicity. These studies suggest that such changes could be caused by either change in body composition or lack of it. However, little is known regarding the temporal association between physical movement and fatness in primary schoolaged children. Therefore, this study examines the effects of multicomponent exercises on children attending low- income communities."
28060453,"This paper uses a novel, real-life model to predict the cost of an additional twelve-week course of treatment for patients who have successfully completed their initial quitting period. The results suggest that varenicle is more cost effective than bupropion in terms of improving abstinecement and that physicians should be given more time to educate patients about smoking cessations."
23417577,"A randomed controlled trial is designed to assess whether an eight-week pulmonary rehabilitation program would be as effective as a conventional seven- week program in patients with severe obstruive pulmonary disease. In this study, we examine the effect of long term oxygen therapy on health-respective quality of life for patients who have been treated with it for several months. The results are that patients show moderate improvements in their disease-specific Quality of Life across all four domains and that they appear to be much better than previous patients when compared to those who did not respond. This study uses Panax root extract to evaluate the effects of ginseng on chronic ostentatious psoriasis. It is shown that ginseng can help improve symptoms in people with mild to severe acute onset of COPD."
31527625,"This study aims to compare the protective effects of dipeptidyll peptidasese-4) inhibitors on blood glucemia in patients with Type 2 diabetes. In this open-landabel, parallel-plot trial, 16 patients were assigned to receive either vildaseglipnin 50mg twice daily or sitaglipitin 100mw twice per day. After 12week treatment, each drugwas replaced with the another for another 12 week period. The aim was to evaluate whether gemiglipten vs Sitagriptin or Glimmepiride could be used as initial combination medicine with metformine on gliescemic variability; and to assess relationship between dpp4 inhibition and Hba1c levels. A total group of 69 subjects with hafia 1c greater than 7.5 %) were divided into two groups: one group treated with vealdaglipin or glimetiide, and the other group received metformedin. Both groups improved their mean amplititude of glucose excursions during the following 12 weeks. They also showed a significant reduction in the change in Mean Amolemic excursion when compared to the control group. These results suggest that both groups may have an advantageous effect on cardiovascular disease."
27163747,"In this paper, we describe the use of six activity-monitoring devices in patients with a chronic pulmonary disease. We examine the ability of these devices to predict physical activity and energy expenditure in subjects with an obtrusive pulmonary disease known as COPD. These devices are validated against the doublying labeledwater method by comparing their performance to that of other wearable devices. The results suggest that they can be used as accurate tools for predicting physical exercise and body-mass weight."
29596650,"In this study, we examine the effect of idized salt on thyroid function among children in rural South Africa. We compare two different fortified salts-one with iron as ""mgfepp"" or EFF; and one with ferric fumarate as isopure. The results show that both groups improve their response: free thryroxine, total ironbinding capacity, and Uriny Iodines concentration. This study also determines whether iron deficitiency affects TSH function in India. It was previously reported that selenium has been used as an anti-thyroid peroxinase agent but it has not yet been shown to be effective in pregnant women."
31993718,"In this paper, we describe a study to determine whether physicians and patients will be better able to respond to the urgent need for physical therapy for older adults with fractures. We conclude that there is an insufficient care gap between the health needs of older people with fragility injuries and the treatment they receive. A patient-centered approach was developed to address this gap. The aim here was to improve the quality of care provided by primary care doctors who were at risk of further fracture or had recently received any type of treatment for osteophilis. This intervention was based on evidence from two controlled trials: one using randomized control and another using usual care. These studies found no significant differences in the outcome measures between groups. Osteophorosis is prone to morbidity, mortality, and cost. However, only minority of elderly people receive adequate treatment. An education program was designed to increase the use of bone mineral densitometers in women aged 50 years and older. It was also used to assess the effect of general practitioner's prescribing behavior on reduction of long term benzodyzepines."
24236629,"The aim of the present study is to determine whether a regimen of long-term aspirin therapy or rate control can be more effective in patients with severe hypertension. In this study, 534 patients were assigned to either an anticoagulation regimen or ""rate"" control group. After three years, there were 12 embolic and death events in groups 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Quinidine was found to reduce significantly the frequency of atrial fibrillation during '1 year follow up period after successful electrical shock conversion'. A new class III drug, azimilide, has been studied in many patients who have had syphilis. This trial uses donedarone for treatment of patients suffering from atrium fibrillation. It showed that it could improve survival by restoring sinus rhythm. However, it did not lead to improvement in all cause-specific mortality. Atrial fiberias are very common and frequently associated with morbidity but recent trials have failed to prove their efficacy. These include dofetilides, which are used to treat paroxysmal atarrhythmies; flecainine, sothalol, and amide. They also showed no reduction in risk of permanent arrhythmian formation."
16764546,"In this study, three experienced chiropractic physicians examine 21 symptomalist subjects and 25 patients with acute back pain. The results of the examinations indicate that there is good agreement among examiners for palpable pain over  Ostouseous structures and soft-texties. This study also determines the reliability of an eight-segment segmental examination strategy used to examine lumbar segments. It was found that concordance in each segment was noted for temperature differences between adjacent segments as well as for visual inspection of segmentar abnormality. A multidiscreet expert panel recommended twelve of these tests to be examined against unequivocally painful pain after an Intraarticular Anestry into the Sacroiliac Joint. These tests were not accepted by the American College of Physicians because they did not have sufficient evidence to diagnose a specific disease. However, several other studies have been published on the use of physical measures such as the ""Physical Impairment"" Index or the presence of certain trigger points in lowback pain sufferers."
22899657,"In this paper, the authors present a detailed description of the technique of second-look Laparoscopic Ovariolysis for women with syphilis. They describe the results of two groups of patients: first, in which laparoscomy is performed without puncture; and second, wherein only suturing is used. The results are similar to those obtained after initial Cesarean Delivery. This study compares the efficaciousness of unilateral ovaries drilling with that of open ileomecolectomy for Crohn's disease. It was found that there were no significant differences in the rate of postoperative attachmentesion formation between the two groupings. Adhesion related readmissions were frequently sequelaed to surgical procedures. These complications included blood loss, transfusion rates, post-operation infectious and nontoxic complications. Aiming to determine the effects of short-lived absorption on peritotal wound healing processes, we examined the effect of electrodecautery or ultrasonic desection on tissue injury. We concluded that it was not possible to predict the extent of these adhescensions at each site. Thus, our aim was to compare pre-operative adheresionforming and reproductive outcome following the same opsificial surgery procedure performed by long-term la parosomy. Our goal was then to assess the frequency of Post-Opplication Adhasion Formation After LaParocomy With Subserous Sutures or interrupted Figure 8 Suture. Although autocrosslinked Hyaluronic Gel did not reduce the incidence of acute adhesessions, it showed some improvement in pregnancy outcomes."
21342080,"In this study, we describe the safety and effectiveness of ecstasy in patients who are 18 or 80 years old with panic disorder. The primary measures ofefficacy were the percentage of patient free of full symptoms panic attacks at endpoint. We also report that gabapanentin is more effective than paroxenetine in treating Panic Disorder. A doubleblind, parallel- group study was conducted on twenty-four patients with panic disorder to compare the results of two different drugs in the management of these patients. Both groups showed significant improvements in their efficacy as measured by changes from baseline in number of attack attacks. This study concludes that sertraline can be used as a first line treatment for panic disorders. Although there has been little evidence of superiority between sertriline and imipromine in terms of tolerability, several studies have suggested that combination treatment may be more successful. For example, an eight-week open label trial found that fluvocxamine reduced anxiety scores significantly when compared with other antidepressers."
19300236,"This paper reports the results of a large, well-planned, and well designed study of the efficacyof prophylaxes in the treatment of open fractures. It was based on rand and ommized, doubleblind, placebo-control studies. In this paper, we report the outcome of an eight-patient, single-dose trial of ceftraxone in patients with deep wound infection.

No significant differences are observed in the appearance of either material over one year; however, retention of both material is below the minimum prescribed by the ADA acceptance program for dentine and enamel adhesives. This study also evaluates the clinical performances of three different types of restorations: 1) Optibond Solo, 2) PromptL-Pop, and 3. The results of these studies indicate that there is no significant difference between the treatment methods used for tooth preparation and the use of ""soft-start"" polymerization. However, the loss of any remaining fillings from the restorative materials is noted."
28089943,"In this paper, we describe the effects of green tea consumption on body weight and fat-related Hormones. We examine the impact of a decaffeined green extract on anthropometry, obesity-regular hormones, and blood sugar homeostases. This study is an open-label, parallel-trial with 937 healthy women assigned to one of either GTE 1315mg total catechin/d, or another placebo. The results were as follows: 1) Affective changes in body mass and metabolic pattern; 2) Biochemical changes at baseline and at trial end; 3) Leptin-Adiponection Ratison Score was determined. It was furthermore determined that leptenin had been associated with atheroscy susceptibility but that it was not yet established whether these changes were due to polyphenols such as reseratrol or caffeine. Our aim was to determine whether two different doses for six months reduced concentrations of Cl-Reactive-Protection and improved the metabolic patterns of T2D patients. These studies were carried out in 237 overweight subjects who were assigned either decaserate Gste or other placebo-controlled trials. Type 2 Diabetes mellitateus are controversial because of its anti-inflammatory nature. Therefore, our aims were then to investigate whether rsveratroll supplementation at twice different dosages would reduce the concentration levels of C- Reactive Protein and improve the Meta-Roleal characteristics of type 2 diabetesmellitus patient. At first, both regimens did not result in any significant change in disease severity. However, after several months, however, they showed signs of improvement."
23079882,"In this paper, Anderson et al describe the results of two different approaches for total hip replacement: 1) through a single incision and 2) through an ard or st-arm approach. The results are similar to those of other minimally arthroscopic approaches. Anderson concludes that these approaches have superior outcomes because they involve less risk of infection and shorter recovery times. He also discusses the benefits of using fewer incised wounds than with traditional total knee rotatorplasties."
22907934,"The diet quality index of pregnancy is calculated by calculating the number of servings of grain, vegetables, fruits, folate, iron andcalculatory factors. A worksite health program has been shown to improve cardiovascular risk factors in workers from St. Louis, Missouri. In this study, we examine the effects of two different physical activity exercises on various health outcome: blood pressure reduction, body fat percent, shoulder andback pain reduction. This study also investigates the effect of food labeling with the choices nutrition symbol on cafeteria selection and the behavior determinant of menu choices at work site stores. It was found that schools with strict enforcement of smoking restrictions were more likely to have lower rates of acute heart attack than those with no such restriction. Girls' troop leaders are trained to implement an environment-based intervention designed to prevent overweight in children aged 6 to 10 years. Two studies examined the association between objective and perceive neighborhood environment characteristics and parental concerns with active walking or bicycling to school. These studies investigated the relationship between objectivity and perceived neighborhood environments and parent concerns about active commmuting; these studies revealed that parents had higher concerns for their child's walkability and economic status than they did about their home environment. They also examined whether a mass media campaign promoted walking and fruit/vegetation consumption in low- income minority neighborhoods. Although many studies suggest that taxation may help reduce consumption of healthy food items, little evidence exists regarding the impact of such taxes on weight gain."
27827899,"In this study, we examine the effects on blood lipid and glucose concentrations in healthy subjects by using a double blinded crossover trial. All subjects consume four sweetened beverages for three weeks each: medium fructomese at 40 gram/day; high fructosese HF, high sugar HG & high sucrose. The subjects were divided into five egg consumption groups according to their responses to one question - ""Oldest"" or ""Noble""  -- and then they were assigned to different food groups. This study examined the relations between dietary carbohydrates, dietary fat, fiber, and magnesium with risk of Type 2 diabetes among women with body mass index less than 29 mm/m2 but not without other confounding factors. We also examined whether there was an association between added sugar consumption and type 2 disease. Consumptions of sweet beverages have been shown to increase type 1 disease in the United State. However, few studies have examined how these drinks can be associated with both type1 and adult mortality. Acute consumption of fruit has been reported to improve energy expenditure and absorption of carbohydrate. Short-term studies suggest that acute consumption increases energy efficiency and reduces the severity of insulin resistance in people with type 2, especially those with poorer glucose tolerance. These studies are followed by two further studies designed to assess the effect of simple v complex carbohydrates on weight loss in overweight adults. One study investigated the long- term effects of changing the ratio of low-fat and high-complex carbohydrates. Another study looked at the relationship between total and mixed-carbohidrate content in patients with Type 1 Diabetes. Although many American Heart Associations advocate that women should not consume too much sugar from all sources, no evidence exists regarding longer-lived metabolic effects when consumed at levels similar to the general population."
30864143,"In this study, we examine the relationship between physical exercise and fitness among boys and girls in Brazil. Boys are more likely to be involved in organized physical activity, meeting the recommended daily routines, and playing sports. Physical education classes are associated with muscular fitness. The quality of reporting on controlled trials is not as good as that of recent methodological studies. Overwheling evidence shows the reliability and legitimacy of trial findings; such systematic error is serious damaging to these trials. A second aim of the study is to investigate how physical activities, physical performance at age 16 relate to adult health habit, dietary consumption, smoking and biological risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. This study was performed in two groups of students: men and women. Men had higher levels of leisure-time activity and females had lower scores on physical education. Both genders showed greater signs of physical fitness than their peers. Children were at a particularly high risk for childhood obesity because of their elevated body mass. Thus, this cross sectional investigation reports the association Between childhood weight status, measures of physically activity/fitness,and fitness in relationto travel mode to schools in children and teenagers. We examined the relationships between body composition, cardiorespitory and muscular strength in relations to travel modes to school in Norwegian children from before conception until age 9 and 15 years of age. Our results indicate that resistance training can increase spontaneous physical movement in young children. However, there is little information about parental influence on children's grip muscles."
32161987,"The benefits of using a pre-operative drainage system for patients with swollen pancreatic heads are unclear. In this study, we compare the use of an endoscopic retrograde cholangopancreatogram to conventional surgery in patients who have soft panceras and nodal ducts. We conclude that it is not possible to predict whether or not prophylactic irrigation will reduce the severity of complications after pancoctoduodonectomy. This study uses chewing gum as an intervention against postoperative nausea/vomiting. It was found that both methods were effective at reducing the risk of Pancreic Fistula but did not result in improved long- term survival. Preoperative body composition has been associated with reductions in overall survival; more recently, sensitivity to blood loss has also been reported. A change in routine feeding strategy from Nasojenius tube to early oral feed improved clinical outcomes. These studies aim to determine whether changing the regimen of fluid restriction during pancoratodeodenectomy would reduce surgical site infection. Although there are many studies on how these changes affect patient recovery, none of them have been published. Postoperative tuberculosis is primarily due to delayed Gastric Empting following open surgery. However, some studies have suggested adding polylactic film to prevent such complications. Some studies suggest that enteral immunodose may improve patient survival after major abdominal surgery by decreasing gastric emptyation. Other studies indicate that entryal nutrition can be useful in improving wound healing. Finally, several studies attempt to assess the effect of specific earlymobilation on postoperative complications in highrisk patients."
29309534,"Fall prevention is important for reducing the risk of fractures in older people. A comparison between high-velucity resistance training and traditional low-repetitance resistancetraining in elderly men and women has been made. The effect of high speed power training on muscle performance was investigated. In older adults, peak power declines faster than strength at advancing age; however, different tasks require greater velocity or greater force components. This study examines the relationship between gait speed and change in gaits speed in community dwelling elderly people who are not dementia-free. It is believed that slow gat speed may be related to changes in disease severity but no studies have yet examined this relationship. Power training increases muscle power more rapidly than endurance training. Strength training improves physical function in patients with motor impairments."
25754299,"This paper focuses on the effects of weight-related behavior on overweight and obese children and young adults. It uses a mixed-race sample of girls and boys aged 9 to 14 who completed surveys between 1996 and 2000. The outcome measures were age-and-sex-specified z Score of body mass Index, BMI. A modified cognitive-behavior treatment was used for weight management that addressed both the psychological costs and thephysiological health risks of excessive weight. In this study, we examine whether dieting is associated with weight changes among children or adolescents. We conclude that it is not possible to predict change in weight by looking at an individual's body size. However, there are several studies that have examined attitudes toward obesity within food and nutrition professions; these studies have yielded mixed results, and none experimental research has examined the impact of dieteticians' attitude on their treatment practices or health evaluation"
23334071,"In this chapter, we examine the hypothalamy-pituital-adrrenocortic axis of major depression. We use a choleric agonist, Physostemine, to investigate whether it can be used as an effective antidepressive agent in patients with major and bipolar disorder. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the role of brain chemistry in depressed patients and found that scopoline showed rapid antidespressive effects in both uniliteral and Bipolar depressants. The results suggest that mild to moderate depression may involve disturbances other than disturbed ""muscaninic"" cholinemic mechanisms."
24082040,"The effects of two new anti-and-rogenic ingredients, Desogestrol and Gestostrel, on serum levels of lipoprotein. Estrogane is a novel contraceptive that does not induce changes in sexual behavior or mood. However, it has been shown that the use of this contraception can lead to changes with respect to body mass, blood pressure, and free androgen index. This study compares the effect of low-dose Org2969, which contains norgestrate, but with 35 microgram destel; or Marvelon/ Desolett, an alternative form of estradiogenel for women who have no prior use. A six- cycle, multi-center, open-labeled, double-blinded trial comparing the clinical experience between two low dose oral Contraceptives : one containing 150mg desoGEStrel plus 30mcg ETTinylEstradiol -- Ortho Tri-Chyclen -- and another using levonorent aceticolic as well as norethinerone aciticate -- LNG. Women receive three different regimens of treatment. They are divided into four groups: first, they receive daily capsules consisting of either 200microgram destogestrell or 300microgrimps EETHINYLESTRADOL; second, each tablet contains 100mG lenoxoric ACETICOL; and third, only 15mCg LENTORIGNESTRECL. In these studies, both pills produce significant increases in all the carriers proteins. These results result in significant differences among the two groups except for HDL cholesterol ratio. Both pills increase total andfree testosterone. Two other drugs, Yealland's Yamin, reduce the frequency of breakthrough bleeding or breakdown spotting by up to 50 percent in female patients. Although there is some evidence that such reductions affect sexual activity, no evidence exists regarding their efficacy."
28370209,"This study compares two methods of measuring flow rate in an elderly patient population. The first method uses a machine to assess the frequency of salivary flow, while the second measures the need for braces. A modified version of the Swedish Dental Hybrisation Score is used to track the needs of patients with malocclusion. In this paper, the use of thermography and magnetic resonance to diagnose temporomandiasis is described. It is shown that the Vanguard can accurately diagnose both symptomatic and diseased subjects. Caries is also examined by comparing the results of three different tests: 1) CraniOm and Ibular Index; 2) Schirmer Touch test; and 3) DPSI."
25359356,"This study focuses on the relationship between the six-min walk test, the incremental walking test and the cycle ergonometer test. The aim is to determine whether the 6-minute walks test can be used as an assessment of functional capacity for patients with mild or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Aims are to assess repeatability in the 6 minutes walktest, factors influencing it and its relations to quality of live in elderly patients who have chronic airways disease; measures are taken from 15 subjects with stable adulthood. In addition, this study uses the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Assessment Score as outcome measure. It was introduced by the American Thoracci Society and Medical Review Council in London. Thirteen subjects were recruited with four dropsouts. Two studies showed benefit from oxygen during pulmonatory rehabilitation but no clear benefit at resting. Six minute walk tests such as the endurance shuttlewalk test had not been widely used because of their small size. However, several reference equations exist for predicting the total distance traveled during these tests. These results suggest that exercise tolerance may be improved in patients suffering from chronic lung disease due to its simplicity. Walking tests are frequently used to predict survival in various diseases. Although there has been some conflicting results, most studies have found little evidence regarding the reliability of the 7-Min Walk test in healthy subjects. Some studies report that the 8-Mild Walk Test is superior to the 12-Hour Walk Measure in terms of accuracy and validity."
25459568,"In this study, we compare the performance of a carbon fiber reinforced carbon post in combination with an alloy control for the treatment of severely damaged teeth. The results show that the post is more effective than the conventional post at improving the patient's bite and long-term survival."
26342482,"In this paper, we describe a prospective study of the effects of pre-and post-bariatric weight loss and eating behavior on patients who undergo gastric surgery. We conclude that ""preoperative"" or ""standard"" care is not sufficient to prevent long-term changes in body weight. This paper also discusses the use of exercise as an intervention for weight gain after bariatic surgery because it has been reported that exercise can improve blood sensitivity but does not lead to significant weight reduction. The authors report that there are few studies reporting results from these treatment regimens."
23885775,"Back pain is a common problem in the nursing profession, but there are few studies that relate back pain to work-related symptoms. This study focuses on nurses' ability to predict lowback pain and how this affects their patients' health. The results of the study indicate that high-risk nurses tend to have more frequent complaints of low back injuries than those who don't suffer from them. A second study investigates the effect of body mechanics training on nurse workers' injury risk. In this study, nurses learn to use mechanical lifts as preventative measures against backaches. Nurses receive physical education and exercise to reduce backpain."
30422266,"This study aims to investigate the effect of nabilione on pain and hyperallgesia as well as other biomarkers in cannabinosed central nervous systems. A double blind, placebo controlled cross-over study was performed in 30 healthy men who received single doses orally of either morphine or delta-9-thc. The effects of both drugs were compared in terms of pain tolerance. Although no significant interaction occurred between the two drugs, there was an increase in tolerance for the experienced group. In this study, the authors used an experimental pain modeling approach to assess the effects that could be obtained from using different forms of cananbinol. They concluded that it would be more effective to use caninolics such as thalcysterol than to employ conventional methods of treatment. Their aim was to determine how canonabinoids may reduce pain by modulating the central nerve system."
25427435,"In this study, we examine the efficaciousness of a new anti-tumneous agent, sulphatasaline, in treating patients with an acute inflammatory disease. The results are mild and suggest that it may be useful for some patients who have not yet recovered from their diseased condition. A double blind trial is performed to determine whether hepatoprotection against infection can be achieved by treatment with either 5-aminosalticylic acid or sterile salpazine. After two months, there is no significant change in any of these parameters. This study compares the effects of both drugs on symptoms of ankylasing pondylitis: pain, stiffness, sleep disturbance, finger/ floor distance, Iga levels, and C-reactation protein. Both groups show improved measures of activity. However, they do not show any improvement in the severity of the patient's illness. Another study is conducted to assess the safety and effectiveness of Etanergent in patients suffering from anaklosing diseases. It is shown that steroid therapy does not work as well as other treatments because of its side effects."
22506694,"Low back pain is the second most common cause of disability for the U.S., and there is a growing body of evidence that this condition is not only largely idiopathic but also ""non-specific."" This group of patients has been misdiagnosed as having no specific disease. In contrast, studies have shown that sitting can be an effective strategy for relieving lowback pain. The use of exercise balls in replacement of office chairs has some merit."
30631593,"This paper describes a workplace health promotion program that is designed to improve physical activity and nutrition among employees. The results of the program are assuage concerns about overweight and obesity in the United States. A team-centered intervention with an individual motivated interviewing has been found to have positive effects on body massindex and weight gain at one year. In addition, this worksite exercise program reduces the risk of heart disease by reducing blood pressure and increasing the frequency of exercise. This study concludes that there may be some merit in addressing weight loss among low-society workers."
22090798,"The aims of this study are to compare four psychological treatments: grade-d in vs. exposure, cognitive treatment and supportive therapy -- to evaluate the benefit of combining these two treatments with an in-vivotic exposure. Brain Snack: Many studies have found that anxiety-related disordered patients can be cured by using ""cognition"" or ""gradient"" approaches; however, few controlled trials have been performed on such patients. In this paper, we examine whether D-Cycloserine, a partially agonist at N-methyl/d-Aspartate Receptor, will improve survival in humans undergoing behavior-induced exposure as well as in animals. We also investigate whether it is possible for cortisole to induce panic attacks during natural panic attack. This study uses feigned fear from blood collected before and after the actual exposure to determine whether corticosol is involved in the process. Furthermore, our study shows that there is no evidence of cortosol's ability to increase the frequency of spontaneous panicattacks in rats. A further study confirms that imipramine has significant antidepressing effects in combination with Cognitive-Behavior Therapy. Another study suggests that C-BBT may be more effective than placebo in treating panic disorder."
26567234,"This study compared the effects of risk reduction over four years on patients with an atheroscy-strengthened heart. The results showed that weight loss was superior to usual care in terms of reduced severity and improved quality of life. In addition, this study found that nurse run preventive care delivered by nurses could be more effective in reducing the frequency of acute myomyocardial disease in older patients. A nurse-based prevention program for elderly patients who had been discharged from hospital after an acute chest pain episode was shown to have a significant impact on their health. Nurse-led intervention was especially effective when it was used to improve lifestyle changes in patients suffering from unstable angina."
27871122,"In this study, we assess the safety of a new ablation technology that uses pulmonary vein isolated to achieve single delivery. The results suggest that cryoballon abations are more effective than drug therapy in treating patients who have paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. We also describe an earlier study on the use of pulsemonry vein isolation as an alternative to conventional methods for treatment of long-term atrium fibrillation: Mantra-Paf. This trial compares two different approaches to treating chronic atarrhythmic disease: 1) circumferential and 2) medical rate control. It is concluded that these two approaches are superior to one another in terms of efficacy."
27834223,"The Experience Corps is a program that places older adults in public schools as volunteers to improve their health and social well being. In this study, we examine the effects of group nursing on older people's feeling of loneliness, social activity, and psychological wellbeing. We conclude that family meetings are superior to usual treatment for patients with dementia because they involve two separate groups of individuals who receive individual counseling and support. This paper discusses the benefits of community-based approaches to improving physical health among older Americans. It also discusseses the use of intergenerationals to reduce loneliness among elderly people."
24188134,"In this study, we examine the effect on quality oflife in patients with prostatic hyperphosphorusa who do not improve after a loading dosage of alpha-1A enobarbus. We define'responders' as patients who improved by at least 5 points in the InternationalProstate Symptom score. All patients are treated with 50mg naptopidil or 75ml daily for 12weeks. The efficaciousness of both regimens is compared to that of other alphanoceptor blockers such as Tamsulodine and SiloDosin. A multi-centre rand and ommized trial was performed to investigate the effects on sexual function when alphosergic antagonists were used for treatment of lower Ury tract symptoms. This was an open label, controlled study conducted in Japan. It included 56 men with lower urine tract signs who had an international prostatesymptom score of eight or more. They were assigned to receive either silodasin 8m/day or navticut 75 mg hcloride each day. After four weeks, they were subjected to assessment of their health-related qualities of life. Both groups showed significant improvement in terms of Prostate Score and Quality of Life. NafTopidils has been approved only in Japanese for treating lower urinary Trestick symptoms associated with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. However, there is still uncertainty about whether it will be appropriate for white, black, Hispanic males having benignprostatichyplusa in western countries."
19888792,"In this paper, we describe the results of a large-scale, long-term study on the relative benefits and costs of two different approaches to treating patients with spontaneously pneumonia. The first approach is using chest tube insertion but in many cases there are recurrances of the disease. We conclude that it is the best possible treatment for the ruptured ""bleb"" because it can be treated completely radically without risk of repeat throbbing or death. Costeffectiveness was also examined in this study as well. A comparison was made between the use of percutaneous translucl Coronary Artifice Therapy/Angioplasty technique and the conventional method of bypass surgery. This study showed that the cost of both methods was similar at one year's follow-up. However, the rate of death, stroke, ormyocardial Ion ion were significantly higher in the second group. Furthermore, these patients had lower events-free survival rates than those who received either type of therapy. These studies emphasize the importance of managed care organizations taking into account the economic impact and efficability of their services. For example, colorectarian cancer has been studied in Latin America and several countries have adopted an educational program designed to improve patient health."
27233078,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective study on patients with Type 2 diabetes who underwent Roux-En-Y Gastric bypass. The results were quite different from those after lifestyle change and intense medical management. After two years, the patients lost more weight than before; they had improved their Hba1c levels in both groups. This was an important finding because it showed that surgery is not as effective as other approaches for treating type 2diasis. We conclude that surgically induce weight loss may be more effective than traditional methods to control blood sugar in obese patients."
15626993,"Back Pain Functional Scores and the Neck-Disability Question Observer-Survey A prospective study of patients with chronic back pain. The outcome measures suggest that all are appropriate for measuring change in functional status, but among chronic patients ""the RMDQ,"" ODI, DRI, and Nrs were most appropriate."" In this report, practices and 1-month results are presented for nine chiropractic patients and forty medical patients who have acute or a repeat low back discomfort. This report also includes ten other articles concerning patient education. These include an observational cohort study to evaluate the relationship between post-operative computedtomography findings on patients' clinical outcomes about four years later after laminoplasty for lumbro spinal stenotics. An educational booklet was not associated with either functional capacity score or work status; however, the opto-electric device scores did not relate to either function capacity scores or changes in work condition. Muscle spasm was found to correlate with cortical electrodes on magnetic stimuli. To determine whether these devices may be related to palpatory muscles spax, several studies have been performed. One of the most important goals of this study is to compare the ability of two disease specific question quesels and one general health question instrument for patients suffering from lowback pain: the Rolandry Disability Index, General Function Score, Zung depression scale, Oswaldry Low Back OutCome Score questions. It is concluded that the response of these three instruments depends on the accuracy of their measurements."
22160462,"Prognosi studies are investigations that future events or evaluating associations between risk factor and health outcomes. The results improve our undert and eding of the course of disease and assist physicians in making informed decisions about how to manage patients. Prognsis also informs treatment methods by helping identify sub groups of patients who might benefit from new treatments. In this paper, we describe an intervention protocol for treating hip fractures with osteopororosis. It is a patient-centered approach designed to increase the rate of treatment within six months. This study was followed by another one on cost effectiveness. A case manager could reduce the rates of appropriate Osteoprasus treatment by 51 % over usual care compared with 42 %) for usual Care. An economic analysis was used to determine cost effectiveness of it comparing with usualcare."
23539309,"In this study, the effects of walking exercise on leg pain and improved physical capacity are compared in patients with chronic intermittent clausdication. A supervised walking program is more effective than a conventional exercise program for improving functional performance. The results of this trial indicate that omization to strength training can improve walking performance as well as improvement in other symptoms of peripheral arterial disease. For example, an arm-craned group of patients has been shown to have improved walking speed and time by comparison to control groups. This paper also describes the effect of resistance training on myoin heavy chain expression, fiber type, and capacization in people with persistent atherosclerosis."
31115827,"In this paper, we use a real-world meta-analysis to predict the effect of an eight-week exercise program on health outcomes. We calculate the effects for each trial by sitting down the sample size in order to get sensitivity to differences between studies. For example, our results show that there is no difference in the treatment effect for knee training among workers who are at high physical activity. This study also shows that it is possible to increase the frequency of exercise with little risk of overdose. Aim intervention fidelity describes how well an experiment is conducted and how accurate it can be. It is important to note that many studies have not yet been rigorously evaluating the efficacy of different types of exercises. Therefore, here we present 'a rigorous quantitative assessment of intervention fidelitity'. Seventeen young men were assigned to two exercise sessions every week after which they had their blood pressure, heart rate, and body mass measured. The aim was to determine the effectiveness of ""electronic encouragements"" to do daily stairs walks at work with colleagues among adult workers in sedential occupations. Methods An 18-year-old male construction worker was assigned either an exercise group or control group. After 12 weeks, the exercise groups trained 3 times per weekly. Although its obvious advantages, few studies has examined health outcome of regular starclimbing. Many studies report that walking improves resting autonocic function but few examine the impact upon physical capacity."
24953955,"In this paper, the authors describe a study of the protective association between high concentrations of 1,75-dihypvitamin D -- 25-OH)D -- and the development in 7 rarer types of cancer. The results of this study indicate that there are no protective associations between higher concentration levels of 25, H.D., and breastcancer risk. A double blind trial is performed to determine whether daily dose or placebo of vitamin D at 400 or 1,000 IU per day reduces blood pressure for elderly women. This study compares the effect of alfalcidol against bone turnover in older women with Osteoprasis. There is no significant association when stratified bypre-and postmenopalusal status; local, region, or distance recurrance or death."" Calcium and Vitamin D have been shown to reduce fractures in patients with low-25-hydroxyvindic D levels. However, these studies do not show any relationship between their use of calcium or vitamins D and increased risk of heart disease. Women's health initiative, an organization designed to prevent and control certain common causes of Morbidity and Mortality among post menopausalsal women, has recently been established. It is intended to provide evidence regarding the effects of various different treatments on bone mineral Density, Biochemistry, Bone Mass, Muscle Strength, Fat Burning, Blood Pressure, Cardiovascular Disease, Pancreatic Carcinoma, Breast Cancer, Urinary Tractitism, Antitumor Activity, Polyp Prevention Trials, etc."
29941852,"In this study, we investigate the effects of an ionic-rich carbohydrate meal on post-surgery pain scores. We conclude that patients treated with a high-carbohidrated meal have improved their insulin resistance and reduced their risk of complications after total hip replacement. Furthermore, our study shows that pre-operative immune nutrition can improve the length of recovery in patients awaiting total knee resurfacing. This is especially important for older adults who are at risk for muscle atrophy due to age-related changes in body composition."
30684171,"The effect of a gastric bypass on the weight loss of patients with type 2 diabetes is investigated. After 10 kg loss by either Gbp or diet, the results are similar to those of other patients. In this study, we examine long-term effects of bariatric surgical Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass on body weight, appetite, fasting, and postpral and ieal gholrelin andpeptide levels. We aim to determine whether early weight relapse occurs after surgery in subjects with poorer blood chemistry than before. A double blind study is performed wherein all patients who undergone ryb for morbidly obesity were assigned to either LSG or RRYGB. All patients were evaluated at one month, three months, six months -- one year -- and two years later. This study was designed to assess changes in both patient's sensitivity to insulin and their response to food. It found that there was no change in glucose tolerance or in leptinal concentration after ryb. However, it showed that glucago-like phosphorylated peptidate-1 had an important role in weight gain."
19091760,"The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of adding a flexible sigmodoscope to the blood test H-IiI on the detection of colorecent neplasia in patients with chronic knee pain. In contrast, the combined procedure resulted in higher diagnoses than for the single procedure. Osteostarthrits is an inflammatory disease that frequently affects the joint. Bosweia serratia extract has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and analgeic activity. A double blind placebocontrolled crossover study was performed to assess theefficacy, safety andtolerability of boswellian serrata Extract in 30 patients who had osteoarthritises of knee. This study also examined the effect of BSE on quality of life and symptoms in subjects with collagenous Colitis."
29857555,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of breastmilk on infants with very low birth-wound weight. He uses a sample of 212 prematurely pregnant babies who have been admitted to the hospital during 1992-93 and follows up at 30 months' corrected age in order to determine whether or not these effects are permanent. The results of the study were as follows: 1) preterm children fed either bovine or donor milk; 2) preterminated infant girls fed only human milk because their mothers did not feed their own milk fortified; and 3) infant boys fed both types of milk but had no significant gains in growth over two months. This was followed by an evaluation of early post-birth growth in prematurous infant women who were fed express breast milk instead of cow's milk formula. Although there were no differences in overall growth between groups, it was observed that younger group received faster growth than those fed more conventional diets. A recent meta-analysis showed that feeding exclusively human dairy within the first fourteen days of life reduced the risk of nosocomial enterocotis. However, many studies have suggested that high levels of maternal milk may be protective against Necrotizing Enterocolitis. These studies also suggest that higher proportions of human cream or goat milk can be used to reduce the risks of NEC. Furthermore, they show that even when given directly from the mother, the incidence of infection is much less. Finally, Hamilton discusses the creation of ""Prosero,"" formerly known as the International Prospective Study on Preterm Infants, which has been developed by the British Council of Review S and Dissension."
26489667,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet in overweight children for at least two years. The results suggest that the diet may be an effective strategy for weight loss and improves both body composition and blood glucose levels. In addition, the study finds no evidence of any significant negative relationship between fat and protein. Although there is some evidence that this type of diet can help with weight Loss, few studies have examined the effect of these diets on other important health outcomes. For example, one study suggests that consuming too many refined carbohydrates leads to increased blood sugar levels but does not lead to improved overall health. Another study examines the association between gilycemic loading and serum highsensitivityc-reactiveprotein levels in obese children. This study concludes that ""fatty liver is highly susceptible among obesity"" and that it is recommended that young children receive either an experimented low glutemic load or conventional low fat diet for six months."
26244049,"Aims: To evaluate effects of zinc on blood glucose, lipid profiles, and serum Creinine in adults with adult-onset Type 2 diabetes. Methods The patients were divided into three groups; group A was given either an all-out zinc solution or a combination of two different forms of Zn. After four months, blood samples were collected at baseline and then after 4 months they were taken to assess bloodglucose, fasting blood sugar levels, glycosylation, creatinines,and other biomarkers. In this study, the effect of antioxidants on changes in body mass index, lipophosphorylation, as well as rapidity of response to antigens is studied. This study also examines the effects that long-term zinc supplementation has on serum total cholesterol, low density Lipoproteincholesterol, high-denisitylipoproprotein, but no change in HDLcholestrol levels."
30187176,"In older patients with Type 2 Diabetes, a new form of therapy is recommended. Lisenatide, an over-the-counter drug, is shown to be superior to placebo in terms of blood pressure and body weight change. The safety of this new type of treatment has not yet been established. However, there are some studies that suggest that it may be more effective than conventional methods for treating older adults with type 2 disease. These studies include the use of telemedicine to improve glucose control in older people with diabetes. A recent study suggests that elderly patients have greater test specific and domain-sensitive declines than those without any prior history of heart failure. This study also uses hypergycemic drugs as an intervention against type 2, which is associated with increased frailtiness."
30380802,"This is a first-in-man study of the effects of exercise on weight loss in overweight adults. It compares resistance training to aerobic training for weight reduction. The results are similar: body mass index, fat mass, and circulating phosphorus concentrations are reduced after long-term change in diet or exercise. Type 2 Diabetes is an age related chronic disease associated by metabolic dysregulation, chronic inflammation,and activation of periphery blood mononoclear cells. In this study, we examine the effect of two different types of exercises on inflammatory markers in type 2 diabetes patients. One group has fewer leptines than the other, but both groups have significant improvements in their blood pressure, total cholesterol, health, etc. Adipokines are also reduced in the intervention group; however, they do not alter leprotin levels as much as the control group does. These studies suggest that lifestyle changes may be effective in reducing the risk of developing Type 2, Type 1, and Type 3 complications."
26167669,"This paper describes a study in which the effects of diet and prava statin on patients with high risk for heart disease were investigated. The results showed that there was no significant difference in mean baseline blood pressure levels or variation in total cholesterol during the 5- year period between the two groups. In this study, we examined the effect of combination treatment with Xiezhikang capsulesule,,xzk, and Valsaran on left-ventricular hyperthorny and heart rate disturbance in hypertensesive patients who were not conventionally considered dyslipidaemia. We performed an exploration of the benefit of combined therapy to prevent cardiovascular events in individuals with mild hypercholesteremia or without traditional hyperlipidemia; these patients formed the primary prevention group of adult Japanese patients. No studies have evaluated benefits of cholesterol lowering in theprimary prevention of chest disease in hypotensive patient who are not normally deemed ""dyphilaemic."" A Chinese red yeast rice supplement has been used to treat hypertension but is not shown to be effective in treating it. Although some studies suggest that using such drugs may reduce blood tension in people with hyperstensives, none have been published. These include one where the subjects were treated with simvastapin 20mg/dl or pratistatin 40mm. After six months, they were divided into three groups: 1) those with normal lipoprotein concentrations 105 to 190mmol/DL; 2)Those with low density lipOprotein cholesterol levels 115 to 200m Mol/DL; and finally 3) those having uncontrolled or control BP. Both groups had different values of bp at week 8 and 9, respectively. Some studies suggested reductions by statmins in patients suffering from hypertention. However, few studies found any evidence of antihypertinesic effects in either type of patient. Our aim here is to evaluate whether statiss can improve blood flow control as well as other measures of endotolhelial function in both left ventricles and right vasodes in healthy subjects. Two hundred and 50-four patients aged 45 to 80 years old were assigned either placebo or 1200 mg per day. They were then divided according to their age, gender, pre-treated cholesterolemia, etc. Their main outcome measures were measured before and after changes in lipid level. As secondary outcomes, Chlorothiagide 25"
21336493,"In this paper, we describe a patient education and reminder program to improve the care of patients at risk of osteoporrosis. We compare the results of two intervention groups: 1) physicians' only intervention; 2) an individualized 10 year Osteoprasis-choice trial; and 3) mailed reminder for older adults with fractures. This study is designed to assess the efficacy of an individualized 10-year Osteoporis-Choice program in improving the quality of care for elderly women who have been at-risk for hip fracture. The primary endpoint was bone mineral dentition test or bisphosphonates. A mixed-effects group received either treatment or usual care. After six months, they were reassessed on the following day."
19228241,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effect of constrained-induced motion therapy on patients with a first acute stroke. He compares two different approaches to treating patients who have severe arm impairments: one that involves rigid trunk movements and another that requires physical restrainting. Anderson concludes by describing an open observational survey of patient activity in stroke centers. The purpose is to determine whether or not there are any differences in functional outcome between rehabilitation team members and stroke patients. A task-oriented exercise program improves balance function in people with chronic stroke but does not improve motor function. This study uses multiple case-series to evaluate the efficiacy of reimbusable mCit treatment for subjects with mild-to-meditated strokes. After stroke, many European countries do not provide adequate care for their patients; however, some studies attempt to use evidence from individual patient trials to predict how effective these treatments will be."
30359452,"The ESCEHRA atrial fibrillation ablation long-term registry is an attempt to provide an accurate picture and efficacious outcome of cryo balloon abration in patients with chronic, drug-refused paroxysmal atrium fibrillation. In this study, we compare the performance of two different types of catheter ablaters for treating acutely recurrent paroxismal atary fibrilation: cryomembryboson or point-bypoint radiofrequency. Our primary endpoint is freedom from arrhythmian tachiarpathy after a three-month blanking interval. This study also focuses on the safety and effect of second-generation crying balloon technology on treatment of persistent paraoxynsical atry fibrils."
31039170,"In this study, we examine the effect that a high-dose of vitamin D on swimming performance in dreary-aged young swimmers is associated with improved physical performance. We conclude that it is hypothesizes that vitaminD deficiencies may lead to poor performance and that there are few controlled trials designed to test this association. A double blind, randomized trial was conducted in Switzerland, Swigerl and &#8216'. The results were as follows: Athletic performance at several speed, armgrip strength, and one legged balance were measured before or after supplementation; Age-ad adjusted changes in performancevariably during the studies were comparedbetween groups. Vitamin D has been shown to lower physical function in athletes, but no other studies have examined this relationship. This study compares the effects of daily doses of 1,500 IU of blood from two different groups of older women who are at high risk for falls and fracture. These patients receive 1,000 ug./day of cholesciferol over three years. There is little difference in the rate of change in Hba1c, C-React Protein, body mass, weight reduction, insulinsensitivity, bone dentition, depression scores, among other endpoints. Most systematic reviews rely upon the assessment of methodological quality of individual trials. However, most systematic review focuses on the reliability of evidence obtained by using the Physician's Evidence Data base."
32383066,"In this paper, we examine the effect of high-protein dairy diets on bone mineral denition in a cohort of postmenopalausal women. The results suggest that low-calium diet may be associated with increased risk of fracture. We also investigate the effects of probiotics and other dietary changes on bones. This study is an observational study designed to assess the association between calcium consumption and bone loss among older Caucasians."
25209137,"Proton Pump Inhibitors increase Osteophosis fracture risk via hypocholichydria. The effect of protin pump inhibitors on bone mineral density is compared in this study. All patients with any fracture were treated with either proton pump inhibits or histamineH2 antagonists. There was an association between the use of these two drugs for hip fracture. A large Canadian population was studied over 10, years to see whether protopi use increases the risk of breaking a hip. We found that an increased risk had been associated with long-term use PPIs, but not with other known risk factors."
27810345,"In this paper, we report the results of a large population study on the association between psyched adults and mental health. After  adjusting for sociodemography, other drugs use, and childhood depression,we find no significant associations among lifetime use of ""psychelecs"" or any increase in past year's serious psychological distress,mental health treatment, suicidasal thoughts, suicide attempt, depressionand anxiety. We conclude that there is no evidence to link psycelic use to mental illness. A double- blinde trial was conducted to investigate safety and efficacity of LSD as an antidepressant in 12 patients who had anxiety associated with death. The subjects received either 200mg/gr.g of lethal doses of drug-free therapy or 200 mg/kg of placebo. At the two month follow-up, positive trends are found via the state-trait Anxiness Inventory; p = 1. This effect size is similar to that observed in other studies. Abstaineers score significantly higher on measures of self-assessment of abstinatement. Although hypnotism has been used in healing rituals, little knowledge about how it works in the brain remains unexplored"
30234085,"In this paper, we examine whether exercise can improve executive function in older adults who are sitting for long periods of time. We conclude that exercise may be more beneficial for those who have lower or higher levels of working memory than others. This suggests that acute exercises may benefit healthy adults with low-levels of brain health. A large sample of older adult subjects has been collected from the United Kingdom Biobank and is compared to 502,641 patients aged 65.4 years old. The results suggest that vigorous physical activity may improve both executive functions and short term memory. Furthermore, studies have shown that sitting at work for prolonged periods increases the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Although there is some evidence that siting at rest reduces these risk factors, little is known about the effect of standing up during such long hours."
24129841,"In this paper, the first double blinded placebo controlled trial of an antipsychotic is being performed in patients with new diagnoses for ""a putative Prodromal Syndrome"". The aim of the study is to prevent early onset of symptoms and to palliate ongoing symptomaticatology. A recent study suggests that message-like words from meanless noise may lead to schizophreniaspectrum disorders. This risk factor leads to conversion to a medication-free condition when compared to long speech illusions during drug free intervals but does not occur during treatment with either substance. Two other studies suggest that intercession has some effect on the outcome of children with mental illness. These studies are described in more detail. Children and adolescents with unmodified diagnostic and  statistical manual of mental disorders were randomed to receive twelve weeks of open label, flexible dosed treatment or perphenazie; 8 to 32mg per day was included after it was approved by the food and drug administration. Thirty young children and adults who met DPM-IV's criteria for schizofetic disorder were assigned to receiving either reisperidonine or clozepine. After 12 weeks, subjects were divided into two groups: one group received robbery at random times; the other group went through usual dosing until they reached their desired level of improvement. They were then given six week treatments of ziprasidine, lanzapinen, or halopridol. Their efficacy was measured using the brief psychiastic rating scale as well as the ClinicalGlobal Impression scale. Results showed significant improvement in the short term effects of olibane over haloperidone. Conclusions This report indicates that there is no association between using Un published scales in medical trials and discovering significant results."
22861822,"In this study, we examine the effect of vigorous exercise on smoking-related symptoms in a crossover design. On separate days regular smokes undertook fifteen minutes of moderate intensity activity or passive seating after 15 hours of tobacco abtinence. Urges are strongest 1 day later quitting and decrease at each subsequent measure point. Rationality Substances such as nicotine are associated with increased activation withinthe mesocraticolimbically brain system ; if these were not sufficient, they could lead to relapsing after quipping. Acute aerobic exercise is shown to reduce smoking cravings but does not improve regional brain activations. This study uses functional magnetic resonance image technology to assess the effects of short bouts of intense exercise upon smoking behavior. The results suggest that exercise may be an effective strategy for reducing cigarette craving during temporary abstainance."
26383615,"Bladder is the fourth of the most common cancers among European men. Once suspected, a surgical radical cystectomy results in an ulnaremy. The place and care required impact the patient's life. Preoperative education has been shown to improve postoperative outcome for patients with bladdercancer. This study compares preoperative teaching with conventional post-elective colorecuttal surgery. In this study, we examine the effect of abstinencing from alcohol on early postophrine consumption in patients who are not drinking at least 60g ethanol per day. We also investigate whether norepination can be used as analgesis during major abdominal surgery because it reduces blood loss. A new technique for relieving pain after open radical Cymbeline surgery is described. It uses transversus ab Dominis plane blocks as compared to other methods for treating pain. Urinary diversion is another option for improving wound healing."
25370201,"This paper focuses on the effects of an intervention in school-based children's diet and physical activity on health knowledge, preferences, and fitness. The results indicate that the intervention is associated with greater increases in nutrition knowledgeand preferences; physical exercise knowledge and preferences -- and improvement in fit. A multi-dimensional lifestyle intervention was studied in a large number of low-society pre-school children. In this study, overweight and obesity were found to be significantly reduced among the control subjects. Furthermore, there was significant increase in both body massindex changes and food knowledge as well as improvements in physical activities. To further examine the effect of ""a multidimensional life intervention"" on aerobic fitness for migrant children, we performed cluster-retesting over one year. Children were divided into three groups: 1) healthy boys and girls who were age 6 or 8 years; 2) normal-weight children who had been followed from the European youth heart study; and 3) non-pregnant children aged between 3 and 6 years. Pregnative children were selected according to their height, weight, skin color, etc. They were then tested on different measures of strength and endurance. Their scores were calculated by using grip spans."
19160253,"In this paper, the authors present a seven-iet Panic Disorder severity scale to assess patients with DSMIII-R symptoms of panic disorder. The results indicate that first-time medication use, severity of an agorahphobic disability, and longer time of illness predict less improvement at posttreatment. Predicators of poorer outcomes at six months were older age, past historys of depression, severe phobia targets,and longer duration of disease. Cognitive therapy is more cost effective than usual treatment for panic disorders. A patient self-study module is created to allow patients to track their progress in real time. Forty three patients are assigned to full CT, brief CT or waitlist control. This study examines the prevalence of panic disorder with nor without agonaphobia in the Swedish population. It was found that women had 5.6 times greater predominance among women than men. Brain Snack: ""Panic was not valuable outcome measure"". We examined 113 reports from 1980 in which we rated nearly all new treatments as improvements over old ones. For example, studies suggest that innovation may be better than st or ard therapy. However, when it comes to long-term efficacy, physicians recommend that patients should be treated for at least one year."
18838001,"Carpal tunnel Syndrome is a painful, nagging, and sometimes fatal disease of the neck and shoulders that affects an increasing number of people in the United States. Although high rates of Cts in certain professions have been described, little has been done to estimate its prevalence among the general population. This study focuses on the association between upper-limb symptoms and use of hand-held devices."
30463844,"The effect of walking on blood glucose concentrations in overweight patients is compared. Walking improves the control of insulin secretioon by 34 percent and 25 p.m., while walking increases the amount of time taken to complete the exercise trial. Fructose has been proposed as a potential risk factor for non-alcoholicfatty liver disease but little is known about its effects on this disease. A double blinded placebo-controlled study compares two diets: one with high fructoses or another with low-fructese. Both groups have similar results regarding body weight, fat mass, and lipid levels. In addition, they show no significant differences between fasting and Postprar and Insulin binding; however, both groups consume higher amounts of sugar than usual. This study investigates whether family dietary counseling will improve health in free- living children and parents. It was found that families were assigned to groupA, advised to lower fat and increase complex carbogenic intake, or groupB, instructed to reduce bothfat and sugar and increased complex carbohydrates. After eight weeks, these subjects consumed either regular sugar/sugar reduced foods or artificial sweetened beverages. These subjects were divided into four groups according to their height and weight. They were given three different types of food at each meal: 1) ""wild greens pie"" 2) ""chicken burgers,"" 3) ""vegetable mousaka"" 4) and ""anoral glucose load."" Their main outcome was change in body size. Although fruit consumption had an adverse effect on body composition, it was not yet clear whether fruits could be used as prebiotics against Type 2 diabetes."
23074516,"In this paper, we describe the results of a study in which patients are assigned either to self-maintenance or conventional management. The aim is to determine whether there is any difference in the quality of control of both methods. Ninetiety two patients were assigned to either Self-management of Oral Anticoagulation Therapy or Convention Management. This study was designed to compare the safety andefficacy of selfmanaged treatment with that of conventional care. It was found that patients who received long-term anticoagulating therapy had better control over their blood samples than those who did not receive it. A point of care testing trial was conducted in Belgium to assess the effectiveness of point-of-care testing as an aid in managing chronic conditions. There were no studies on how well self managed regimens could be used for improving patient health. Although many physicians practiced routine medicine, few studies have been performed on elderly patients receiving long term warfarin. These studies included several different groups of patients. One group consisted of older patients with major bleeding complications; the second group comprised younger patients without significant bleeding problems. Finally, the third group consisting of young patients aged 60 or 80 years old with at least 1 month of war farin before enrollment. They were divided into four groups: 1) self managers, 2) routine care groups, 3) intervention practices, and 4) general practitioners. Each group received education about antithrombopoism files and patient instructions. Furthermore, each group took part in one of the Point of Care Trials described in Chapter 1, Section 2 -- ""PoCT"" -- whereby all three groups received training on various aspects of disease management from primary care doctors. Another study examined the effect of physician-patient selfmonitoring on the efficability of OAC therapy when compared to standard medical care within the United States. Both groups showed marked improvement in mean quality adjusted life years after follow-up. Other studies suggested that patient self maintenance may improve the performance of anticlosion therapy by using more frequent blood tests. However, these studies were only carried out in specialized centers rather than in family physicians' offices. Many patients required frequent laboratory checks to ensure that they were getting the right amount of medication. Most patients needed frequent lab checks because they often experienced severe bleeding events. Physicians need to know what intensity of prothromino time should be maintained to prevent serious complications. Therefore, most patients do not get adequate doses of Warfar"
30293134,"The Swiss multi-centre bypass or sleeves study, which involved 3971 patients who were morbidly overweight, was performed from January 2000 until November 2011 and included 217 patients assigned to either laparose adjustable gastric bash or Rouxen-Y Gastric bypass. This study compares long-term weight loss and complications in the two groups of patients. In the first group, there was no significant change in weight after surgery; in contrast, in both groups, it was not sufficient for long term improvement. After 14 years of follow-up, the rate of complications increased dramatically. Although many studies have reported that weight reduction has been associated with improved health, few have examined this effect on mortality. These studies are limited because of insurance and lack of access to care."
28253049,"This study focuses on the association between reduced executive function and risk of falls in older adults. It is a prospective, cross-sectional study that follows 256 communitydwelling elderly adults for 5 years to determine whether single or dual task walking ability are associated with increased fall risk. In this study, we describe the effects of an eight-month music-based exercise program on gait speed as well as the predictors of future falls. We also examine the effect of age-related physical changes on walk speed and Stride Length in healthy older people. A new balance group training program has been shown to reduce fear of falling by improving step execution and gaitting in these patients. The results suggest that there may be some relationship between measures of foot position and subsequent falls among those who have fallen."
28466180,"A prospective, randomed, doubleblind, multicentre trial was performed on the efficiacy of two antimicrobial regimens for both abdominal andvaginal hemysterectomy. The results were not significant; however, there were significant differences between the incidence of infection, need for post-operative antibiotics, or duration of post surgical hospitalization. In contrast, patients receiving cefo taxime had a greater risk of complications than those receiving clindasmycin plus anecdote. This study is designed to determine whether prophylactic therapy with nitro furantoin after pelvic arm prolapse and/or Ury tract infection reduces urinary Tract infection in patients after abdominal haggard surgery. It was found that this treatment resulted in improved patient safety and satisfaction."
26498716,"In this study, we describe the efficacy and safety of two different ablation strategies for long-term control of atrium fibrillation. The first is a pulsive vein isolation procedure with left lesions in the pulmonary vein; the second is an AAD that involves obliterating the lesion by ballooning it into the blood vessel. After three years, the patients are free from atrial fibrillation without any drugs. This study compares the success of both methods in terms of quality of life. For example, after one year's follow-up, only 46 patients were free to return to their normal state. At the end of the trial, there was no significant difference in overall outcome between the two approaches."
26920333,"Blood pressure control has been shown to be effective in preventing heart attack among patients with low blood pressure, but there is little evidence that this can be accomplished. The European Society for Hypertension-chinese hypertension league Stroke InhypertensionOptimal Treatment trials are designed to compare three different blood flow goals: 1) two LDL-c targets; and 2) two different target levels of low-diatolic cholesterol. These studies aim to reduce the risk by reducing the level of high-DiAst/Clopidity as well as by improving the quality of life of those who have had a recent cardiovascular event. Although these results do not seem to improve the overall health of the patient, they may lead to increased risk of death from stroke or other cardiovascular events. A prospective cohort study of 7,500 patients aged between 65 and 89 years was conducted on 1757 patients including 17, 536 African Americans, 12, 618 whites. This population included 1,500 people in Europe, 5,000 in China, and 7500 men and women age at least sixty years old. Antihyptertensive treatments were studied in older patients under 70 years' age. Diabetes mellitateus is an important risk factor for coronary heart diseases. We investigated effects of antihypersive drugs on acute myocaral infacultation. Two large trial designs were performed regarding the effect of active antihypertensesive therapy on the frequencyof fatal and non fatal stroke and Myocardial Ion and other Cardiodevalic deaths in elderly patients without previous cardiovascular disease. Both groups showed significant reductions in the rate of major cardiovascular complications. However, neither group reported any improvement in their GFR. They also did not report any change in either the number of patients receiving treatment or the duration of follow up."
32054469,"In this paper, we describe the effects of cycled light on preterm infant health and development. Preterm babies are randomed to either early or late-cycling light at 28 weeks gestation. The results suggest that extremely preterminous infants receive better health outcomes than prematurely birthed children who receive conventional care. We also examine the effect of infant massage on growth and motor development in very prematurous newborns. A prospective, cross-sectional study is performed to evaluate the association between maternal and child-infancy care and medical conditions during the first three years of life. After a period of follow-up, all patients were assigned to an open room with no other adults. This study was designed to compare the benefits of different types of intervention for different kinds of brain problems. For example, there was evidence suggesting that Nidcap's program improved sleep-wakening pattern, behavior, and neurodebratory outcome. However, these studies did not show any significant changes in overall health or mental health."
28785154,"This study focuses on the effects of three different drugs on patients with no alcoholic fatty liver: metformin, silyshell, and piogliltazone. The first group is treated by piolitizen 15mg/d, second by met formin 500mG/D, third by sillymarin 140mMg daily. In this paper, we examine the effect that these three drugs have on non-alcoholic fat liver disease. For example, in one patient who loses his weight after eating a very low-calorie diet, hepatotic changes are seen. Liver Biochemistry was not of any value to him. He concludes that ""liver biochemistry,"" which was of little individual value, improved. Although there has been no single intervention for treating such diseases, it is believed that they can be used alone or together. Silymir plus vitamin E improves liver function in patients without alcoholism."
31858251,"This paper focuses on the efficacy of mirtzapine in treating patients with pain, nausea, vomiting, appetite loss, and anxiety. It is a prospective, open label study that aims to determine the importance of changes on an 11-point pain intensity numerical rating scale for patients who have been treated with conventional treatment. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of imipramine and Mirtazapini on not only distressing symptoms but also depressed and anxious symptoms. In this paper, we examine the reliability of the Patient health Question naire Anti-Depressant and Anxiety Measures as well as the generalized depression and anxieties scale. We conclude that these measures are highly reliable and can be used as predictors of patient satisfaction. Major depressive illness is common and debilityating in many patients; however, there is limited evidence against the use of drugs in these patients. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the potential of an antidopamine clinical trial in advanced disease such as malignant chest disease."
27889922,"In this study, we examine the influence of psychopathy on aggressive behavior in patients with chronic schizophrenia. We compared the Positive and negative Syndrome Scale to the Clinical Global Implications scale for assessing severity of illness. The results indicate that olanzepine, riperidone or haploridol are superior to conventional antipsychotic treatments in improving neurocognition in treatment-refracted patients. Brain Snack: Many studies have suggested that an association between use of untested scales in medical trials may lead to increased risk of adverse effects from these tests."
25409878,"In this study, we examine the effects of statins on patients with high-sensitivity c-reactiveprotein levels. We conclude that people with low-disease lipoprotein and high blood pressure may benefit from treatment. The results of the trial are not favorable. After a mean follow-up period of 4.9 years, rosuvalstatin reduces LDL cholesterol by 50 %) and C-Reactive Protein levels by 37 percent. This study is an attempt to assess the efficacy for pravastain in post-myocardial myopaternal events. Costeffectiveness analysis was performed using actual clinical, cost, and health related quality-of- life data from the Care trial. Results showed that it was more cost effective for patients older than 60 years of Age and for those with pretreatment Low Density Lipophospholipid levels greater than 125mg/dl."
30286928,"Arterial distentsibility measures are widely used, but little knowledge of relationship to patient outcome is gained. In this study, we examine whether the aorttic pulse wave velocity predicts all-caluse mortality in Type 2 patients with diabetes and glucose tolerance. The results indicate that subjects with type 2 have greater blood pressures than controls. Aortic Pulwv values were greater in subjects who had type 1 diabetes than control subjects. There are limited details about the presentation characteristics, management, and outcomes for patients without dyphoid or other chronic disease. Although there are many studies on acute coronary events, only one has been published. This study describes the effects of salveolozin as an anti-hypertensive agent in type1 diabetes. It was hypothesized by our group that empaglifilozi would also reduce hypertension and improve markers of sympathetic nerve system activity. Blood pressure, arterial stiffnes, heart rate Variability and circulating signs of aldosteron mediators were calculated during clampeded euplycaemia. After 8 weeks of Emagluflolizin, empaviflazin reduced blood flow and Hba1c in patients treated with Type 1 mellitis. These patients were divided into three groups: those with normal blood sugar levels; those not having any self-rescribed diabetes; and those suffering from unstable myomyocardial arches. We collected information from six different countries regarding the prognosies of patients after their admission to the emergency department. They reported that these patients had higher rates of catheterizing and surgery than non-diabitotic patients. Social policy can spread through social ties. By reaching influential individuals, health interventions that harness the distributed properties of social réseaux could be made most effective and efficient"
9678145,"The literature is divided as to whether an appendectomy performed in the presence of a trauma or for other disease states does not significantly improve patient morbidness or mortality. A chart surveys of all appendedicitis, including acute appeniciitis and incidental procedures, performed on the Trauma Service of Grady Medical Hospital over 40 months appear to indicate that wound infection rate was the same; however, the Intraabumbinal Sepsis Rate was greater than for more advanced perforative or gangrennous appedicites. In this study, we examine the effect of an accidental appentectomy on safety of both choleciastectomy-only and laparomy in patients under age 50 years. Both groups are well matched with age, sexe, obesity, and lengthof hospital stay."
24197622,"In this follow-up of seven patients with spinal cord injured who completed supervised exercise trials, the results showed that they had greater satisfaction with their lives and were less stressed and pained than a control group. After the study ended, however, they did not report any changes in their quality of life. This was followed by another study on the effect of exercise training on people with spine cord injury. The results indicated that there was no change in body fat or vital capacity after the exercise program. However, it was suggested that some pragmatic approaches might be used to improve the efficacy of physical training for people suffering from spinal Cord injury"
10796569,"In this paper, we examine the effect of vitaminC on colds. We find that it does not reduce the duration or severity of cold episodes in any way; however, there is a significant reduction in the frequency of symptoms. A double blinded trial was performed to determine whether ascorbicacide would reduce upper-respitorytract infection after participation in an extreme marathon. The results showed that daily doses were more effective than placebo in reducing the number of patients who developed cold illnesses. This study also found that ascobic acid did not improve the severity and duration of common cold outbreaks but reduced the incidence of illness by nearly twofold. Furthermore, both groups experienced less time of sickness than those receiving placebo. Another doubleblind test was conducted to evaluate the effects of large dosages of Vitamin C on the risk of gastric colon disease. It was concluded that these small amounts could be used as prophylactic measures against such conditions."

In this study, we examine the effects of two different drugs on lipoproteins: atorvastain 20mg/day and bezafiebrate 200md daily. The results show that both are effective at reducing LDL cholesterol but not at improving HDL or trigllyceride levels. We also investigate the role of gemfibro Zilfil as an anti-hyperlipidic agent."
30350850,"This study focuses on the effects of ""sit-stand and workstation"" on sitting time, neck pain, and other health problems. It is a cluster-random trial that includes four Dutch companies, an airline Company, &#8216a steel company', as well their university medical hospital. The results show that this program reduces sitting times by up to eight weeks. In addition, it prevents low back pain from reaching the point of injury in one year. Neck pain also occurs frequently among office workers. A recent study suggests that siting at work can be beneficial for both physical and mental health. Furthermore, studies have shown that rest breaks are effective in preventing neck injuries. Another study examines the effect of walking with support on upper arm pain. This paper reports that walkers who spend most of their time working indoors tend to suffer more than those who do not work outdoors. Walking with supports has been shown to improve symptoms of lower-extremity shoulder pain; however, there is little evidence of its efficacy."
30547275,"Ulcerativecolitis is associated with poor quality of life, work-related outcome, and disease activity. This study focuses on the effects of treatment on patients with moderate or severe colitis. The results suggest that analgesics may be effective in treating mild to moderately ulcerative Colitis; however, few studies have examined changes in health-regarding quality measures. In this study, we examine the effect of delayed- release mesalamib on efficacy in patients suffering from moderate to severe U.C. by comparing the severity of each measure to a mean change in the patient's response to treatment. We conclude that there is little difference between the magnitude of changes measured by the short-form health survey and the generalized version of the instrument. A multicentre, prospectiove, single arm study assesses the effectiveness of maintenance treatment after improvement in symptoms following eight weeks of therapy. At Week 26, 67 p.m. percent were in complete recovery. Crohn s disease is characterized by predictable flaresand debilitates symptoms such as nausea, abdominal pain, fever, which can intercede with one patient ""s ability to perform daily activities."" These symptoms can interfere with working and performance."

We find that smoking increases the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes but does not increase the rate of Type 3 disease. Furthermore, there is no clear relationship between weight-discrimination and ""allostatic load"" in humans."
32357844,"This paper describes a novel approach to stroke care that uses interdisciplinary approaches to improve patient outcomes. It involves the use of an advanced-practice nurse-led intervention, called ICARUS, to promote improved risk-factor control in stroke patients. The aim of this study is to determine whether an individualized treatment program can reduce absolute blood pressure in patients with acute stroke. In this trial, we examine the effects of lifestyle and exercise intervention on health behavior after transient is Chaemic attack. We conclude that ""Enhanced secondary prevention"" may be more effective than conventional stroke secondary preventative care for patients who have mild or no new venous attacks."
20559827,"This study focuses on the efficacy and safety of a new minimally-incisioned approach for total hiparthroplasty. It compares the results of two different surgical approaches: 1) anteroward, or 2) direct angular approach. The primary aim of this trial is to determine whether there are any differences in component positioning between the two group of surgeons. Aim To evaluate post-operatory walking ability after six months; as well as pre-operative laboratory results."
31119649,"Context The present trial is a safety-and-dose finding study for weekly doses of MOD4023 in children with growth-hormone deficiencies. In this study, we evaluate the safety and tolerability of three different daily dosages -- compared with regular human GH -- as well as an efficacious regimen of Transcon Growth Hormonie, which has been shown to be more effective than daily rheuminant hGH in patients with GHD. We conclude that it is possible to use two different forms of gh: one that is given once-a week and another that can be used for up to twelve months. This study was designed to assess the efficacity and safety of both regimens. It was concluded that the first regimen required daily dosing, while the second regimen would require frequent daily Dosage. A novel sustained-resume gondroitin formulation called lb03002 was developed to treat long-term opportune patients who were not on stable daily treatment."

No indications that either was beneficial for pain relief, but we conclude that it should not be performed routinely. The number and severity of analggesic medication needed was no greater in patients without pre-operative treatment. This study is designed to evaluate the effect of ""facia iliaca"" compartment block on hip surgery patients at intermediate or higher risk for developing acute delirium. In this study, all patients are divided according to their risk of developing such complication. All patients receive balanced analsisia and nurse-controlled AnalgesiA with Morine. Pre-Optractive complications include: length of stay, and one year's mortality. To compare the effects of spinal anesthesia as an alternative to conventional anaesthesia after hip fracture, two prospective studies were carried out. First, there was evidence that using morphine instead of plain levobuvacaine reduces the need for generalanesthesia; second, more than half of the patients received spine anesis alone. Finally, another study was conducted regarding the use of pulsed nerve stimulator to improve pain control in elderly patients who had been undergoing hip injuries. It was found that the frequency of pain scores did not vary significantly between groups. Furthermore, the peak pain score differed from the average pain Score in each group."
31598135,"In this study, we aim to determine the effect of prebiotic and probiotic on blood glycemia in patients with no alcohol disease. We divided the patients into four groups: control group, routine treatment group; combined treatment-A, B andC. Each group has equal patients. The duration was 1 month. laboratory parameters were evaluated prior treatment and thrtieth days after treatment, including cholesterol, TC / TG, high density lipoproteincholestic cholesterol dl-C a, low dentin lipometry cholesterol LDL-D. Alanine amino transferasese AST... fasting bloodglucose FPG.... Serum highmolecular weight aponectin HMW-APSN."" Probiotics may have benefits on nonalcoholic fat liver disease, but only r and Omized controlled trials are available. This study is designed to assess the beneficial effects of probiota on hepatic fibrositis, liver proteges, and inflammation markers in subjects with NAFL. It was performed in 60 patients aged 25-64 years old. After 8 weeks, they were assigned to receive either an alpha-Tocopherol or two  105 CFU/G symodic supplement for 28 weeks. They were instructed to follow an energetic balance of diet and activity recommendations. These studies were conducted in sixty patients who had been treated with metformin as well as placebo. Their anthropometric values, SBP, diastoplic blood pressure, malondial dehyde, MDA, Nitric oxide, TNF, were assessed at base and after eight weeks of intervention."
25351783,"This paper focuses on the relationship between physical activity and weight in young children. It uses a novel experiment to examine how eating cheeseburgers affects behavior in children who are not physically active. In this study, all children work for food while watching television. Children do not receive any dishabbituating stimulus; instead, they receive ""novel food"" or ""french fries"" as snacking stimuli. The results of the experiment indicate that children's diet is associated with improved health. Although there is no direct association between sitting time and death, it is possible that these behaviors may lead to premature mortality. A cross sectional survey was carried out among eight school-going girls in Delhi during the year 2006 to assess the frequency of daily breakfast consumption among them. There were 1816 deaths from cardiovascular disease and 547 from type 2 diabetes during follow-up."
25074070,"Nuts may reduce blood pressure and improve the risk of heart disease. In this study, nine healthy volunteers were randally fed with three test meals and two white bread control meal on separate days. The effect of adding nuts to one meal was studied in relation to postpor and iaed events. Nutes reduced both total and lipoproprotein concentrations; however, they increased both cholesterol levels. Frequent eating nuts may lower risks of cardiovascular disease because they increase energy from fat. This study compares the effects of two amounts of almond consumption with those of an American Cholsterol Education program Step I diet: 1) a very low-stained fat diet, 2) the same diet Plus 20mg lovastain, 3) eat high in plant fibers, soy milk, and sory burgers. Almond is also shown to lower LDLcholesterol by 0.32 Mmol/L for men and women who are not hyperlipidic. A comparison between these two diets showed that coconuts have been found to be more effective at lowering serum lipid content than statins or other anti-cholestrol foods. However, there is little evidence regarding their efficacy in treating patients with Type 2 diabetes."
22923430,"This study focuses on the use of gait-sitting technology to predict whether older adults with ""frilty"" are likely to be at risk for sudden strokes. It is based on a prospective cohort study of fifty patients with mild to moderate frailties who have not yet experienced relapses of their symptoms. The goal of this study is to determine whether or not gaits speed predicts the severity of an acute stroke."
26210195,"In this study, we report the effect of statins on plaque volume in patients with acute coronary disease. We compared the effects of early staton treatment on lesion volume and blood levels after an acute chest artery block. The results suggest that gastric bypass may be more effective than other methods for resolving Type 2 diabetes. This paper also reports on changes in gut hormonal response after gastroplasty. It is reported that there is a significant increase in plasma biliary acid concentration after Rouxen-Y Gastric Bypass."
25359355,"This study focuses on the effect of cycle training on patients with chronic lung disease. It uses a six-min walk test, an incremental walking test that is used to assess performance in people with severe obstrutive pulmonary disease, as well as other tests. The results suggest that exercise training may improve functional capacity in older patients who have been treated for their underlying disease and are not likely to benefit from it. In this paper, we examine the effects of eight-week exercises on endurance walking distance and quality of living in patients suffering from acute thrombosis. We also discuss the use of two 6-minute walktests -- one indoor and one outdoors -- as assessment tools in treating patients without improvement in their health."
21640547,"Prostate patients receiving or rogen-deprivation treatment are vulnerable to many of the side effects that can seriously impact their quality of life. Physical activity, such as home-based exercise and resistance training, have been shown to improve physical function in men who are receiving ADT. In this study, we examine the effect on strength, postural controls, and mobility after hip fracture in newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients. We conclude that an exercise regimen will reduce the risk of disease progression and injury in these patients because it is more likely than not to be associated with reduced bone mass, increased risks for fractures, reduced leans Mass and muscle strength; mood disturbance and elevated fat mass. This study also determines whether long-term exercise may prevent fatigue during acute therapy for localized prostitutes."
30698831,"In this paper, we describe a doubleblind, placebo controlled trial of patients who have been drinking heavily for at least two weeks. The subjects receive either cannanbidiol or placebo and their effects are compared to that of the placebo group. We conclude that there is no demonstrable change in blood alcohol levels between the two groups. This study also describes an open-labeled treatment of 15 patients with alcohol dependentness. They were assigned up to 300mg/d of Topiramates or 180mG/day of placebo. Their main efficacy was self reported percentage of heavy drink days. A total of 75 patients were given topirate as an addition to weekly compliance management. Thirty patients received topriamate escalting doses of 25-2575 mg per day; 75 had placebo along with daily compliance enhancement intervention."
25995283,"In this study, we examine the effects of coconut oil, palm oil and trans-fatty acid on lipophospholipids in postmenopauseal women. The results indicate that coconut fat has a negative effect on total cholesterol but not on LDLcholesterol. This is due to its high content of alkyl fatty acids. We conclude that it is important to compare the different types of fat used in food to determine which ones have the best effects on blood chemistry."
28485385,"The purpose of this study is to identify psychological disorders and predictors after spinal injury. It focuses on patients who have been admitted to the emergency room after their injury, but it does not include patients with other injuries. This study uses a group-based intervention to improve psychological adjustment following an acute spine injury as well as those who do not experience the injury themselves. In addition, the authors examine the influence of prior trauma on posttraumatic symptoms in patients without previous trauma."
23372816,"In this study, Holter-monitoring is used to compare the effects of restrictive and liberal red blood transfusion strategies on the risk of aemia in elderly patients undergoing knee replacement surgery. The first patient consents to having whole blood collected at the operating room during the initial procedure. After two groups of consecutive patients have primary or revision hip replacements, they are studied for 11 months. Two groups receive complete blood collection with acute normogenovolimic bleeding. A case control study includes 40 patients who had total knee prostheses. Another group receives autologous transplants as well as allogeneically transfused donor blood. This study examines the effect of an open wound drainage system on postoperative blood loss. It was found that there were no significant differences in need for bankblood between the two different groups. Furthermore, the incidence of Post-Operative Ischaemia was also comparable amongst both groups; however, it was not possible to determine whether these differences were due to specific disease conditions."
29044670,"In this study, we examine the effects of short- wavelength light on eye fatigue in patients wearing clear spectacles. We find that subjects wear shorter-brightening glasses during tasks and report less pain in the eyes than do subjects wearing conventionally clear glasses."
28202095,"In this paper, Dr. Barlow focuses on the effects of vitamin B6, as well as folate and other nutrients on patients with schizophrenia. He uses a prospective, open-label study to determine whether adding two milligs of folilic acid or one hundred mg of Vitamin B12 can reduce negative symptoms in patients who are suffering from schizophrenia either alone or in combination with other antipsychotic drugs. The results indicate that both groups have significant reductions in their symptoms. Furthermore, barlow concludes that more effective treatments for these conditions are needed than they are currently available."
30540028,"In this paper, we describe a prospective study of the use of short-term predictors of violence in patients with acute idiatric conditions. We assess the risk of physical Restraints in three Psychiatic emergency rooms in Brazil. The results suggest that younger people are at greater risk for physical restraintals than older, less aggressive or violent people. This is an important issue in the prehospital medical system and no studies have been performed regarding the incidence nor effects of training on diagnosis and therapeutic accuracy. However, there has been no evidence of any effect of education on diagnoses and treatment. Acute psychiatrical situations are of importance to the Germany pre hospital physician-based crisis care system. No further studies exist about the frequency of these situations. Physicians attend stands during their daily supervision. Two emergency physicians attend two different types of educational classes: one attended by nurses and seven doctors; the other attended only by nurse and doctor. Both groups rate each patient equally using the same assessment scale. They also compare the severity of anxiety and agitation as measured by the Short-Term Predictiveness Assessment tool. These measures were used to evaluate the efficacy of various drugs for treating patients who had severe mental disturbances. All medications produce calming effects within one hour but only haloperidal plus midasolam reduces aggression by more than four points after the first hour. Adverse reactions to medication are not studied in this study. Most patients are males single, with low educational level, professionally inactivated and living with families. Agitations are frequently observed in bothpatient and outpatient settings. There are no reliable instruments to measure such behavior."
25636811,"In this study, we examine the effects of a single 1,25-dihydroxycholecaliferol dose on glucose tolerance in patients with chronic hemodylysis. The dialysis subjects were compared with healthy controls and showed improved endogenous secretion after two hours of treatment. This was an important finding because it revealed that both groups were highly sensitive to insulin secretions during the clamp studies. Context This study is related to other studies which have examined the effect of paricalcitriol on left valereity. It has been reported that paricitol can be used to treat hypertonic uremia but there is no concluding evidence for its efficacy."
30557311,"In this study, we examine the predictors of intense lowback pain and sick leaves in Norwegian nurses' aides. We find that these factors are associated with intense back pain during the first three months of the observation period, as well as with perceived lack of superiority and pleasant work culture in the nursing unit. A further analysis is performed on the association between psychological and social factors in workers with mild to moderate low back discomfort. The results suggest that patients frequently sit in bed, have frequent postures, feel lacking support from immediately superior, and feel ""loathed and relaxing culture"" in their work unit"
29212370,"This paper describes the effects of Type A therapy on patients with depression. It is a mixed-effects study, divided into two groups: 1) group therapy for patients who have low social support; and 2) group counseling for those who do not have high social supports. The results are similar in terms of mortality and morbidities. In addition, there is no difference in the survival of patients assigned to either group treatment or usual care after their first myomyocardially infa ""rct"" ion. There is little evidence that exercise training improves blood pressure or other risk factors following an acute MyoCare infusion. However, this trial does not increase event free survival."
17138709,"A double blind, parallel- design study is conducted on 105 healthy adult subjects who have been given a complete regimen of prophylacis and are assigned to brush twice daily with one of three dentificides. In this study, the effects of an antimicrobial fluoride mouthreinse that contains 0.3 %) triclosans in conjunction with two % of maleic acid were studied over six months. The results showed that the control group was better at inhibiting plaque formation and gumivitis than the placebo group. This study also examined the effect of coconut oil on gingivival inflammation and bleeding. It was found that coconut oils had more efficacy in reducing both diseased and non-diseased groups of patients."
20881587,"In this study, we examine the effect of two different exercise training regimens on falls and injury in older adults. We compare a fall risk reduction program to an educational control condition. The subjects were divided into two groups: 1) resistance training; 2) all round functional skills training -- or 2) no-evidenced control conditions. This study is designed to determine whether high-intentional exercise can improve quality of life, vitality, and depression among older people with serious physical and mental impairments. It was found that there was little experimental evidence for the efficiacy of these three different training methods on elderly people who live in long- term care facilities. A multi-factorial fall prevention program could reduce falls by improving balance, gait, strength, endurance, fatigue, self-reporting disability, as well as other measures of health."
26567029,"In this paper, we investigate risk factors for patients with functionally ill-characterized dyspepsesia in the context of the Rome II definition of ""functional"" and ""postpr and Ial distress syndrome."" We also examine the effects of sertraline on symptoms in patients who have been treated with it. Acute studies suggest that treatment may be effective in treating chronic somatic or gastrointestinal pain conditions, including feigned functional dysplepsis. However, long-term trials are lacking. The aim is to determine whether levosupiride, a partial agonist from the 5-H1A receptor, improves symptoms of patients suffering from functional Dypepsy. This study uses an observational survey of over 30,000 Swedish patients to assess the extent of functional disease among these patients."
28472417,"The results of a second large-scale study on the mental development of children born through assisted reproductive techniques, this time using IVF and ICSI, are presented. In this paper, we present evidence for the effects of gestation, time to pregnancy, and induction of fertilization on child development. We conclude that although there is some gender- specific differences in the outcome of these studies, they do not appear to be related to other aspects of child health or behavior when compared to controls. A systematic review has found no evidence of delays at neurocognition or sensory motor development in infants treated with donor-insemination. However, several reviews have suggested that women play an important role in child growth."
27418884,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective study on patients with unstable fractures who have been treated with volar locking plates. We compare the efficacy of two different methods for treating such distal radius injuries: percutaneous pining or external fixation. The results are similar in age, gender, dominance, and medical comorbidities. A prospective trial is performed to evaluate the outcomes after surgery of stable dorsly displaced disctalradials. Both methods improve range of motion but there is little difference in grip strength at three and six months. This paper discusses the use of patient-reported outcome measures in clinical trials regarding people with wrist Ostearthritis. It uses standardized reporting procedures to identify studies that report reliability, validity, or respondness."
31316592,"In this paper, Dr. Barlow focuses on the use of physical therapy to treat patients with shoulder injuries. He uses a prospective patient population of 26 people and 14 women who have been diagnosed with ""suacromisal impingment syndrome"" in order to determine whether or not they will be willing to undergo surgery. The results of the study are described in great detail. After three months of exercises, patients are asked whether they want surgery; after one year, they decide to do it. This is an important question because surgeons often need to wait for their patients to return from surgery so that they can perform other treatments. A few weeks later, however, some patients choose to go back to surgery as soon as possible."
31848147,"In this paper, we describe the results of a large-scale, i.e., cross-sectional study of an early intervention program for children with Autism Spectrum disorder. We found that the program did not have any significant effects on real world social communication skills; however, there were no significant differences in parent report measures after the intervention. This paper also discusses the use of ""peer-mediated"" approaches to improve communication in young children who have been identified as having an orphanage-like condition. It is reported that both approaches result in improvements in language and speech skills in children under 6 years of age. A second paper reports that using ""Camp Discovery"" to teach pre-literacy skills to children without an immediate treatment does not lead to significant changes in communicative skills."
20565960,"This study focuses on the efficaciousness of low dose fluoxenin and amitraline in treating patients with Parkinson's disease. In this study, we compare the effect of two different anti-depressant drugs, pramipexel and sertralite, on motor symptoms in patients suffering from PD. The results suggest that pramexole is more effective than other treatments for improving motor function in these patients. We also examine the effects of a single-handed transcranial magnet stimulation on depressed patients who have idiopathic parkinsony."
28003239,"In this study, we examine the effects of head impact on postural control in a group of female college-aged youth soccer players. We hypothesize that head strikes may lead to changes in neurocognition and other features of the player's performance."
23440795,"In this paper, the authors present a new approach to primary prevention of stroke in elderly patients with low-Density Lipoprotein Cholsterol levels. They use an older age group as control subjects and compare it to that of younger patients who have high-sensitivityC-reactive Protein levels but do not have hyperlipidemia. The results suggest that statin therapy may be more effective than other anti-disease agents because it reduces the risk of major artery disease, death, and hospitalization. This is especially important for people with elevated cholesterol concentrations. A recent study showed that rosurvastatin can slow progression of caroteid inta-media thickening in Japanese patients without influencing their glyceric control. These studies are further followed by two prospective studies on the effects of diet and statmins on blood pressure."
30128767,"In this study, we examine the effects of eating a low fat, high fiber diet on bloodlipids. The rec diet results in lower concentrations of LDL and cholesterol than the Dane or Danish diet. Furthermore, the rec-diet reduced factor VII thrombolytic activity and raised plasma Fibrinolysis activity. We conclude that consuming fewer refined foods may be more effective in reducing weight than an unhealthy diet based on European standards. This paper is designed to evaluate the health effects for Danish children with the New Nordic Eater's School Meal program. It was found that school meals increased food consumption by 0 pmol/mg; however, it remains unclear whether these changes were associated with improved performance on tests of attention, learning, and mathematics."
30591077,"The Air Force's ""Weigh to Stay"" program is a proven weight-management method that has been shown to be effective in reducing body fat and improving physical fitness among overweight military men. In this study, we examine the effects of four weeks of exercise training on health-related skills and performance. Weight to stay results in improved blood lipid concentrations, increased body mass index, and improved bodyfat loss in overweight soldiers. This study compares the effectiveness of an eight-week education-based regimen with conventional exercises for combatants. It shows that subjects who adhered to their preferred eating habits were more likely to lose weight than those who followed standardized diets."
21251757,"This paper focuses on the effects of three-month physical exercise on subjects with lowback pain. It is a first attempt to use an observational longitudinal approach to assess the effect of activity on lower limb performance in subjects suffering from chronic low backpain. In this study, we aim to determine whether objective measures of free standing physical activity can predict outcome, recovery, and course of Low Back Pain. The results of this trial are as follows: 1) patients receive active physical treatment; 2) patients attend three times p.m. for 10 weeks; and 3) patients follow up at 6 months. We conclude that there is evidence that ""recovering"" of patients with acute or subacute Lb is more effective when compared with waiting list control groups. However, information about the different kinds of treatment for these patients has not been collected yet. For example, studies have shown that grade d activities are most effective in relieving pain and improving functional function. A previous study showed that fear avoidance beliefs were important for individuals with chronic back pain but only one group was fully restored. Another study found that self-management programs could be used to treat patients who had suffered from high back discomfort."
25639643,"In this paper, we describe a novel approach to detecting atrium fibrillation with continuous ECG-monitoring. We compare the use of Holter electrodes to continuous stroke unit electrocardiography for detection of paroxsmal attriotic atrial fibrilation in patients who have had an acute ischemia. This study is designed to determine whether or not long-lived Holters are more sensitive than standard transthorac echocardiographs for determining paroxysal atary fibrilsation. The results of this study indicate that it is possible to detect paroxism without using conventional methods such as streptomyemism or telemetry."
28629898,"The aim of this study is to determine the effect of a low fat diet on body weight change in patients with Type 2 diabetes. In this paper, we report that alpha lipoic acid has been shown to be effective at reducing body-mass-index changes in subjects with type 2 disease. We conclude that it may be due to an excess of free radicals and/or oxidative stresses that cause these changes. This study also examines the effects of high-fat diets on metabolic risk factors for obese patients. It was found that soy milk replaced by cow's milk reduced waist circumference but did not improve blood pressure or other measures of health."
25006974,"A case control study is designed to compare the recovery time of children after mild brain injury with that of non-injured patients. The results are compared in terms of age, gender, and physical activity. In this case, high school andcollegiate athletes were tested two days after concusions. This study uses neuropsychological testing to assess changes in brain function shortly after an acute head injury. It also examines whether symptoms associated with mild trauma are related to long- term sequelae caused by mild traumatic Brain Injury. Although no significant differences exist between group differences on pre- or post-conccussion tests, it is concluded that there is a relationship between symptoms and severity during the first weeks of recovery."
25963557,"The aim of this study is to determine the impact of delay in surgery on local control, overall survival, and disease-free response in patients with breastcancer who have undergone six consecutive institution-based trials. In these studies, patients receive a combination of trastuumab or docetaxell without chemotherapy. This study also compares the safety of two different regimens for women with early breast cancer: one that uses only fractions of the total dose of conventional therapy; and another that employs multiple doses at different intervals. These results suggest that treatment should be delayed until the patient's disease has completely recovered."
19776504,"In this study, the effect of ointment on caries is investigated. The first treatment was a glass ionicomer cement that was applied to 100 children in four months. After three-years, only 89.1 percent of the cement and 34.70% of sealants were completely lost. A second trial was performed to compare the preventive effects of two different types of materials: light-policymerized composite material and high viscosity resin-based products. Forty six boys and 59 girls were divided into two groups; one group was treated with an art procedure while the other was composed of composite resin or polymerizing resin over time. Over five years, both had no significant differences in their efficacy. This study was conducted at the training and research center for oral health in Damascs Syria Arab Republic. Thirty seven children were recruited from school close to the center. They were assigned into nine separate groups: Concrise, C, fluroshield, Heliosol clear chlorroma, vitremer, V / f th e g m n k h v u l b p w. Temperature and pH cycling were used. Enamol mineral loss was determined by cross section micro-hardening at distances. Fissure sealers are used as carouse preventives. Two different kinds of filler have been used since the beginning of this paper. One type has been developed for use as fission sealant and another has recently been introduced. These studies aim to evaluate the effectiveness of these new methods against existing practices. First, they apply conventional glass Iono Mer cement to 200 children per day. Second, it is applied by dentists who perform the application. Third, there is also an autopolymersized resin base sealed with Delton. Finally, all teeth are checked after 4 years."
27505198,"In this paper, we examine whether an acceptance-based approach to eating reduces food cravings in overweight and obese adults. Forty two women were assigned to eat no food for the previous four hours or not hungry conditions. They reported stronger food desires than they did when they were given ""control"" or ""ardic reappearance."" The present study uses an analog model to investigate the efficacy of two approaches for dealing with food temptations: 1) Acceptance-oriented strategies; and 2) Self-reporting measures of chocolate craving"
25251296,"In this study, we examine the effects of weight loss and exercise on body composition in patients with restrictive anoexia nerveosa. We compared changes in body mass before and after full-body weight restoration in 50 women who had been previously treated with anorexia nervosesa to determine whether these changes were related to eating disorder symptoms or psychological distress. The results showed that only percent bodyfat was associated with worse long-term outcomes than other treatments."
23235652,"This study focuses on the effects of prenatal zinc treatment on infants who are at risk of low-birth weight. It is a double blinded, part-blind and ommized trial with two groups: 1) pregnant women receive daily doses of 5mL Fe and 250mg folate; 2) mothers receive only 15mM Zn as an amino acid cheate; and3) children receive either placebo or both treatments. In this study, we examine the affect of zinc supplementing on growth, morbidness, and motor performance in healthy, term-fed infant girls from poor-poor countries. The results suggest that zinc deficientiency may lead to delayed development and reduced growth and psychomotion. Iron andzin deficiencies are associated with delays of development, growth falters, increased infectious disease Morbidity during early childhood and childhood. Although iron and zinc have been reported to be beneficial in some studies, there is little evidence for their efficacy in improving mental health in children."
30058911,"In this paper, Dr. Rivers focuses on the association between physical activity and disease. He discusses several examples of how polymorphic exposures may have a beneficial effect on disease while still being susceptible to confounding. For example, in this study, body mass index is associated with an increased risk of sudden coronary syndrome among men and women who do not exercise at high intensities. This suggests that there may be some added benefit from higher intensity exercise alone. However, it is unclear whether these effects are due to changes in the early stages of weight gain or because of other lifestyle factors. The authors conclude that over-experimental overfeeding leads to improvements in both fitness and blood pressure."
30626326,"The aim of this paper is to develop a risk prediction tool for European adults aged 40-74 years. It uses laboratory-based measures and recalibrates risk scores for different sex groups in each country. In addition, the model predicts 10-year risk from fatal and nonfatal heart disease in adults who are older than 40 years old. This work also includes two versions of the ""Questionable Risk Score"" that have been used to predict risk in various countries. The first version was published in March of 2008. The second version has been validated by an open-ended cohort of 531 patients with over 16 million people. A total population of 2.22 million persons aged 35-75 years with 140000 cardiovascular events. Overall population comprised 2.82 million men who were white nor whose ethnicity was not recorded; 22 013 South African, 1155 black African or 10402 black Caribbean, and 19 992 from Chinese Or other ethnic groups. Results are reports from 'a trial of multiplefactorial preventionof coronary heart condition' in occupational groups: r and Omization of 6 factories to interventionand control. Net average declines in the treatment factors were / 1.2 p.. Plasma cholesterol? 8.9 g. daily cigarettes... 0.4 b. weight.... 2 %)."" Red blood cell fat acid profiles were considerably changed. There was no overall reduction of 7 % in death from chest disease. Although CDS has become widely accepted, it must still continue to evolve as new information became available and when mistake or other methods of improving them be identified. Finally, we investigate the effects of routinely screening for risk factor for ischaemia and repeated lifestyle counseling on the 10 Year development of Ischaemic Heart disease at Count Dr. Manette's hospital in Denmark. After four weeks of follow-up, mortality from CHD declined significantly. Mortality per 1,000 men in both groups declined slightly but to some degree for the upper-risk group. Furthermore, using the Score improved the risk of CVD in general."
21496652,"In this study, the efficacy of a new pulpotomy material, mineral trioxine aggregate, on immature teeth is compared. Thirteen children with at least two permanent teeth are selected for this trial. The conventional Ca-OH-2pulpotting technique is used in group 1, while the MTA Pulpotomy procedure is performed in experimental fashion. Histology evaluations are performed on three total caries removal and 18 direct capping teeth after treatment. No significant difference in clinical  symptomsatology resulted between these two groups. A prospective study comparing partial pulpometry to complete carious removal showed that there was no significant differences in histological assessment of signs or symptoms. However, all teeth showed hard cell barrier formation during the observation period. This discovery and those of other others have helped gained more recognition for partially pulpitomic treatment as an alternative therapy when pulses were exposed by deep lesions and bleeding pulp was exposed during excavating. These findings help gain more recognized for partial paddling than any other treatment because diseases of the tooth pulp often havean infectious origin; and treatments are meant to control infection of root canal system. Although many different opinions still prevail in the field of endodontic practice, recent advances in biologically derived knowledge have been adopted to advance scientific methods."
24529937,"Preoperative exercise testing has been used to predict post-morbidity and death in patients with lung disease. This study aims to assess the impact of preoperative exercises on surgical outcome inlung cancer patients. Forty five patients were assigned to an inpatient rehabilitation program, which included strength training and endurance training. The results showed significant increases in work performance as well as improvements in health-related life. In this study, we compare the effect of resistance training on exercise tolerance and improvement in quality of living after lung rsection. We conclude that it is not yet clear whether exercise training can improve survival for patients who have had recurrent lung lesions."
28559211,"Orlistat, a weight loss and anti-obesis agent, has been used in the United State for over two years. In this study, patients with hypertension who lost more than eight % their body weight after six months of treatment were reprimanded for having lost less than they had before. The subjects were then assigned to receive either placebo or one of three different diets: 1) an all-out hypocalorous diet; 2) eat only moderate amounts of fat; or 3) supervised exercise. This trial was designed to assess the effectiveness of any combination of diet, exercise, and behavior on overweight and obesity patients. It showed that orlistate reduced blood pressure by reducing lipoprotein concentrations as well as increasing total and lowdensity LDL cholesterol levels. Furthermore, it improved the health of obese patients suffering from Type IIA and IIID disease. These patients also lost greater weight than those treated with other drugs. Aim: To compare the efficaciousness of oristat and sibamine treatment in treating excessively high-cholestrolemia. We studied nine patients aged 18-75 years with type IIIA/IIID diseases. They were divided into two sub-study groups each receiving either 100mg or 120mG or placebo. After 6 months, these subjects lost about 8 p.m. at the end of the double blind phase. For comparison, we examined the effects of 1,500 mg or 1200 Mg Oligophine per day on changes in Body Mass Index, Blood Pressure, Fasting glucose, Serum Lipid Profile, Glycemic Score, etc."
26243549,"This study consists of two parts: first, an attempt to determine the effect of trunk flexor and trunk extension on post-stroke patients; and second, to estimate the changes in knee muscles after stroke. The subjects consisted of 25 postmenoplegics and 25 healthy controls. In this study, the peak torques were measured at different velocity ranges from 0 degrees to 150 degrees/sec. A second purpose was to establish reliable isokinetic performance measurements for measuring the strength of the lower limbs of postwardly hemiphobic patients. It was found that there was no significant difference in the best work between right and left direction of Trunk rotation in both groups. Finally, we established reliability of Upperlimb muscle performance among adults with post Stroke heiparesesis. Ten adults performed isakinetic concentric shoulders, elbow functons, and extension three times per day at 3 critterion speeds. Real speed and power also were analyzed. Relive reliability was excellent for Torment and Power but less consistent than Speed."
24710915,"In this study, we examine the effects of high fiber diets on body weight loss and lipid profiles in middle-aged patients. The results suggest that low-glycemox diet is more effective than the ""happy American"" diet because it lowers fasting blood concentrations and reduces both lipoprotein and total cholesterol levels. We also assess whether pinto beans improve colonic feces formation by increasing colonial SCFA formation. This study concludes that consumption of legumes can be used as a novel source of food for improving body composition and risk factors in people with type 2 diabetes."
23035863,"In this double blinded, rand omization trial, infants are given either a control or study formula containing two different strains of Probiotics. The primary outcomes are infectious episodes, number of infectionrequiring antibiotics and incidence of injuries. After the intervention period, blind follow up continued until 2 mo of life. This study compares the effects of an infant-formulated formula with varying levels of prebiotic/probiotic ingredients on the intestinal health of healthy term children. Before birth, babies were assigned one of three formulations: BifiDobacterium LongumBL999, LactoBACILLUS RAHAMSONS LPR, BIfidoBactium animalis Sp. Lactis or Unsupplemented Formula. Prior to birth in Italy, pregnant women were roused before receiving placebo or LacTobacillus Rhamnosus G. At that time, probiotic treatments were used for 6 months. Infants fed their own breast-fed formulas showed improved growth and stool characteristics than those who were treated with conventional feeds; however, there was no difference in the safety or tolerance of these regimens at any time points."
28079254,"This study focuses on the effect of hemostatic markers on risk of major artery disease and stroke in patients who are not at risk for these conditions. The results indicate that higher levels of all five blood-stained markers are associated with increased risk, but not fatal event. In this study, we assess the impact of various factors on bleeding severity in an attempt to determine which factor is most likely to be protective. We conclude that high-risk men receive more than one risk factor before surgery and that it is difficult to predict whether they will have a stroke or other serious complications after surgery. Aortic ruptures are common and can lead to sudden death in women. Although there is some evidence that endovascular repairs reduce the rate of rupture, little is known about their long-term safety."
25686893,"In this paper, the authors describe a new technique for reducing the risk of infection following surgical procedures with either antimbiotic suture or conventional sutures. They assess the rate of infected patients after shunt procedure and then compare it to that of patients who have surgery without the treatment. The authors conclude that the key is to reduce the infection rate by preventing the growth of bacteria in the operation field and wound. A double blinded control study is performed on all patients treated with ventricloperitoal spitting devices. This study was followed from November 2005 until May 2007 and the follow up period was three months after surgery. It showed that there was no difference in anesthesia times between patients receiving CSF ostinulation and controls."
18797052,"The purpose of this paper is to assess the reporting standards of rand and omolized controlled trials in the primary care of brain tumor patients. Two investigator-in-chiefs searched all published papers for R& Omized trials from January 1990 to December 2004, and evaluated the quality of reports, key method etic factors reporting, and intended use of these studies. In this study, adhesive zinc oxide was used as additional therapy for leprocy patients with Plantar ulcers; the effectiveness of either treatment was compared against that of usual treatment alone. At an equal level of physical activity, both treatments were effective. A comparison was made between two strengths of topical povidone soliloquy suspension: 2 % or 4 p.m. This investigation was carried out on 45 lefsy patient with acute  trophyic ulcerations. Both groups received a combination of dressings at different intervals. After four weeks, wound healing was observed. When comparing the efficacy of each treatment, the group receiving ketansiner showed superior results than the other treated with saline. Only re and/or omemed trials are sufficient to predict cause and effect directly."
15330925,"In this study, we examine the effect of a combination of brief psychological intervention and controlled medical treatment on depressed patients with recurrent bowel disease. The results suggest that both methods are highly effective in treating these patients. For example, Beck's depression inventory shows that CB is more rapid than PI, but there is no evidence that either method does any better than the other. We also determine the frequency and severity of complaints of Gastro-intestinal disease in adult patients who undergo upper endoscopes. This study concludes that psychological treatment may be more effective than conventional medical treatments for patients suffering from irritable or chronic bloating."
21328298,"This paper describes the results of a large, three-arm, multi-centre study on patients with colon cancer. The aim is to compare short-lived quality of life after laparoscopic or open surgery for coloncancer. In this study, we assess the effect of fast track care on postoperative recovery in patients who have elective colonectomy. We also examine the safety of using fast tracks as an alternative to traditional perioperative regimens."
26864742,"This paper presents a study of the adult population in Italy on the characteristics of ""hypurecemia"" and ""goutyarth."" The characteristics investigated are: 1) the prevalence of hypourication, 2) the frequency of secondary hyperuricemia, 3) the relationship between hyperuricity and age, and 4) the risk of developing Gout-Arthritus for each ucul acid level. In this study, we aim to determine whether or not lowering serum Urate to less than sixmg/dl is associated with changes in the joint appearances of patients who have giout. Thirty people with psoriasis were recruited from clinical  registrys across Italy. There was limited evidence on any non-pharmacotic intervention for guout; however, this work aims to assess the influence of flora and other features on functional pain and health-regarding quality of life in patients with Guertoid arthritis. A total of thirty-six patients had gotten one of four pairs of shoes after wearing them for eight weeks. The primary objective was foot pain by 100mm visual anelogue scale. After 8 weeks, the primary outcome was Foot pain using at least 100 millimeters V Analogue Scale. To develop another measure of bone erosion that could be used as an outcome measures for chronic bpox studies, including the Omeract Filter. It was found that there were no significant differences in US findings between joints in men with acute vs. post-injured limbs but only in those with multiple rhematic conditions. We conclude that Uulsonography can be useful for deciphering signs of crystal deposition inside the feet of individuals suffering from grotesque disease."
27755209,"This study focuses on the effect of an eccentric-focusing resistance training program on older women's muscle strength and function. The subjects are assigned to either concentric or eccentric phases, and they perform exercises in each phase for six weeks. In this study, we examine the effects of eccentric training on extensomuscular function as well as bone mineral dentition and body composition among older adults. We also investigate the influence that exercise with whole-body vibratory vibrations can have on balance ability and muscle mass in elderly people. Although previous studies have found conflicting results, this is the first study to evaluate the efficaciousness of two different types of exercise training: short-term endurance training and high-vegetation resistancetraining. It is shown that both groups increase muscular strength at different frequency intervals during the eight-week trial. Both groups show significant increases in legextension peak power and hip strength after the intervention. A mail-based treatment for saropenia prevents loss of muscle Mass in older adult women."
29686540,"This paper focuses on the costs of fall prevention for older adults. It uses a mixed-effects approach to assess the efficacy of an exercise program and falls intervention in older people. The study concludes by comparing the cost effectiveness with that of usual care. In this case, it is more cost effective than expected. However, there are still some concerns about the safety of elderly people who receive regular physical activity as preventive measures against falling."
26239041,"A pharmacist-hospital organization with a payment-for- performance incentive for generic drug use has been trialed to determine whether it is more effective in improving the GDR than academic detailing alone. The results of this trial are compared to an observational study that compares the effects of remumning and reduction of prescribed drugs on quality of care among US Medicare patients with depression. In contrast, the provision of universal access to high-quality prescriptions reduces both the risk of spending increases and the increase in the cost of medicine. This paper also discusses changes in medical practice in England during the period following the introduction of the national health care reform act. It shows that fundholding practices have improved their prescribting practices by cutting the number of item prescribed per patient as well as increasing the amount of money they spend on brand name drugs."
30002686,"In this study, we examine the relationship between low-dose magnesium and risk of sudden death in a group of patients with acute coronary disease. The results suggest that high-molecular-mg diets may be protective against heart attack in patients who have had an acute episode of chest pain. We investigate the effect of magnesium on serum levels of creatinines phosphokinatase, Creinine phokinases-MB group, lactatedehydrogenased, creactive protein, and cardiactroponin I after cardiopulmonary bypass. There is no significant difference in the concentrations of these two groups. Acute phase response: This may contribute to Type 2 Diabetes and Cardio disease risk."
21733234,"In this paper, we describe a doubleblind comparison of maintenance treatment for patients who have panic disorder with either alprasolam or imipramine over the next six months. The results are quite similar to those of placebo in that they all improve during the first two months and then continue their improvement after 6 months without significant change in dosages. Paxetine has also been shown effective in treating anxiety disorder in three 10 to 12 week studies. A serotonine-reuptake inhibiter is increasingly being used as an antidepressante in these patients. Although it does not seem to be highly effective, sertraline seems to show greater efficacy than placebo when compared to other drugs. This study compares fluvoxamian with placebo among outpatients with DSMIV criteria for Panic Disorder. It was found that fluvocxamine had less frequent major attacks from the second week on and reduced severity and frequency at the sixth week. Another study examines the safety andefficacy of citaloperam in patients with panic disorder. Thirteen patients were assigned to receive 8 weeks of single blinded open label sertriline or placebo. They were divided into four groups: one group received clonalzepam; another group took olanzpine. These subjects showed no apparent adverse effects upon follow-up. We conclude that relapse preventment via biblio therapy is more effective than any other form of treatment because it reduces risk for rebound panic. However, there is little evidence regarding the long term use of such treatments. For example, several studies suggest that exercise may help relieve symptoms of panic disorders. Other studies indicate that chronic exercise can increase the efficacity of drug treatment in cases where panic attack is prominent."
29676540,"In this study, Wuthering Heights et al. suggests that a high-fat, low-carbohydrate weight loss diet can improve the artery stiffness of obese adults. The results suggest that fat loss alone is not sufficient to improve blood pressures and other measures of health in overweight patients. Aiming to investigate the effect of long-chain polyunstained fatty acids on the tissue of Type 2 diabetes patients, we compare the effects of fish oil with placebo on body weight, lipid concentrations, and abdominence of disease-causing markers. We conclude that these compounds have beneficial effects on both type 2 and Type 3Dimmation, but their effects remain poorly understood."
28741090,"This study aims to evaluate patient preferences regarding sildenal citrate or ""tadallafil"" for treating ED in Chinese men who are naive to Pde5 inhibitors. The patients were divided into two groups: those who received silldenaphil 5mg per day and those whom received it after 8 weeks. In this group, the patients preferred tame-citric treatment while those with phosphatdiesterase Type 5inhibitor therapy preferred either of these two treatments. A mixed-effects model was used to predict which group would be more efficacious than the other."
26138144,"In this paper, we describe the use of a flexible endoscope to perform in tradetrusorbotulinum-A an infection-preventing technique for patients with overactive bladder. The authors evaluate this new approach by evaluating five patients and 22 women who have idived over active bladder that is not tolerated by current antimuscorinic agents. They compare the efficaciousness of either regimen against placebo in reducing the risk of UTI from 3 to 5 %). A doubleblind trial is performed to determine whether propholactic norficillinacin will reduce the incidence of Ury Trest infection after flexible cystoscopicscopy. All patients provide midstream urine sample before the procedure as well as on day 3 and 7 after FC. This study was terminated because of low patient recruitment. To determine theefficacy of proprophylactic  Nitrofurantanoin prior to Cystoscopie in decreasing the rate of Post-Procedure Urry Tract infection, We design and setting / A rand and ommized clinical trial among patients older than 18 years who underwent urodynastic and cystourenethrospic for any non urgent indication. Thirt thirty patients were assigned without receiving any prescription dose, and the intervening group received 3g fosmac trometamamol. There are debates about whether or not these studies should be used; however, there has been no concluding results."
19277652,"In this paper, we describe the results of a single total hip replacement procedure performed in patients who have primary osteoarthritis. The technique used for this study is described as ""mini-incision"" or ""stand and ard."" We compare the length of an incision to the traditional approach for complete hip surgery. A prospective observational study examines the effect of mini-Incisions on the outcome of total knee arthrostry. Although there is no scientific evidence for scar cosmesurgation, it is reported that more mini wounds are rated poorer than those with sterile scars."
28394643,"A safety study is performed on 108 healthy volunteers aged 18-62 years. The subjects receive either aspartame or placebo three times daily in capsule form for 24 weeks. No changes over time are noted, and there are no significant differences between group in the amount of symptoms they experience. This results further document that the long term consumption of asparame at dosages equivalent to 10 L of drink per day will improve blood glucose control in elderly subjects who have normal glucose tolerance. In both groups, tissue phosphorylation levels do not change after either treatment. However, acute hyperglysis does not alter plasma fibrinogenolysis in older subjects. Aspartamic sweeteners increase appetite and mood in overweight women. Over four weeks, men and women are divided into two groups: one group consumes sucrose sweetened drinks while the other group abstains from them. Both groups lose their initial body weight during an active weight reduction program. After a 16-wk period, all women were assigned to either diet or absolane from sugarsweetened beverages. They lost about 10 percent of their first body pounds during this period. When they consumed fructosal or glucose sweetners, they gained less overall calories and more grams of fat. These studies suggest that as partamine may be useful for weight loss because it has been used widely since the early 1900s."
30025880,"Neck pain is the most common ailment in office workers. To date, there has been little evidence that neck pain causes this disease. This study aims to prospectively assess risk of neck injury in an African-populated worksite. It uses blood flow and oxygenation measurements collected from fifty right-h or ed desk workers as controls. The results indicate that both groups have different levels of back pain. In addition, studies using only r and Omized trials often overestimate the effectiveness of an intervention. A new tool was developed for assessing risks of bias in studies used by non-randomed studies."
20512292,"In a six-month prospective study, the safety and effectiveness of nitedipine as an acutely effective treatment for hypertension in outpatients with severe symptoms. The results were: 1) Nifepidine reduced bloodpressure more rapidly than Captoprill 60 minutes after initial ingestion but was at 240 minute equal degrees of drop in blood pressure; 2) Both agents were conspicuous successful in reducing blood tension. This suggests that combination therapy with either agent should be subject to further trials in acute severehypertension. A double blinded study is performed to compare the effects of both drugs on middle cerebral blood flow during crisis in the immediate emergency department. Two hundred fifty one patients present acute hypertensively crises, defined by systelic arterial pressure greater than 160 mm H G. Only 105 patients sawked help for any pathology related To determine whether sublingualally administered bp/ captopriml would be helpful in treating hypertense criseses, we treated thirty consecutive black patients who received either bribe or placebo capsules. Blood pressure reduction over 4 hours wasmoniously significant in all 3 categories by three minutes. Isradpine is used as antihysteria in this patient population. It has been suggested that it may be useful in relieving excessive diastigating forces caused by hypertrophic scarlet fever."
19370565,"In this paper, we examine the effects of an herbal blend on men with a benign prostatichypoplasia. The results show that saw palmeto improves urinary symptoms and quality of life in men who have symptomatic or mildly recurrent BPH. We also present r and Omized double blindd studies of saw-paletto's efficacy in patients with moderate to severe symptoms of benign Prostacia. A doubleblind trial was performed in which 225 men aged 45 to 80 were assigned to receive either 160 millig/d per day or placebo. After two weeks, all patients were treated for 24 weeks. This study examined the effect of Saw palmerto extract on Urodynamic and Sexological Scores in Men With Benign Prostatic hyperplusa; it showed significant improvements in Urinaryflow rate, Postvoid Respiration Volume, and Internationalprostate Symptom score. It also showed improvement in Quality of Life scores as well as Urortic flow rate."
24857402,"A large randomized study of a short form of mental therapy, manual-aided cognitive behavior therapy -- MACT -- against treatment as usual for self-harm was found to be cost effective. In contrast, the frequency of these episodes was less than that of TAU in the Mact group. Bipolar disorder is associated with poor quality of life and depression is limited. Antidepressant treatment has been especially important in treating patients with depressed moods because it can lead to changes in their physical and mental well-being. The use of an instrument called the Self-Report Questionnaire or ""SF-36"" has also been used to assess health status in patients who have had recurrent bouts of self harm. These studies aim to compare two different measures of health-related satisfaction: the European Quality Of Life Measure and the American Quality of Life Survey. Both measures are highly regarded in medical practice. For example, one measure uses hypothetical preferences while the other uses actual patient characteristics. This study investigates the efficacy of long-term bipolar medication by comparing the effects of this treatment on both symptoms and function."
29888490,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates the use of an in-vito method to evaluate the effect of different materials on tooth fragments that have been re attached to their remaining teeth. He uses Rayyan, a web and app that helps speed up the initial search of abstracts and titles, as well as providing accurate results about the efficacy of various restorative materials. This study compares the strength of two different types of cement used to bond sectioned fractured teeth: 1) single bonding agent; 2) composite resin; and 3) double curing resin. The results show significant differences between the two groups."
15754663,"In this double blinded, parallel group trial of patients who have major depression and are not at all seriously ill, fluoxetine is more effective than imipramin in improving their symptoms. A doubleblind placebo-controlled trial compares the efficaciousness and safety of pramiproxole a dophin D1 receptor agonist to venlfaxine in patients with Major Depressive disorder. Both drugs improve on measures of depressed mood but side effects are less severe. The results indicate that sertraline has fewer sideeffects than does amiriptyline; however, there is no significant difference in the severity of adverse events during treatment."
21414043,"This study aims to evaluate the effects of weight loss on body composition, blood lipid levels, and post-pranopr and Ial Insulin response to two different diets. The first was a carbohydrate-rich diet with high-protein content; the second was an energy-restricted diet that consisted of low-carbogeneous carbohydrates. In this study, subjects were divided into three groups: 1) chocolate-enriched diet for rapid reduction of body weight; 2) fat-deprived group for reduced body mass; and 3) control group without exercise. After six months, both groups lost significant weight. A further study was designed to determine whether preoperative food habits could predict outcome after laparcooscopic gastric bypass or vertical band edging. Although several studies have reported greater weight losses after these procedures, no single study has examined the effect of eating behavior on weight Loss is associated with increase in mortality. However, few long-term interventional studies report any association between weight gain and improved health."
28968486,"In this study, we examine the effect of a protein-hysate preterm formula on gastric transit time in infants. Thirteen preterminal children with gestational ranges from 29 to 32 weeks were assigned either ard or st-and-ard premembrance formula. The results showed no significant difference in symptoms of feeding outlerance during the first three weeks of life. A multi-centre controlled clinical trial was performed to evaluate the effects of an extensively-hydrallyzed premetal formula onto the feeding and development of pre term babies. Preterm patients had been divided into two groups: those who received conventional feeds after birth and those that received only partially-Hydrolysed milk. This study examined the influence of early breastfed feeding on the disease burden of asthma at 5 years of age. It found that the use of highly-hydroxylized cow's milk formula improved the risk of allergic diseases but did not lead to any significant differences in the severity of these diseases."
30249972,"In this study, we examine the effect that vitamin E and calcitario acid on liver enzymes in patients with Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease. We conclude that there is no well-to-do medical treatment for this condition because of its high prevalence and poor efficacy. This study focuses on children with nonalcoholic fat liver disease who receive either lifestyle modification or antioxidant therapy. The results suggest that both regimens will be effective in treating this disease."
31168050,"In this study, we examine the effects of a low-carbidohydrate diet on Type 2 diabetes in women. We aim to compare the effect of changing the amount of carbohydrates or the source of carbogeneics on gycated haeglobin, Hba1c, plasma glucose, and lipids in Type 2, diabetic patients. The subjects were divided into two groups: high carbohidrate, high glycocemic-list ; high-cabriate /low-gealcohydrate '""high-monouncinsaturated fat""."" This study was designed to assess the efficacy of different levels of consumption of high resistance starch for improving insulin sensitivity in individuals with waist circumferential 89 cm. Women received either 15 or 30 gram per day of resistant starchit as control. A mean difference of 28.3% was found between the three groups. These results suggest that resistant starches may be useful for people at risk of type 2 disease."
25053215,"In this paper, Anderson demonstrates that exercise is the most effective predictor of weight loss in patients with obesity. He uses a novel approach to track changes in body weight over 18 months: 1) behavior therapy; 2) walk attendance; and 3) financial incentives for making up walking intervals. The results suggest that physical activity is not sufficient to induce long-term change in weight. However, post-hoc analysis suggests that the levels of exercise needed are much higher than those usually recommended in psychological treatment programs. This paradox arises from the fact that many people would be willing to pay researchers money to participate in an extended smoking cessations trial, yet few would balk at paying their employees extra money if they were not smoke free for one year. Thus, corporations and government health plans are increasingly using incentive-based approaches to augment health while hopefully increasing production and savings. These include cash or cashlike incentives to encourage uptaking of healthy behaviors, or payment or penalty to discourage unhealthy behavior. Although previous studies have found no evidence of cost-effective strategies for encouraging uptake of healthier habits, Hamilton concludes that these methods may be more cost effective than other forms of public health intervention."
27452342,"This study focuses on the long-term performance of composite restorations used for indirect inlays and fillings. The results show that there is no significant difference in the wear of these two types of restoration, but there are some differences between the direct and indirect systems. In this study, patients were treated with either direct or indirect resin composites to determine whether they were as effective as conventional restorative materials."
27218592,"This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of metronidale with two p.m. vaginalicillin cream or Lactobacilus acidphilus probiotic for reduction of recurral bacterial virginity in women. It is a double blinded, placebo controlled trial that assesses colonization efficiency, safety, tolerable and acceptability as compared to placebo. The results suggest that Lactin V may be an advantageous treatment for vaginoses because it contains both native and pathogen-killing strains. In this paper, we report on the use of LacTobacillus Rhamnosus G-1 and LacTOBACILLUS RECURVI RC-14 as antimicrobial agents against BV. We conclude that these compounds are safe and effective for treating venomous vulvostial disease."
30514444,"This study demonstrates the efficacy of direct pulpcapping in human teeth. It is a novel technique that uses an enamel matrix to create hard tissue, which can be used to bridge tooth defects. In this paper, CaOH and MTA are used as capping agents. The results of these two new technologies are compared in terms of patient response and histology."
28003033,"In this paper, we describe a prospective cohort study of older adults in the United States. Two hundred and forty elderly adults were recruited from twelve general practice centers in urban and suburb areas. The purpose of the study was to assess relative risk of death and diagnoses new diseases over four years. We evaluated physical activity and performance with two hundredand forty older adult patients who were aged between 70 and 80. They were divided into three groups: poor, intermediate, or good. ADLs were measured at each patient's admission; they were then followed every three months by telephone interview to ascertain function decline, new hospitalizeds, and vitality. This study is an observational population-based followup study that examines the effect of muscle strength on mortality in older people. It uses the Short Physical Perfection Battery as an objective assessment of physical performance. There is no concluding evidence for its efficacy in predicting long-term Mortality in very old individuals attending primary care."
29740667,"In this study, we examine the effect of an eight-month dietary regimen on bone mineral density in older women. We conclude that it is not possible to prevent hip fractures with a diet high in animal and vegetable foods. However, there is some evidence that consumption of these foods can reduce risk of fracture in both genders. The results of this trial are as follows: 1) men consume more fruits and vegetables than women; 2) women consume less dairy; and 3) milk improves bone health in elderly women who have low calcium levels. This study also investigates the association between food frequency question questions and injury risk in two different groups of patients. A group of healthy women receives 900 milligrams of cacaricine daily while another group gets 500 millimog of vitamin D per day. These results suggest that cows may be at greater risk for fracture than men because of their higher CaCaricin content."
30099652,"In this study, we examine the effect of probiotic and pre-andprobiotic treatment on gut microbial composition in patients with acute chronic kidney disease. We conclude that proliferating a high-content, i.e. cultured strain of bacteria may be an effective strategy for slowing down the progression of chronic dialysis. Our primary aim is to determine whether probiota can reduce the generation of key Urine-Nephrovascular Toxins in Chronic Kidney Disease patients. The results of this trial are as follows: improvement in blood urine nitrogen, creatinines, anduric acid levels; reduction in inflammation and general well being. A double- blinded placebo-controlled crossover trial was conducted at two public hospitals in Mexico to assess Renadityl's safety andefficacy. This study also investigates the effects of Probinul Neutro®, which has been shown to lower plasma phosphocresol concentration by inhibiting the growth of endogenous compounds such as uremic solutes. It is furthermore studied in thirty-seven consecutive patients who have moderate to severe chronic renal disease or other complications. These patients will be provided either with synbiotics or placebo for six weeks. After these studies, they will all be followed up in another patient population."
32428841,"In this study, we examine the effects on weight loss in a group of overweight patients who have recently undergone an all-out weight reduction. The results show that there is no difference in body weight between the two groups. A fasting diet has been shown to improve blood pressure and fat distribution in people with high risk of heart disease. This study compares the effect of consuming energy dense foods on changes in both body composition and body fat. We conclude that low-energy dense diets may be more effective in terms of weight control than conventionally-reduced food regimens."
32059350,"In this paper, we use publicly available evidence to determine whether or not there is a causation between the two groups of drugs. We first perform Mendelian R and Omization using summary-level genomic-wide data collected from the International Candor Consortium and the psychiatic Genomics Consortium. The results suggest that CUDs are associated with different degrees of severity in patients with mild to moderate schizophrenia. Although some studies have suggested it may be related to variation in mental function, others have found mixed results. For example, one study suggests that an elevated anandamine level in cerebrospisal fluid increases the risk of psychotic behavior. Another study reports that cannbidiol has antipsyotic properties but does not lead to significant improvement in symptoms. A double blinded parallel-blind cross-over trial was used to assess safety and efficacy of Cannabidol in acute schizophrenia as well as its effect on current psychological functions. This study also uses genetic variants to predict the association between Cannabis use and disease. It finds that people who use cannabis tend to have more severe forms of illness than those who do not."
29564527,"In this chapter, we present the results of a prospective, single-centre, random-distribution study of patients with parosmal atrium fibrillation who underwent either cryoballon ablation or conventional open-irrigated radiofrequency catheterablation. The results suggest that both methods are safe and efficacious for treating paroxysal atrial fibrilation in patients without persistent complications. A comparison of these two approaches is made. For example, an eight-month trial showed that Cryobelloon was superior to RFA in terms of patient safety and cost. This paper also discusses the role of controlled trials in determining the efficacies of various different techniques for treatment of paralyzed heart disease."
26293406,"In this paper, Anderson focuses on the effects of atrial pacemaker versus ventricular pulsing on patients with sick Sinus Syndrome. He concludes that after an extended period of follow up, atrium pacing seems to be associated in terms of less risk of heart failure and mortality than either type of treatment. The results of this study are described in detail. After three years, there is no difference in the rate of complications from first implantation nor replacement of permanent pacemakers. A large multi-centre trial has been performed for elderly patients who receive a dualchamber or single chamber pace maker. This study was designed to determine the incidence and prediction of serious complications following first implant or elective replacement of permanently pacemaking systems. It was concluded that older patients were at increased risk due to their greater severity of disease."
31928080,"This study focuses on the effect of coconut oil on body composition, fat distribution, and metabolic markers in healthy women. In this paper, we examine the effects of three different types of fats on blood lipid profiles: coconut-oil, palm-Olein or virgin olive oils. We compare the changes in blood lipoprotein levels after four weeks of consumption of one of these three ""alternative"" fatty acids to those of conventionally-classified fat such as soybean fat or coconut fat. The results suggest that both diets are effective at lowering total cholesterol and LDL concentrations. A high-fat diet is associated with reduced risk of heart disease because it contains large amounts of unsullied fat; however, studies have shown that other dietary sources may have different effects on health."
26888184,"Antithrombotic therapy for strokes is recommended in patients with parosmal atrium fibrillation. In this paper, we systematically examine the effect of anticoagulation on stroke risk and mortality in elderly patients who have persistent atrial fibrillations. We conclude that there is little evidence of a direct or indirect cause of stroke in these patients. Aim Anticipation prophylaxis may be effective in treating stroke because it reduces the risk of fatal events. However, some studies have reported that warfarin does not work as well as rivanoxaban in terms of killing blood."
25121789,"In this paper, we describe a pilot study of an intervention that uses trained health workers to identify and confirm the presence of early-stage or metastatic breast andcervixcancers in women who have been previously referred for treatment. The results suggest that the use of trained nurses can be effective in reducing the risk of death from these two types of malignancies. We conclude that it is possible to reduce the burden of morbidity caused by unreliable medical care by using simple, easy-to-use methods."
25323058,"In this paper, we describe the results of an open label, double- blinded trial of blood pressure control in elderly patients. The outcome was a reduction of strokes and total death in those treated by strict treatment. We also report on the Japanese's abidipine research on antihypertensionsive effects in the elderly"" study. This is one of the first studies to assess the benefits of treating older adults with hypertension. It showed that there were no significant differences in risk or benefit between the two groups after three years of follow up. A second study examined the effect of benipidine as an active treatment for elderly people with stystoic blood pumps. These patients had fewer than 160 mmhg but more than 100 mhG. They received either thiazde diuretes or an anotensin convertor blocker. Both regimens were effective at preventing heart attack and stroke. However, they did not show any difference in mortality or morbidity during the follow-up period."
31553733,"Cost-effectiveness is a measure of how much money each patient spends on treatment. In this study, we examine the costs of routine and interventional approaches to atrial fillation in patients older than age 65 years. We find that annual pulse palpations are more cost effective than routine care when compared with an annual regimen from age 75 years; however, there is still some risk of stroke or embolism among those who have not been informed of their attriotic status. A comparison between intervals of time and frequency of visits for blood pressure detection suggests that less frequent checks may be more expensive than annual ones from Age 65 Years. The main outcome measure is newly identified atrium fibrillation. There is little information on its prevalence in Spain, but several studies have suggested that it is associated with considerable morbidity"
31944175,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective observational study in which patients who have cryptogenic strokes are assigned to receive continuous ECG monitoring. This is intended to determine whether brief episodes of devices-detained atrium fibrillation increase risk of stroke. We also examine the effect of different types or extracranial blood events on quality of life over 12 months after the event. Atrial fibrillation can be paroxismal and acutely symptomatic, making detection difficult. Oral treatment is highly effective for preventing stroke but it does not reduce the risk that occurs when patients with previous transient Ischaemic attacks experience. A novel anticoagulant, Apixa Ban, has been approved for stroke preventance in many countries. However, there is little evidence of its efficacy in patients without previous stroke nor in those with first-ever Stroke. The Cost-effectiveness Study was designed to assess the cost-efficacy of an insertable cardinal monitor against other noacins."
23697478,"This study focuses on the effects of an evidence-based, pharmacist-led hypertension care program on patients with elevated blood pressure. Physicians are assigned to either usual care or physician-pharmist comanagement groups. The physicians receive group education and participate in the development for an ""evidence-base"" approach to treating uncontrollable hypertensies. In this case, they identify patients who have high risk for heart failure and enroll them into a pharmacist's-direct lipid management regimen. Costs and consequences are analyzed to determine the impact of the intervention. These include: 1) A government- funded health care system; 2) A pharmacy manager; and 3) An extended pharmacist service. All studies aim to reduce readmissions from patients suffering from heart disease. However, these studies do not measure medication adherence nor do they report the actual cost of such services."
29765895,"Thirty-six human third moles, bovine and porcine incistors, and teeth were ground in SiC paper. After 24 hours of water storage, specimens are serially sectiond in the Buccal tongue direction to obtain hourglass shapes from each tooth. Self-etched adhesives have been used to prevent postopherical sensitivity when using posterior resin-base composite restorations. The authors test a secondfold hypothesis: ""A self-etch or Se, Ad will result in less Postoperative  sensivity than / total-Etching Ad""; an Elastic Ad would result more in enamel marred integrity than Te Ad. This study is designed to evaluate the strength of 'Clearfil SE Bond' on dentinate treated with Naocl and EDTA. It is intended to compare the effect of caries removal on bonding for two singlebottle systems. In this study, eighty uncured teeth are polished to expose dentine. Each tooth is divided into four groups according to the treatment given by the manufacturer. Two steps are followed: 1) Prime &Block 2.1 Aig; 2) Prime 3 Biag Pitch; and 3) Single Bond 3 M. They are then shear-tested at 0.5 m/min until cracking. These results are submi measured by anova after analysis by Newman Keuls"
25609995,"This paper focuses on the pre-opportunity of pain experience following total kneearthroplasty in patients with primary and revision knee surgery. It uses an observational prospective study to determine whether pain intensity changes over time, and whether these changes are related to pain severity. The results suggest that pain cataspizing and depression are more likely to be associated with poor pain outcomes than those caused by other risk factors. In this study, we use a combination of patient-specified pain-related questions and self-reported pain measures to predict pain at three and twelve months after total Knee Arthuroplasty."
28868822,"Green tea has been shown to have anti-disease and appetite-related effects, although it does not yet seem to be able to alter body weight or blood sugar levels. In this paper, we examine the efficacy of green tea extract on postpranal and iol hyperglycemia and antioxidant stress in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The effect of decafinated green coffee extract is compared to that of placebo in terms of changes in fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, and haemoglobin concentrations. This study concludes that green coconut extract may be an effective treatment for type 2 disease."
28506257,"In this paper, we describe the results of a double blinded, randomed controlled trial of homeopathic treatment for patients with fibromyalsgia. We assess the feasibility and predict the expected benefits of usual care over adjunctive care in patients who have Fibrojaalgic disease. The main outcome measure is the difference in FIQ score at 22 week. Context clinicians rely upon systematic reviews for current evidence-based information. A survival analysis from 100 meta-analyzes found that substantive changes in conclusions about the efficaciousness or harms were frequently and within short time periods. Implication: Clinically important evidence can accumulate rapidly."
22796243,"In this study, we examine the effect of stability exercise training on postural controls in patients with back pain. We find that subjects with control impairments show significant improvements in their disability scores and fears avoidance belief questions after the intervention compared to those with healthy controls. This study investigates the relationship between posture and breathing disturbances in people with low backpain. It is shown that there are differences in the mean changes in center of pressure between subjects suffering from low-back pain and normal subjects. The authors conclude that ""insight intothe mechanism of altered posturokinetic capacity in persons with Low back Pain can lead to better intervention for patients With low Back Pain"""
24166727,"Soy allergy is a common cause of severe asthma in children with cow's milk allergic to soy. Children who are sensitive to this type of food are usually treated with so-y formula for at least one year. The results of this study suggest that there may be an early history of such an anecdote and that the severity of the disease depends on whether or not the child has been given any treatment for it. Acute asthma is more likely to be fatal than mild persistent asthma, but long-term use of glucotonicosteroids appears to have some promise. However, although they are effective in treating recent onset, milder, longer-lived asthma patients, their efficacy has not yet been established"
31583250,"This study consists of two doubleblind, placebo controlled trials in which pregnant women were assigned either aprobiotic capsule with four different strains of bacterium or an equal amount of placebo. The results showed that the capsule was effective in reducing fasting blood glucose and improving insulin sensitivity. In addition, it improved the weight gain among newly-diagnosed gestational patients. These studies are important because they provide evidence for probiotics' efficacy in treating Type 2 diabetesmellitus. Although several studies suggest that probiota may help prevent this disease, little is known about their efficience."
28166606,"In this study, we compared the effects of either simva statin or simpvastatin together on hemostasesis and inflammation in patients with severe acute coronary disease. Both treatment groups showed similar efficacy. The strongest effect was seen when patients were given both drugs. Adipogenin can suppress Atherogenesis; inhibiting the absorption by blocking intestinal cholesterol absorbing by inhibitting Niemann- Pick C1-Like 1. Eezetimibbe selectively block intestinalcholestablishment by cutting intestinal lipoprotein concentrations. In animals, it reversed die-induced obesity, liver statosis, and Insulin resistance. This study is designed to assess the benefits of ezeetamibe on post-pr and Ial hyperlipidemia and hypergematicaemia in overweight subjects with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Plasma hsrelin concentration was significantly lower in all groups after 3 months."" Lipid-reducing therapy is associate with reduced cardiovascular risks. These studies are important because they show that lipid-lowing agents may be associated with improved blood levels of metabolicallyimportant hormones such as leptine."
23179416,"Two telephone surveys are conducted in April 18 and May 11 to collect Demographic, Education, Employment, and Income information. The results of these surveys reveal significant effects of behaviormodification and two dosesof methylphini date on classroom behavior and school performance of 31 children who have attention-difficit/hyeractivity disorder. In contrast, both treatments result in improvements beyond the effects alone. A study is presented that examines the effect of methylphadate on the treatment of adults with attentiondeficin/hyperaction disorder; it was found that the addition of one dose of MethYlpheni dates had a significant impact on academic performance as well as social behavior. This study compares four different forms of extended-relief preparations for treating patients with hyperactive or depressed moods. These include: 1) short-acting versions of MPH; 2) long- acting versions; and 3) modified-release versions. Both studies show significant changes in students' performance but do not lead to improvement in their overall health."
12917993,"In this paper, we describe the results of a two-year study in which girls with Turner Syndrome were treated with either human growth Hortense or ox plus rolone. The subjects showed an increase in their adult heights after treatment for at least six years. A second study was conducted in Canada to determine the effect of growth hormone on final height and sexual development of girls who had Turner syndrome. After two years, all patients received either recominant human growhortence or placebo. Both groups showed significant increases in height velocity as well as changes in bone age. This study concludes that GH improved the predicted height in Turner sisters."
24529402,"Telemonitoring is an effective and cost-effective intervention for patients with moderate or severely chronic opstructive pulmonary disease. In this paper, we report the results of a large-scale trial in which people who did not participate were recruited from three different groups: older people with mild or severe chronic Obstructively Pulmonous disease; those with heart failure or social needs; and those who had been hospitalized at least once during the previous years. The study was designed to assess the efficacy of using telemedicine to prevent frequent hospital admissions by improving patient satisfaction, patient empowerment, and health-regarding quality of life. We conclude that integrating self-management strategies into routine care can improve many aspects of patient outcome. A pilot telecommunications project in Swanea where sick patients received th and ard home mending equipment was conducted. This article discusses the use of ""The Health Buddy"" as an evidence-base for reducing the frequency of blood transfusions in patients suffering from chronic asthma."
24618584,"In this study, we examine the effects of contingent reinforcement on smoking behavior in a group of hired chronic smokers. We find that both payment groups show significantly lower levels of carbon monoxice and smoking reduction than those with no incentive. This is because some subjects fail to reduce Carbon monoxide sufficiently to contact reinforcer. The results suggest that incentives for smoking are not sufficient to prevent premature death among United States workers. Prior studies have shown that financial incentives can be effective in improving smoking cessations but have limited power; these studies may have been inadequate. A prior study showed that monetary rewards were effective at increasing return for skintest reading in newly recruited active drug or crack cocaine-useers. These studies examined the effect of prizes-based incentives upon retention and medicationadherence among 26 co-conspirators involved in an hepatisb vaccination series. They received $ 10 per week at each weekly visits, maximum possible earnings from additional payments on an escalated schedule for attending weekly monitoring andvacination visits with maximum potential earnings of $ 7,51. Another study was conducted to determine the efficacy of worksite health promotion programs in decreasing obesity and the prevalence of tobacco smoking. Thirty two work sites were assigned to treatment or without treatment for two years. Treatment included health education classes, self-help instructions, and incentive systems. Results at 2 year assessment were examined using relapsing measures."
25329390,"In this study, we examine the effects of a weight bearing physical exercise program on disease symptoms and quality of life for children with juvenile arthritis. The subjects are compared to healthy children in terms of pain, stiffness, and fatigue. We conclude that young children have improved their health after an eight-week period of physical training. Children with Jia report greater pain scores than those without JIA."
27460566,"In this study, we examine the resistance of tooth root to fracture with a series of different posts. Forty five bovine apices are sectioned and divided into three groups: fiberglass posts at 12 mm depth; glass-fiber posts luteted at varying depths; gii, 8 or GIII / 4 m. The samples were submitted tothe fracture resistance test on 'a universal testing device' at an angle from 135 degrees until fracture occurred. This study tests the hypothesis that coronal crown placement is associated with better survival of endodoncally treated smiles when preaccess, endodontiction, restorative factor are controlled. Purpose To determine if tooth Type and Ferrule significantly effect the survival rate for pulpless teeth restored with fiber post. Methods A sample of nine teeth in 89 patients were restored using snowpost: 34 intesors -- 12 canines -- 25 premorals and 16 millimeters. After 5 years, follow ups were established. Steerforth of Probb little information exists regarding how long it will take for permanent teeth to be restored with either type of posts or with direct composites. Puppies The aim of these studies was to evaluate whether treatment with full-coverages would improve the success rate of Endodonticly treated teeth restored by fiber posts and directly composite restorations"
31844350,"In this paper, we describe the results of a prospective, open-label, and non-infringed trial comparing the efficacy and safety of two different approaches for treating children with acutely complicated appendicetis. The primary outcome was compared to the success rate of urgent appendicement in patients who had uncomplicating acute appenticiitis without need for surgery. We also report that there is an increasing amount of scientific evidence supporting the use of antimicrobials as the most effective treatment for acuteappendicitus. This study compares the cost of antibiotics only versus emergency appeptectomy in treating unsimpleated acute Appenditits. Although the stewardship of these patients has not yet been established, it is clear that they are at high risk of long-term complications."
24321502,"In this paper, Barlow focuses on the use of mitonoxantrone as a curative treatment for men with progressive or rogen independent prostatecancer. He compares two treatments: docetaxell plus estramlustine and mitomexantonsone; and prednizone and postnisone. The primary outcome is overall survival. A secondary endpoint is progression-free life. Progression free survival is calculated by using Cox's regression analysis. Men who had relapsed to receive either immediate or delayed therapy were more likely to die than those who received no further treatment. To determine whether the time to recover from testosterone recovery is associated with risk of death, we performed an extended follow-up trial in men without localized metastatic disease. This study was followed by another single-blind pilot study in patients with stage D1 prostate cancer. It showed that degareliz remained effective in treating these patients."
30185438,"In this study, we examine the effect of short-term steroidal therapy on early relapses of atrial fibrilation. We conclude that it is possible to suppress ery in the first three months after ablation with a single dose of steroid. At least one observational study has shown that C-reactogen and interleuvinin-6 levels from the vein are associated with an increased susceptibility to inflammation. This study further investigates the use of prednimsolone as an anti-inflammatory agent in patients with acute atrium thrombility. It was found that corticoteroids were more effective than placebo in preventing rescapade after pleural vein isolation. A double blinded, i.e. multi-centre trial was conducted in 3 universities in Finl where 241 consecutive subjects without prior flutter or cuff were scheduled to undergo initial onpump chest artery bypassing graft surgery, cavalry arteries replacement, or combined cavag surgery and arthroptic valve replacement. The results suggest that low-dose chloritone may be effective for reducing late-stage AF occurrences."
30306544,"In this paper, we describe a method to determine the significance of change in score on quality-of-life instruments by using an approach that compares them to ""global ratings of changes"" in patients with different health conditions. Tadalofil improves lower Ury Trch symptoms in clinical studies and has not been examined together with active control in international studies. A double blinded, international, parallel- group study assesss men aged 45 years who have lower urine tract symptoms or benign prostatichypoplasia. The International Prostate Score is 13 and the maximum Urodynamic flow rate is 4 to 15ml/cm. This trial investigates efficacy as well as safety of two alpha-A1 antagonists: tamson and nattopidil. Both groups show significant improvement in the Internationalprostate Symptom Scope when compared to the enzymatic group. To compare treatment with placebo for treating lower bladder symptoms, We comparing theefficacy and safety from two '1A-recepter subtypes', Naftodipil and SiloDosin. Although well designed large-scale controlled studies are missing, the optimal dosage was not always completely decided. No study has studied the discomfort of all lower Ury Tract symptoms; Luts -- suggestive of BPH -- in individuals but has been cited as the ""most bothersome."" There is no evidence against the use of either drug except for some cases where it seems to be superior to other drugs. Another study focuses on the effects of combination therapy with alphosphoryl blocking agents such as finasterides and propiverine. It concludes that both regimens lead to improvements in overall urinary tract condition."
30953308,"The purpose of this study is to assess whether childhood Cardiorespiatory fitness and muscular fitness traits predict adult blood-glucosometry measures. In a longitudinal study, 623 participants measured their muscular strength, power, endurance, and muscle composition at the age 16 years. This study was followed by another one in which we examined the association between physical activity and cardiovascular risk factors for youth and adulthood. We found that leisure sports activities were associated with improved health later in life. Musculoskelah pain is very common throughout adultity with pronounced impact on health, function, participation in society. However, there is still confusion as to whether overall muscles strength in young men are related to self-reported musculonskeletal pain in adults."
31720713,"Transcranial Direct current stimulation is used in many different disorders after stroke, including upper-limb motor dysfunction. The effect of combined treatment body weight- supported treadmill training and tdcs on gait functions recovery of strokepatients was reported. Thirt thirty stroke patients participated in the study. Bone fragilities contribute to increased fracture risks but little is know about the onset of post- stroke bone loss. This study consists of an assessment of bone mineral deniesitometry, bone geometry, and microstructure within 6 months following stroke. Muscle weakness is impaired in people with acute stroke because of their reduced muscle strength. A proof-ofconcept study evaluates the efficaciousness of a one-year randolent, an Intrvenous Bisphosphonate In preserving hipbone density after Stroke. Methods: An initial cohort of 27 newly hemiplicitc patients were assigned to get four mg of the Intrvenously Bisphonates within 35 days. Parameter values were independent from each other; low correlations, high reliability between trials and day. Hemisplegic men are susceptible to bone losses and alteration in fat and mass which ultimately affect rehabilitation status andpropensity for bone fractures. These studies aim to determine whether changes in bone Mineral Density after severe stroke are associated with motor impairment, disability, or the development of ""hemiosteroporoseis."""
28578534,"This paper focuses on the quality of studies using the Cosmin checklist to assess methodological quality in three articles. It compares parents' health-regarding life with that of controls in children with brain tumors. In this study, we examine the effect of hypnosipation on pain and anxiety among children who have been treated for acutely leukemia. The results show that there is a significant difference in the severity of pain when compared to when it is experienced by healthy children."
16867188,"In this paper, the incidence of nausea and duration of pain among patients with Major Depressive disorder treated with the novel anti-depressant drug duloxeten is compared. The number of patients received each regimen was as follows: placebo n = 757; dulopetine 40mg/d. N = 177; paroixet 20ml/D."" Pramipexele a dope D2 receptor antagonist, rated in 174 depressed patients without melancholy or psychotic features, were tested in three daily doses at twenty mg and placebo for depression. A double blinded study comparing the tolerability and safety of two different drugs in major depressive outpatients showed that more patients on both treatments improved than those on placebo. This paper also discusses the use of indirect methods for evaluating the efficaciousness of treatment. It concludes by identifying some of the most commonly used indirect comparisons."
21838650,"A recent issue of the journal of Pediatric psychology includes papers focused on ""evidence-based assessment"" across several broad areas of assessment in children. Holmbeck and Wollstonecraft present a list of measures that have been used to assess psychosocial adjustment, but they lack sufficient supporting psychometric evidence for them. This paper is an attempt to develop 'a checklist' for authors who will use this information when developing new measures for older adults with anxiety. Although anxiety is common in older people, few controlled trials have examined treatment efficacy for late life anxiety; however, recent studies suggest that in certain cases, pharmacological treatment may be better. As yet, there have not been systematic studies investigatingprognostic factor for the outcome from cognitive-behaavioral therapy -- CBT -- and  pharmacycotherapy for Late-life anxiety disorder. The aim of this study is to study long term treatment outcomes and explore differences between short-term or long-time treatment outcome of sertralline and Cbt for both brief-live anxiety disorders and late-Life anxiety conditions. Older adult with generalized anxious disorder was assigned to Cockpit /Dig, organized around worries-provoking topics, or another waiting period. After completion of their treatment, participants in both active condition improved relative tothe waiting list. They also found only Isignificant difference immediately aftertreatment and no changes at six month follow-up. Aged subjects are prone to anxiety because of increasing numbers of health care resources. In addition, elderly patients are particularly susceptible to confounding risk factors such as vulnerability, stress, and network-relational factors. There is little research on the prognoses of anxiety in old age. However, the Hospital Anaxiety and Depressed Scale has been validated by Cronbach's results. Other studies have suggested that the severity of depression can be measured using the hospital anxiness and depression scale. These studies indicate that it is difficult to predict the presence of depressed symptoms in later life."
25913420,"In this paper, we examine the effects of physical activity on health in a large sample of healthy adults. We use an accelerometer-based approach to track changes in blood pressure and lipoprotein concentrations over time. The results suggest that lifestyle changes soon after Type 2 may improve blood flow and glucose concentration in people with type 2 who have been previously treated for Type 1 disease."
29457570,"In this study, we demonstrate that infants fed a cow's milk formula with either prebiotics Polydextrose or galacto Oligoscharides have higher bfidophagia than those fed only breastfed. We also show that the composition of gut-microbial communities is similar to that found in healthy term children. The aim here is to compare the effect of two different types of infant formulas: one with polydexrose and another with gallaceooligosesaccharide. This study determines the effects of adding an additional dose of specific precarious ingredients to infant feeding on the frequency of fever outbreaks in the early years of life. A control group receives no more than four g/ L of GOS at any given time. After six weeks, the number of Fever Epigraphs per day are calculated. For example, after three days, there is not much difference between the numbers of Pg1 and G1 for fever episodes. Furthermore, it does not differ in stool characteristics as measured by stool samples from birth until 3 days before they are taken to adulthood."
22008401,"The aim of this study is to compare the effect of incentive breath stacking with deep breathing exercises on patients undergoing chest surgery. In this paper, we describe a single blinded clinical trial in which all patients were divided into two groups: exercise control group, performing only drills and using incentive spriometry; is group instructed to perform long breaths by forced pirometer; and no group was assigned to any other group. We conclude that these three groups are highly similar in terms of patient size, age, and location. A prospective open-label pilot study has been performed in order to determine whether incentive airway pressure can prevent postoperative complications after coronary bypass graftting. This study uses an extended inspiratory period to assess the effects of incentives on lung function. It is found that both groups have significantly improved lung functions during the first week of the procedure."
30320723,"In this paper, we describe a novel approach to treating atrial fibrillation using cryo balloon technology. We report the results of an eight-month follow-up study in which patients with paroxismal atrium fibrillation were ablationed by two-generation cryomembry balloons or contact force electrodes. The outcome was similar to that of other methods. A propensity Score matching analysis was performed to analyze safe and efficacious outcomes. This study compares the short-lived duration of catheterization with the longer-term use of second- generation cryodyne balloon as an alternative for treatment of persisting atarrhythmical relapses after drug-reflection. Although there are few studies on long- term outcomes of cryomatosal arlation, it is reported that Cryobellogon abulation has been more successful than either method."
30397494,"The aim of this study is to determine the effect of exercise on blood glucose levels in type 1 patients. In this paper, we describe a two-pronged approach: 1) an intense exercise regimen that involves continuous high intensity exercise and 2) moderate intensity exercises. Both results lead to systolic blood sugar levels declining as the duration of the exercise program declines. However, the lack of insulin release accounts for the frequent consumption of excessively large amounts of carbohydrate during exercise in Type 1 diabetes. This study further investigates the need for additional exercise to prevent hypoglucemia in subjects with Type1 diabetes mellitateus. Seven healthy subjects were assigned different intensities at different times intervals after day subcutaneous insulin administration. These subjects performed three different tests: maximal incremental exercise, high-intentione interval exercise; and moderate-intermittent exercise. They measured blood glutathiasis and their response to exercise when compared to control subjects who did not receive adequate amount of food. A total of thirteen patients with type 1, including 12 men and 1 woman, were studied. Eight male subjects served as their own control and were rested after full doses of basal or lispra Insulin regimen. Results showed that the fullpremeal insulin was associated with increased risk of epiglycia. At all intensitys, however, it was possible to reduce the current dose by using blargine instead of glulizine."
32242450,"In this paper, we describe a double blinded, placebo controlled trial of flicit in 14 children with obsesolate-compulsed disorder. The results indicate that fluoxetine significantly improves the severity of OCD compared to placebo; however, there is no significant difference between the two groups on the Children's Yale Brown Obsessionsive Comppulsives Scale. A second study comparing fluoxine and citalopram for treatment of obsessesively compulsesive disorder has been performed. This study compares fluvoxetine with citanolumram in patients who meet the DSM IIIR criteria for obsestive-compulsion disorder as determined by the Clinical Impression Impossibility scale."
27820540,"This paper focuses on the knowledge of stroke and its risk factors, symptoms, treatment, and information. It is based on a telephone interview survey in which 1278 people were asked about their experiences with stroke. The majority of those who knew about stroke were better able to recognize signs of sudden weakness, vertigo, or clumsesiness than those without knowing about it. In addition, most patients realized that stroke was not preventable and did not need to be treated. Furthermore, there are few structured care programs for stroke patients. A Stroke Protection program has been developed to prevent thromboemboic events through coordinated treatment. Although evidence demonstrates that risk factor management is highly effective in preventing strokes, many patients do not receive adequate care at hospital discharge. For example, an ""integrated care for the reduction of secondary stroke"" model of care uses nurses, physicians, patient's general practitioners, health education, smoking cessations, exercise, lifestyle counseling, etc. These studies have been published in many different forms. However, no one has yet attempted to apply these methods to stroke survivors."
24256847,"In this paper, we present the results of a prospective study on elderly patients with lung cancer. We describe the efficacy and safety of weekly docotaxel/gesmcitabine followed by erylotinibe after progression in fit elderly people with advanced non large-cell lung disease. This trial was designed to assess the ability of regimens to improve quality of life for older patients who have been previously treated with conventional treatment. The outcome was an overall survival rate of 70 % and remission rates of 46 %) for the first two treatments."
27820577,"Heart failure treatment guideline emphasizes daily weight tracking for patients with severe heart failure, but studies have found this approach to reduce re hospitalization and mortality. A telephony-based system is used to track the changes in patient weight over time. The results of this trial are as follows: patients who receive weekly weight checks have a lower rate of readmission than those who do not receive them. This study also focuses on the use of remote medical technology to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from congestive hearts failure. In this study, we examine the effect of home-centered care on improving the outcome of chronic heart failing patients. We find that patients treated with home health care experience less frequent emergency department visits and shorter length of stay in the hospital than they did before."
29478018,"A population-based cohort study is designed to assess the effect of an Mediterranean diet on adherence to this diet. The results suggest that greater fidelity to the Mediterranean's diet may reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke in older Europeans. In particular, there is some evidence that a Mediterranean-inspired diet can lead to lower blood levels of typhoid and other harmful circulating prothromboses."
25939649,"Digoxin, a diuretic, and an anti-arrhythmic drug, has not been shown to be effective in treating heart failure. In this study, we examine the association between blood levels of digoxiin and mortality in adult patients with atrium fibrillation. The results of the first two studies suggest that it may be beneficial for patients who have permanent atrial fibrillation because they are more likely to die than receive other treatment options. This study also suggests that there is some risk of side-effects associated with using such drugs."
28560516,"A prospective, i.e. single-blind study comparing the safety and long-term outcome of atrial fibrillation with that of patients without a pacemaker is presented. In this study, we examine the association between the duration of preprocededural sinusrhythms and the risk of persistent atrium fibrillation in patients who undergo ablation. The results suggest that the longest interval of PR interval is probably the most likely to lead to persistent AF. This study also identifies factors associated with early and late recurring musculosis after abduction."
