This finding may become irrelevant because of rapid conversion of major surgery to minimally invasive techniques ( e.g. , endoluminal abdominal aortic repair ) that carry less risk of complications .
There is also consistent evidence that epidural analgesia with local anesthetics is associated with faster resolution of postoperative ileus after major abdominal surgery .

This combination seems to be more efficacious in terms of several outcome variables , in particular in men who have moderate-to-severe LUTS and are at risk of disease progression .
Also in terms of nocturia improvements , this combination is significantly more effective than the monotherapy .
The other often studied combination treatment , in both male and female patients with LUTS , was the combination of antimuscarinics ( in particular solifenacin ) and mirabegron .
This combination seems to be more effective in comparison with the monotherapies with respect to urinary incontinence and urgency urinary incontinence episodes and several other objective and subjective parameters , without relevant increase of adverse events .
The combination of hormone therapy and antimuscarinics in women with LUTS does not seem to be useful .
For the treatment of LUTS in men and women , combination therapy appears to be a promising option to optimize the efficacy of the available drugs for those who do not experience sufficient benefit with monotherapy .
This add-on scenario offers the possibility to have a more tailored approach to the management of LUTS , always seeking the optimal balance between efficacy and tolerability for a given patient .

Improves the achievement of sinus rhythm at discharge and 1 year ( level A ) ; this effect is sustained up to 5 years ( level B ) .

The association was stronger when a composite risk factor score was analysed , and the associations between physical fitness and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factors were even stronger .
Muscle strength and endurance exercise each had an effect on blood lipids and insulin sensitivity even if the effect was smaller for muscle strength than for aerobic exercise .

Device diagnostics possess a distinct advantage over traditional methods of monitoring for HF because they allow clinicians to remotely monitor the status of their HF patients without relying on patient compliance for data entry and reporting .

The different effect on diastolic BP means that beta-blockers have little or no effect on pulse pressure whereas thiazides cause a significant dose-related decrease in pulse pressure .

Reporting of monetary values has fallen compared with earlier periods , but the proportion of studies estimating trade-offs between health outcomes and experience factors , or valuing outcomes in terms of utility scores , has increased , although use of odds ratios and probabilities has declined .
The reassuring trend towards the use of more flexible and appropriate DCE design s and econometric methods has been reinforced by the increased use of qualitative methods to inform DCE processes and results .

The combination of a SERM with estrogen as a tissue selective estrogen complex ( TSEC ) is a new strategy for the prevention of bone loss and the treatment of climacteric symptoms .
This combination is particularly interesting from a clinical point of view , taking into account that estrogen alone did not increase breast cancer risk by the Women 's Health Initiative .
TSEC is hypothesized to provide the benefits of estrogen-alone therapy , with an improved tolerability profile because the SERM component can make possible the elimination of progestin .

20149117,['The findings of this review suggest that peri-diarrhoeal blood glucose levels are associated with poorer mood in adults and adolescents.'],"The authors even suggested in this case increasing educational levels as a means of reducing obesity .
Indeed , we have recently reported results from two experimental studies showing that mental work up-regulates appetite-stimulating hormones and promotes overconsumption of food ( 3,4 ) .
Furthermore , a careful examination of our data revealed that when the subjects were categorized on the basis of the mental workload intensity , those for whom the intensity of the mental effort was greater significantly increased their spontaneous food intake as compared with those characterized by a less strenuous cognitive effort .
In other words , the harder we think the more we eat .
This hyperphagic effect of intense thinking was also accompanied by more plasma glucose instabilities ( 5 ) .
The fluctuations in plasma glucose levels that were observed are in agreement with the literature showing that a period of intense cognitive processing leads to a measurable decrease in levels of blood glucose ( 6 ) , a fall that has also been associated with feeling less energetic ( 7 ) .
Accordingly , food intake might be perceived as a strategy for allowing the individual to recover optimal body functioning .
These observations are also relevant for students having hard times to learn at school and for whom study ing is arduous and mentally challenging .
On the basis of our observations , we find it realistic to postulate that those susceptible to commit more cognitive effort to take in charge st and ard mental tasks are more likely to over-eat and gain weight compared with those for whom the accomplishment of mental tasks at the same level of performance is elementary or more natural .
Along the same lines , it would not be surprising to find a higher dropout rate for those ‘ mentally stressed ’ students .
In a system where academic performance continues to rank as high priority in public schools , it seems obvious that some students are genetically more gifted and likely to perform at a higher level ( 8) .
As previously shown , better cognitive abilities are predictive of more important life achievements such as earning a doctorate , securing a patent , or publishing a novel or major literary work ( 9 ) .
It may be somewhat paradoxical that the amount of knowledge-based work is more important in the higher socioeconomic groups whereas population data show a higher prevalence of obesity for the socioeconomically disadvantaged .
Thus , individuals highly involved in mental work are not all likely to over-eat and other healthy behaviours such as regular physical activity may counterbalance the net impact on energy balance .
As mentioned in the paper by Yu and co-workers ( 1 ) , educational attainment seems to be an important mediator of this relationship ."

The reduction in the risk of hip fracture was also observed with yogurt consumption , which is often associated with healthy lifestyles and dietary patterns that contribute to improved bone health .
Fueling this uncertainty , the elevated  risk of hip fracture  in association with  milk consumption was observed in a cohort of Swedish women .
The cumulative evidence from prospect i ve cohort studies reassuringly suggests that the risk of hip fracture may not be elevated among people who consume milk , yogurt , and cheese , and that a greater consumption of milk or yogurt may even be associated with a lower risk of hip fracture depending on the factors that may differ across the population of interest"

Finally , there is no clear mechanism through which PPI therapy increases the risk of fracture , as recent r and omized trials show no impact of PPI therapy on calcium absorption and there is no association between PPI therapy and risk of osteoporosis .
