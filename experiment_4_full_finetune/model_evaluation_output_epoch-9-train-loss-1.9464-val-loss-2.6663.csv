This finding may become irrelevant because of rapid conversion of major surgery to minimally invasive techniques ( e.g. , endoluminal abdominal aortic repair ) that carry less risk of complications .
There is also consistent evidence that epidural analgesia with local anesthetics is associated with faster resolution of postoperative ileus after major abdominal surgery .
Again , this finding may also become irrelevant with the adoption of laparoscopic techniques and multimodal fast-track programs for abdominal surgery .
There is no current evidence that perineural analgesia , continuous wound catheters using local anesthetics , IV patient-controlled analgesia with opioids , or addition of multimodal systemic analgesics have any clinical ly significant beneficial effect on postoperative complications .

This combination seems to be more efficacious in terms of several outcome variables , in particular in men who have moderate-to-severe LUTS and are at risk of disease progression .
Also in terms of nocturia improvements , this combination is significantly more effective than the monotherapy .
The other often studied combination treatment , in both male and female patients with LUTS , was the combination of antimuscarinics ( in particular solifenacin ) and mirabegron .
This combination seems to be more effective in comparison with the monotherapies with respect to urinary incontinence and urgency urinary incontinence episodes and several other objective and subjective parameters , without relevant increase of adverse events .
The combination of hormone therapy and antimuscarinics in women with LUTS does not seem to be useful .
For the treatment of LUTS in men and women , combination therapy appears to be a promising option to optimize the efficacy of the available drugs for those who do not experience sufficient benefit with monotherapy .
This add-on scenario offers the possibility to have a more tailored approach to the management of LUTS , always seeking the optimal balance between efficacy and tolerability for a given patient .

The findings from this review indicate that device diagnostic parameters predict impending HF much earlier than traditional methods of monitoring do .
Device diagnostics are also more accurate in the early prediction of HF when compared with noninvasive objective measures , particularly when multiple parameters are combined and monitored for trends .
Device diagnostics possess a distinct advantage over traditional methods of monitoring for HF because they allow clinicians to remotely monitor the status of their HF patients without relying on patient compliance for data entry and reporting .

Our review of the literature on determinants demonstrates that intentions , habits , self-regulatory skills , and the social and physical environment are the most important determinants of a healthy diet , which are in turn amenable to change by intervention strategies with varying levels of effectiveness .
Educational interventions generally show a limited effect on practising a healthy diet whereas interventions targeting habitual behaviour and /or the physical environment seem more promising .

The different effect on diastolic BP means that beta-blockers have little or no effect on pulse pressure whereas thiazides cause a significant dose-related decrease in pulse pressure .

A relatively high level of physical activity was related to better cognitive function and reduced risk of developing dementia ; however , there were mixed results of the effects of exercise interventions on cognitive function indices .
Conclusions There is a consistency of findings across studies and a range of outcome measures related to functional independence ; regular aerobic activity and short-term exercise programmes confer a reduced risk of functional limitations and disability in older age .
Although a precise characterization of a minimal or effective physical activity dose to maintain functional independence is difficult , it appears moderate to higher levels of activity are effective and there may be a threshold of at least moderate activity for significant outcomes"

Catatonic patients responded significantly better to ECT than patients with any other subtype of schizophrenia .

However , the trend towards including fewer attributes was reversed , whilst the trend towards interview-based DCEs reversed because of increased computer administration .

Reporting of monetary values has fallen compared with earlier periods , but the proportion of studies estimating trade-offs between health outcomes and experience factors , or valuing outcomes in terms of utility scores , has increased , although use of odds ratios and probabilities has declined .
The reassuring trend towards the use of more flexible and appropriate DCE design s and econometric methods has been reinforced by the increased use of qualitative methods to inform DCE processes and results .
However , qualitative research methods are being used less often to inform attribute selection , which may make DCEs more susceptible to omitted variable bias if the decision framework is not known prior to the research project ."

Carvedilol had little or no effect on pulse pressure ( -1 mm Hg ) and did not change BP variability .

The combination of α1-blocker/5-ARI shows a slightly increased rate of adverse events .
It remains unknown whether its safety and superiority over either drug as monotherapy are sustained after > 6 yr .
The α1-blocker/muscarinic receptor antagonist ( antimuscarinic ) combination was most frequently assessed as an add-on therapy to already existing α1-blocker therapy .
Inconsistent data derive from heterogeneous study population s and different study design s. Currently , the α1-blocker/antimuscarinic combination appears to be a second-line add-on for patients with insufficient symptom relief after monotherapy .
The combination seems to be safe in men with postvoid residual < 200 ml .
The α1-blocker/phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor combination is a new treatment option with only preliminary reports .
CONCLUSIONS An α1-blocker/5-ARI combination is beneficial for patients whose prostate volume is between 30 ml and 40 ml when medical treatment is intended for > 1 yr .

The combination of a SERM with estrogen as a tissue selective estrogen complex ( TSEC ) is a new strategy for the prevention of bone loss and the treatment of climacteric symptoms .
This combination is particularly interesting from a clinical point of view , taking into account that estrogen alone did not increase breast cancer risk by the Women 's Health Initiative .

29257898,['XPD is an effective and safe treatment for ASD in children with ASD'],"The results revealed that findings are becoming increasingly nuanced with variations in levels of evidence related to ages of the children and characteristics of the specific treatment .
In addition , we focused our critique on generalization of treatment effects across setting s and time and on sample diversity ( with regard to ethnicity and levels of parent education ) in relation to the population .
Children of parents with higher levels of education than average appear to be overrepresented in the literature ."
20149117,['The findings of this meta- analysis suggest that a higher glycaemic response is associated with greater mood in healthy young adults.'],"The authors even suggested in this case increasing educational levels as a means of reducing obesity .
Indeed , we have recently reported results from two experimental studies showing that mental work up-regulates appetite-stimulating hormones and promotes overconsumption of food ( 3,4 ) .
Furthermore , a careful examination of our data revealed that when the subjects were categorized on the basis of the mental workload intensity , those for whom the intensity of the mental effort was greater significantly increased their spontaneous food intake as compared with those characterized by a less strenuous cognitive effort .
In other words , the harder we think the more we eat .
This hyperphagic effect of intense thinking was also accompanied by more plasma glucose instabilities ( 5 ) .
The fluctuations in plasma glucose levels that were observed are in agreement with the literature showing that a period of intense cognitive processing leads to a measurable decrease in levels of blood glucose ( 6 ) , a fall that has also been associated with feeling less energetic ( 7 ) .
Accordingly , food intake might be perceived as a strategy for allowing the individual to recover optimal body functioning .
These observations are also relevant for students having hard times to learn at school and for whom study ing is arduous and mentally challenging .
On the basis of our observations , we find it realistic to postulate that those susceptible to commit more cognitive effort to take in charge st and ard mental tasks are more likely to over-eat and gain weight compared with those for whom the accomplishment of mental tasks at the same level of performance is elementary or more natural .
Along the same lines , it would not be surprising to find a higher dropout rate for those ‘ mentally stressed ’ students .
In a system where academic performance continues to rank as high priority in public schools , it seems obvious that some students are genetically more gifted and likely to perform at a higher level ( 8) .
As previously shown , better cognitive abilities are predictive of more important life achievements such as earning a doctorate , securing a patent , or publishing a novel or major literary work ( 9 ) .
It may be somewhat paradoxical that the amount of knowledge-based work is more important in the higher socioeconomic groups whereas population data show a higher prevalence of obesity for the socioeconomically disadvantaged .
Thus , individuals highly involved in mental work are not all likely to over-eat and other healthy behaviours such as regular physical activity may counterbalance the net impact on energy balance .
As mentioned in the paper by Yu and co-workers ( 1 ) , educational attainment seems to be an important mediator of this relationship ."

23440795,"['Statin therapy is not associated with a reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality, stroke, or cardiovascular events.']","Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced in all trials but there was evidence of heterogeneity of effects .
There was no evidence of any serious harm caused by statin prescription .
Evidence available to date showed that primary prevention with statins is likely to be cost-effective and may improve patient quality of life .
Recent findings from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists study using individual patient data meta- analysis indicate that these benefits are similar in people at lower ( < 1 % per year ) risk of a major cardiovascular event .

30591077,['Conclusions The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis show that e-health interventions are effective in improving men and adolescents ’ fitness levels.'],"Results Based on consistent evidence from studies that were rated as moderate or strong , there is good evidence that military weight management interventions are effective in improving body composition for duration s of up to 12 months .
Effective interventions are more likely to be high intensity ( have a greater number of sessions ) , are more often delivered by specialists , and use theoretical base/behavioral change techniques and a st and ardized guideline .
Dietary interventions can potentially reduce total fat and saturated fat intake .
Dietary interventions that target the kitchen staff and /or increase the availability of healthy food are more likely to be effective in the short term .
The results regarding military physical fitness interventions were inconclusive .
Conclusion Despite limitations such as the diversity and heterogeneity of the included interventions , outcome measurements , and follow-up duration , this systematic review found good evidence that weight management interventions are effective , especially in terms of weight loss ."
